These scripts:

map_hs.pl

is used to parse and map the hot spot data into its parts for each line of
the MRDA corpus.


mrt2list*
mrt_tag*
post_process2*

were used to convert MRT transcripts to formats used for forced
alignment by the SRI Hub5 recognizer. This process involved changing
word spellings, collapsing or splitting hyphenated forms, and other
changes as described in /doc/transcription-issues.txt. Such
information is relevant to researchers using the time marks provided
from forced alignment.


use_cm.pl

is used to map da annotations into other classes according to the
mapping rules in a classmap file.
