Bmr016-c8_0418494_0418844,yeah .,yeah .
Bmr016-cb_0419614_0421024,okay so let's give that a try .,o_k so let's give that a try .
Bmr016-c4_0420660_0425020,okay | and is the spacing all right or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?,o_k | and is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?

Bmr016-c8_0449690_0455445,i - i was just going to say so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of - of recordings now .,i - i was just gonna say so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of - of recordings now .
Bmr016-c8_0455970_0458490,and you're saying two hours uh is digits .,and you're saying two hours uh is digits .
Bmr016-c8_0458490_0459790,so that's roughly the ratio then .,so that's roughly the ratio then .
Bmr016-c8_0459790_0461500,something like twenty - twenty to one .,something like twenty - twenty to one .
Bmr016-c4_0459965_0460175,yep .,yep .
Bmr016-c8_0461640_0463746,which i guess makes - makes sense .,which i guess makes - makes sense .
Bmr016-c8_0463746_0468106,so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .,so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .
Bmr016-c4_0467640_0467920,right .,right .
Bmr016-c8_0469003_0473643,um yeah like you say i think a couple hours for a - for a - for a test - test set's okay .,um yeah like you say i think a couple hours for a - for a - for a test - test set's o_k .
Bmr016-c8_0473986_0476016,it'd be nice to get you know more later .,it'd be nice to get you know more later .

Bmr016-c5_0482284_0487614,because it - it seems to me that um there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in - a whole bunch of times .,cuz it - it seems to me that um there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in - a whole bunch of times .
Bmr016-c5_0487614_0489834,and adding to that basic test bank .,and adding to that basic test bank .

Bmr016-c5_0496001_0502041,and i think um the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups .,and i think um the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups .
Bmr016-c5_0502201_0508407,and it might be - there might be an argument to be made for having uh f- - for replicating all of the digits that we've done .,and it might be - there might be an argument to be made for having uh f- - for replicating all of the digits that we've done .
