Bro012-c1_0832146_0832566,so ==,so ==
Bro012-c1_0833309_0848396,but one - one thing i - i wanted to check out before i increased the um - number of mixtures per state was uh - in their default training script they do an initial set of three re estimations .,but one - one thing i - i wanted to check out before i increased the um - number of mixtures per state was uh - in their default training script they do an initial set of three re-estimations .
Bro012-c1_0848857_0851587,and then they built the silence model .,and then they built the silence model .
Bro012-c1_0851807_0854977,and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures .,and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures .
Bro012-c1_0854977_0856927,and they do another seven then they add mixtures .,and they do another seven then they add mixtures .
Bro012-c1_0857258_0858968,then they do a final set of seven and they quit .,then they do a final set of seven and they quit .
Bro012-c1_0859344_0860954,seven seems like a lot to me .,seven seems like a lot to me .
Bro012-c1_0860954_0864194,and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time .,and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time .
Bro012-c1_0864604_0868584,i mean to do one turnaround of the well matched case takes like a day .,i mean to do one turn-around of the well matched case takes like a day .

Bro012-c0_0869000_0869570,uhhuh .,mm-hmm .
Bro012-c1_0869240_0876530,and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute the run on .,and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute the run on .
Bro012-c1_0876530_0880765,and so one of the things i did was i compiled h t k for the linux machines .,and so one of the things i did was i compiled h_t_k for the linux machines .
Bro012-c0_0880262_0880772,uhhuh .,mm-hmm .
Bro012-c1_0880875_0884345,because we have this one from i b m that's got like five processors in it .,cuz we have this one from i_b_m that's got like five processors in it .
Bro012-c0_0884690_0884930,right .,right .
Bro012-c1_0885025_0894437,and so now i'm - you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute .,and so now i'm - you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute .
Bro012-c3_0894730_0895010,uhhuh .,mm-hmm .
