Bro018-c2_3116160_3122410,yeah | w- - we're often asked this when we work with a system that - that isn't - isn't sort of industry - industry standard great .,yeah | w- - we're often asked this when we work with a system that - that isn't - isn't sort of industry - industry standard great .
Bro018-c1_3122200_3122480,uhhuh .,uh-huh .
Bro018-c2_3123100_3126070,uh - and we see some reduction in error using some clever method .,uh - and we see some reduction in error using some clever method .
Bro018-c2_3126170_3129390,then you know will it work on a - on a - on a good system ?,then you know will it work on a - on a - on a good system ?
Bro018-c2_3129390_3131380,so uh ==,so uh ==
Bro018-c2_3132200_3133840,you know this other one's - it was a pretty good system .,you know this other one's - it was a pretty good system .
Bro018-c2_3133840_3141150,i think you know one - one percent word error rate on digits is - uh - digit strings is not uh - you know stellar .,i think you know one - one percent word error rate on digits is - uh - digit strings is not uh - you know stellar .
Bro018-c2_3141150_3145640,but - but given that this is real digits as opposed to uh - sort of laboratory ==,but - but given that this is real digits as opposed to uh - sort of laboratory ==
Bro018-c1_3143110_3143280,uhhuh .,mm-hmm .
Bro018-c2_3146270_3146570,well ==,well ==
