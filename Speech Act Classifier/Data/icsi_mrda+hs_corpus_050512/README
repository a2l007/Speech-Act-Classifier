MRDA Corpus Structure:


align_mrt_dadb/	Files containing information on the punctuations given by
		both the MRT and DADB files.

classmaps/ 	Sample maps for grouping full DA labels into smaller number
		of meaningful sets.


data/  		Database files for all 75 meetings in DADB format.


doc/   		Documentation on manual labeling, database format, transcript
  |		mappings, and other information to be aware of before
  |		using this corpus.
  |
  |--lists/	Tables and lists of information on transcripts
  |		and alignments, reject words, recognizer vocabulary,
  |		meeting labeler information, etc.
  |
  |--manuals/	Annotation manuals
  |
  |
  |--paper/	4-page overview paper(Proc. SIGDIAL 2004)
  |
  |
  |--release_updates/	Documents changes and additions from earlier releases


 
reliability/	Statistics on segmentation agreement (using word-based
		measure) and DA agreement (using Kappa), for randomly
		sampled chunks from different meetings. Raw annotations
		for the chunks are also included.  Report on hot spot
		annotation agreement, using more complex methods.


scripts/	Various scripts used to convert MRT transcripts to formats
		used for forced alignment by SRI Hub5 recognizer and to
		create classmaps.
