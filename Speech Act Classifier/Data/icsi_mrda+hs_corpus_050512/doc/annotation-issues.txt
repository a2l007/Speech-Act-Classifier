This file describes potential internal annotation inconsistencies,
which should be understood by researchers modeling the affected tags.

-  It is difficult to decide between <b> or <s^bk> when a speaker
   produces for example a "yeah" after their own speech.  We
   found that some annotators tended to prefer the former while others
   prefered the latter.

-  It is difficult to determine whether words like "okay," "uhhuh," or
   "yeah" function as <b>'s, <s^bk>'s, or <s^aa>'s when a speaker is
   providing feedback or responding to a previous speaker.  We found
   that some annotators tended to prefer different labels and that their
   preferences changed as their annotation skills developed.

-  It is difficult to know when to segment strings of floor-holders 
   (<fh>) like "um" and "uh" into separate DAs, particularly because
   floor holders by their nature tend to be produced with drawn-out
   prosody.  Thus, there may be inconsistencies in whether such
   strings are kept as one DA or split into multiple DAs.

-  It is difficult to know whether or not to segment utterances 
   right after an aside.  They can be segmented in either of two ways: 

	Beginning of thought ==
	Aside .
	Completed thought .
   or
	Beginning of thought ==
	Aside and completed thought .


- The label <sj> was used in early meetings, but later merged with <s>
  because it is inherently difficult categorize statements as to whether
  they are subjective or not.  However, since the label may be useful for
  some purposes, meetings that were labeled before the merge occurred have
  the <sj> label preserved in the database as an "original label" (see
  "database-format.txt").

  The list below specifies the meetings labeled before <sj> was merged
  with <s>, ordered by frequency of occurrence of the <sj> tag:

- There may be inconsistencies as to how the word "right" is treated at the
  end of an utterance by different annotators.  Sometimes, the word "right"
  is on the same line as previous speech by the same speaker and the "right"
  is labeled with a question tag (<^g>) after the pipebar.  At other times,
  the "right" is on the next line.  The length of silence between the
  previous speech and the "right" was the main determining factor as to
  how the annotators segment utterances ending with the question, "Right?"

- It is difficult to decide whether an utterance should be labeled with an
  <s^ba>.  The judgement as to whether a speaker is providing an assessment
  proved to be ambiguous for annotators.

- The annotation for phrases like "you know," "okay," "right," and "let's see"
  may have some inconsistencies.  There are specific speaker patterns as to
  the uses of these phrases and the annotation of each of these phrases
  by one speaker may have affected the way annotators labeled these words,
  even when they were uttered by other speakers.  This was particularly
  the case when "you know," "okay," and "right" were used by a speaker to
  encourage feedback from others or to check whether listeners were
  following along.  The phrase "let's see" was difficult to annotate because
  it was unclear to annotators whether this word functioned as a hold,
  self-talk, or a floor-holder.

- The annotation of all positive answers (<aa>, <aap>, <na>) and
  all negative answers (<ar>, <arp>, <nd>, <nd>) differed within
  these two types of answers.  The use of short words and phrases
  such as "well no" or "oh yeah" were either included as part of
  narrative answer or were distinguished from following speech by
  the same speaker depending on the prosody of these short phrases.
  We found that some annotators tended to prefer different labels
  and that their preferences changed as their annotation skills
  developed.

- It is difficult to determine when an utterance should be labeled
  with an elaboration tag (<e>), a defending/explanation tag (<df>),
  or both.  Annotators had their preferences as to how to annotate
  utterances with <e> and <df> and their preferences changed as their
  annotation skills developed.

- The determination of the duration of an adjancy pair (AP) differed
  by each annotator.  Some annotators prefered to include many utterances
  as the "a" part of an AP by using several "+" signs in a row.  Other
  annotators interpreted the content of each AP part to be much shorter
  and therefore used very few "+" signs in their AP annotation.

- The use of "anyway" as a <tc> differed among the annotators until
  agreement among all the annotators was made that "anyway" cannot alone
  be deemed as a topic-changer.

- Adjacency pairs (APs) are not included when one AP part is an utterance
  that does not come from a headset microphone.  In such cases, the
  annotator could hear this utterance and determine that it was an AP part
  but had no means of labeling it as such since the utterance did not show
  up in transcription even if the other part of the AP did show up in
  transcription.

- It was difficult to determine when an utterance functioned as an 
  elaboration alone or whether it also functioned as another dialog
  act.  Therefore, there were differences between the annotators in
  whether the specific tags of an utterance included other tags other
  than <^e>.  This is especially true when the speaker of an utterance
  gives a suggestion or an explanation and then elaborates on it.

- The use of <t> and <tc> in labels differed among annotators until
  the differences were sorted out by the annotators.  Before the
  agreement, some annotators chose to label utterances with just a
  <t>, just a <tc>, or with both tags.

- After consensus among the annotators, it was decided that only one
  pipebar is permitted per utterance.  Therefore, when there are three
  DAs that characterize the speech of one speaker and all three
  correspond to one another, the annotators would use prosody to judge
  where segmentation should occur among the three tags.  For example,
  if there is an <fg>, an <s^aa>, and lastly, an <s^aa>, the annotator
  may choose to segment the transcribed speech as one of the following
  depending on the timing and prosody of the speech:
  <fg>
  <s^na>
  <s^aa>

  or

  <fg>
  <s^na|s^aa>

  or

  <fg|s^na>
  <s^aa>


- The interpretation of whether an entire utterance was abandoned or
  just the quoted material was abandoned differed by annotators.
  Therefore, there are differences between the annotators in labels such
  as in the following examples:
  <s.%--:qy.%--> vs. <s:qy.%--> vs. <s.%--:qy>
