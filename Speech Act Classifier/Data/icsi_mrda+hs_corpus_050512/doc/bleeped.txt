Bleeped Regions:

The ICSI Meeting Corpus contains regions where participants requested
censorship.  In each of these regions, the audio on all channels has been
replaced with a pure tone, and the transcript has been replaced with a tag
marking the censorship of that region.

In this release, all transcript information that occurs in bleeped regions
is replaced with a single line for each channel.  This line is of the form:

<StartTime>,<EndTime>,B,,,<Meeting/ChannelInfo>,,,,BLEEPED,BLEEPED

where:
	<StartTime> is the beginning of the bleeped region.
	<EndTime> is the end of the bleeped region.
	<Meeting/ChannelInfo> is of the form described in the database format
			      description file database-format.txt.

Please note that bleeped lines have no DA label.
