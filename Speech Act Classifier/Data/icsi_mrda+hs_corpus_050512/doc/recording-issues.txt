This file lists problems or oddities in specific channel recordings
that database users should be aware of.


-    in meeting Bmr001, channel c8 is very soft around 1421s, so
     the words "don't know how to i don't know how the operating system
     would like having two sound cards" were not aligned

-    in meeting Bmr002, channel c2 becomes very soft around 1250s, so
     the words "transcriber support and then automated alignment of what
     the transcribers give you which is you know exactly the problem we
     have" were not aligned

-    in meeting Bed010,  channel c0 is very soft and is 
     therefore missing a fair amount of segment timing data
     due to nonalignment

-    in meeting Bmr012, two speakers shared channel c0. This
     is marked in the comment field, as "CHANGE OF SPEAKER"

-    in meeting Bsr001, one speaker is present on channels c0 and c8.
     The duplicated channel is marked in the comment field as 
     "DUPLICATED-MICROPHONE"
