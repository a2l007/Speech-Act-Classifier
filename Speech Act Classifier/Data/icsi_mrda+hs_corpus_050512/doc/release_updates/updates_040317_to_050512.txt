This file summarizes the changes made from the 040317 release to
the present release (050512).

Note: A main addition in this release from all earlier releases is
Hot Spot annotations and information, which is described further
down in the list below.





---------------------------------
DA Label Lists and Mapping Script
---------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: The DA lists describe the unique DAs found in the data, and with
the mapping script can create new expanded classmaps.


A list of the 2083 unique DA labels found in the MRDA corpus was compiled
and placed in the classmaps/ directory (named da_list).

If the DA labels are split at the pipe bar '|' into two separate labels,
there are 64 labels not found in da_list.  These 64 labels were added to
those in da_list to form another list (called da_list_w_split).

The script use_cm.pl is included in this release, so that with the DA lists
you can generate explicit mappings (see next section) according to your
desired classes.


-----------------
Revised Classmaps
-----------------
SYNOPSIS: It is recommended that you use the revised classmaps (with the b
suffix) over the originals, because they do a better job of grouping the
labels.  Experiments at ICSI use the revised classmaps.


Five revised classmaps are included in this new release of the MRDA Corpus
data.  These five classmaps are revised versions of their original
counterparts (found in the classmaps/ directory), where certain DA labels
were reassigned to different classes.  The new classmaps are also located in
the classmaps/ directory with a "b" after the classmap name, denoting it
is a revised version of the original classmap, e.g. "map_02b" is a revised
version of "map_02".

The expanded versions of these revised classmaps are also given, and named
with the suffix "_expanded" appended at the end.  The expanded versions are
obtained by applying the classmaps "top-down" on each unique DA label given
in da_list.  In other words, the first mapping rule that applies to a label
(when looking top-down in the classmap file) is what is used to map the
label.  This is done for each label in the list.

Files in the classmaps/ directory with the suffix "_w_split" include the 64
labels found when splitting at the pipe bar '|'.

Please note that the expanded versions of the original classmaps were
obtained by applying the classmaps "bottom-up".

Note also that the reliability data included in the reliability/ directory is
still based on the original five classmaps, not the revised mappings.


--------------------------
Channel Name Normalization
--------------------------
SYNOPSIS: No channel assignments were changed, only the case of lettered
channels in some instances, so previous experiments should remain unchanged
if these inconsistencies were handled properly through a post-process with
previous releases.


The channels "a" (or "A") and "b" (or "B") were occassionally inconsistent
in the MRDA data files.  In some instances, they were upper case
(e.g. Bdb001-cB) and in other cases they were lower case (e.g. Bmr022-ca).
In some cases the digits lines were upper case, while the rest of the
meeting were lower case.  We normalized all channels to all be lower case.
(Note that the meeting names still contain the upper case first letter,
e.g. Bmr001.)

The following meetings had one or more occurrences of upper case channel
names that were normalized to be lower case:

	cA:
		Bed006
		Bmr007
		Bmr019
		Bmr022
		Bmr024
		Bmr025
		Bmr028
		Bmr031
		Bns001
		Bns003
		Bro024
		Bsr001
		Buw001

	cB:
		Bdb001
		Bed002
		Bmr005
		Bmr007
		Bmr010
		Bmr011
		Bmr012
		Bmr013
		Bmr014
		Bmr015
		Bmr016
		Bmr019
		Bmr024
		Bmr027
		Bmr028
		Bmr031
		Bns002
		Bro004
		Bro005
		Bro007
		Bro011
		Bro019
		Bro021
		Bro022
		Bro023
		Bro024
		Buw001


-----------------
Problem Pipe Line
-----------------
SYNOPSIS: This should have minimal impact on previous work since it is only
one line.  However, having a line not conforming to specifications could
potentially cause errors (e.g. when splitting at the pipe bar).  At ICSI,
when using the previous releases (040317 and earlier), this line was skipped.


In Bed003.dadb, there is one line that incorrectly has a pipe after all the
words in the transcription.  This line is:

3322.01,3328.19,A,3322.01+3328.19+mmm-yea-some,h|s.%--,Bed003-c1,h|s.%--,6b,FBH,huh yeah | some ==,mmm-yea-some | ==

This problem occurred because the original CSV which was labeled contained
three words "huh yeah some" and the labeler decided to put a pipe in between
the words "yeah" and "some".  However, in the MRT there is only one word
"mmm-yea-some".  A pipe cannot be in the middle of a word, so in the
automatic processing of the data, the pipe was moved to the end of the word.

To correct this line, we decided to remove the pipe altogether and keep the
s.%-- label, which is the more contentful of the two labels.  The new line
looks like:

3322.01,3328.19,A,3322.01+3328.19+mmm-yea-some,s.%--,Bed003-c1,s.%--,6b,FBH,huh yeah | some ==,mmm-yea-some ==


---------------------------
Misspelled Transcript Words
---------------------------
SYNOPSIS: These likely won't affect previous experiments much.  They could
potentially change a few features, but overall these corrections likely
wouldn't affect results.


Three lines were found to have a curly braced word next to an angled brace
word.  These had spelling errors that caused mismatches in the CSV and MRT
words.  We corrected the three lines by fixing the spelling errors.  The
three original lines are below:

--------------------------------
Incorrect Transcript Punctuation
--------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: Because this is only three lines, it won't have a significant
effect on previous work, unless these punctuation errors affected a
processing script which trickled down to other data.


Three DA segments had transcript punctuation errors.  These were corrected.
The corresponding .mpf files were changed accordingly as well.

The original lines are:

-------------------------
Incorrectly Matched Words
-------------------------
SYNOPSIS: The main impact of this subtle change is that the start times of
these segments may have changed.  Since the DA segments are sorted by start
time in the .dadb files, the placement of the corrected segments may have
changed as well.  Certain prosodic features may be affected also.  Overall,
since these make up a very small percentage of the data, previous work should
not change significantly with these corrections.


When reconciling forced alignment words to transcript words (see
doc/transcription-issues), a word match had to take place before times were
assigned to transcript words.  In a few cases the same word appeared twice
consecutively in the forced alignment, but the word appeared only once in the
transcript.  In these cases, the first alignment word was matched to the
transcript word, and the second alignment word was marked as an unmatched
MRT word (with angled braces surrounding the word).  We found 14 cases where
the transcript word matching should have occurred with the second alignment
word, leaving the first alignment word unmatched.

These have been corrected.  The files incorrect_match-{orig,corr}.txt in
doc/lists give the original and corrected lines, respectively.  In these
cases, the repeated word was at the start of the DA segment, and thus the
correction also changed the start time of the segment (because the start
time of the segment is the first matched word in the segment). On occassion,
the punctuation order (and the .mpf files in align_mrt_dadb/) was changed.
The Error Codes and the numbers given in doc/lists/transcript-matchrate.txt
were updated to reflect changes as well.


-----------------------
Mismatched Curly Braces
-----------------------
SYNOPSIS: These could potentially affect experimental results if they were
included, although in an insignificant way considering 97 lines are 0.09% of
the data.  At ICSI all these lines were ignored in experimentation.

97 DA lines (listed in doc/lists/mismatched_braces.txt) were missing curly
braces in the Transcription field.  In this release, the Transcription
fields added a set of curly braces around the "@@", and the Errorcodes were
changed from "A" to "Z" to reflect the change in the Transcription.  The
numbers given in doc/lists/transcript-matchrate.txt were updated to reflect
these changes.  Note that the channel name normalization was not applied to
this list, since it references the previous 040317 release.


--------------------
Overlapping DA Units
--------------------
SYNOPSIS: The easiest way to remove these overlap problems for
experimentation is to ignore all lines with errorcode "Z".  This would
remove other lines that only have unmatched CSV words, but would remove one
line for each overlapping pair as well.


Occassionally, two DA units from the same channel overlap in time.  While
a small overlap can be expected at times due to the way alignment is done,
larger overlaps are due to other phenomena.

The file overlaps.txt (in the doc/lists/ directory) logs the DA lines where
two utterances of the same channel overlap by more than 0.02 seconds.  In
each of these cases, one line consists only of words that do not match the
MRT (so the line has an errorcode Z, and there are curly braces around
every transcript word).  These unmatched words in the overlapping DA line
fall into several categories:

1. They are difficult to hear, and unmarked in the MRT transcripts.
   However, the DA labelers heard these fragments or words and added them
   as they labeled.
2. They are basically the same as words in the other DA line in the
   overlapping pair.  This indicates these words are likely redundant, and
   thus did not match MRT words in the automatic processing.
3. They are words not heard in the meeting audio.
4. They are either "@@" or "@reject@" cases that overlap with an existing
   line.
5. They are due to some other problem.

Note that this is a residual from some CSV generation and processing issues.
Because there were no words in the line that matched MRT words (and thus no
words that were matched to the output of the forced alignment), the start
and end times from the original CSV were preserved.  Often these times
overlap those of matched MRT words outputted in the forced alignment.

One overlapping line with errorcode Z contains important information not
found in the other overlapping line:

2579.95,2580.15,Z,XXXX+XXXX+{yup},s^aa,Bmr013-c8,s^aa,24b.25a,,yup .,{yup} .

The "^aa" part of the DA label and the "24b.25a" AP label are not seen in
in the other overlapping line:

2579.97,2585.35,A,2579.97+2580.18+yep|2580.61+2580.88+yep|2580.88+2581.1+so|2581.1+2581.16+it|2581.16+2581.57+was|2583.53+2583.65+it|2583.65+2583.79+was|2583.79+2584.4+advertised|2584.4+2584.55+for|2584.55+2585.35+performers,fg|s,Bmr013-c8,fg|s,,FBH,yep yep | so it was - it was advertised for performers .,yep yep | so it was - it was advertised for performers .

We changed the DA of this line from "fg|s" to "fg|s^aa", and we added the
AP "24b.25a" to preserve this info in case 'Z' errorcode lines were ignored.


----------------
Questionable APs
----------------
SYNOPSIS: It is recommended that the renumbered APs are used (see a few
sections down), which do not include the questionable APs and are unique in
index number in a meeting.  While the out of order APs may be legitimate, one
would need to manually insert them if one desires to include them for
research.


In certain instances, the AP label is in question.  This may be due to a
malfunction in one or more of the microphones involved, a mislabeled AP
that is ambiguous, a residual of data processing, or some other problem
that cannot easily be resolved.

Questionable APs are divided into two cases, each with a different marking
to differentiate them.  Case I is the general marking given, while Case II
is for a specific questionable AP.


Case I:
When a questionable AP part is found, if possible, it is corrected.
Otherwise, it is surrounded by the symbol '@'.  Please note that it is the
AP part that is surrounded, not necessarily the entire AP.  AP parts are the
units separated by the period '.' symbol.

Examples:
@6a@.7a
@44b@.45a
@64a+@
38b.@39a@

Large areas of AP problems:
Bed014 from about 3109s to 3172s
    All microphones are shut off except channel 1.  The conversation
    continues, but since the MRDA data only includes close-talking
    utterances, only channel 1 remains.
Bmr020 from about 1488s to 1557s
    Channel 1 has a problem with its microphone, and is only heard in
    the far-field microphones.


Case II:
A more specific case of questionable AP labels deals with when the AP parts
occur out of order, i.e. a DA segment where the "b" part precedes a DA
segment with the "a" part of the same AP.  For the majority of these cases,
the start times of the two DA segments are very close.  These "out of order"
AP parts may occur for several reasons:

1. The start times of the two DA segments are extremely close (less than
   0.05 seconds).  They were likely labeled in order, but after doing a
   forced alignment the timings changed slightly to place them out of
   order.
2. The "b" part does not occur at the beginning of the DA segment it is in,
   but later on.  Therefore, the words preceding where the "b" part occurs
   could have start times prior to when the DA segment with the "a" part
   begins.
3. There was some sort of labeler error for the AP pair.

Because the reasons for these "out of order" APs vary and cannot be
automatically determined, we simply surrounded these AP parts (and the other
AP parts with the same AP number) with the symbol '!' so they can be
identified and dealt with as desired.  Please note that only the "out of
order" AP part is surrounded in each case, not necessarily the entire AP.
AP parts are the units separated by the period '.' symbol.


---------
Fixed APs
---------
SYNOPSIS: If research has been done on the APs, it is recommended that the
renumbered AP markings be used for future research.  In previous releases the
APs did not go through a stringent error-checking phase like the DAs did.


In the earlier releases of this corpus, the AP labels were not as closely
checked as the DA annotations for syntax or other errors.  We were able to
make a pass at the AP labels in this release, correcting errors that we
found.  The errors and corrections are logged in doc/lists/fixed_aps.txt.
The corresponding lines in the .dadb files can be found using the Start and
Info fields.  A "FIXED AP" note was added to the Comments field in these
lines, except with the cases noted in the next two sections.  Note that the
channel name normalization was not applied to this list, since it references
the previous 040317 release.  The next two sections below describe two
specific errors that were addressed in this release.


--------------------
APs with fg/fh/b DAs
--------------------
SYNOPSIS: If research has been done on the APs, it is recommended that the
renumbered AP markings be used for future research.  In previous releases the
APs did not go through a stringent error-checking phase like the DAs did.


According to Section 4.4 of "Meeting Recorder Project: Dialog Act Labeling
Guide" (ICSI TR-04-002), DA segments with labels "fg" "fh" and "b" should
never be marked with APs.  However, there are several cases where these
segments have AP labels, even after a round of AP fixes (for other problems).
We removed these labels while adding the phrase "REMOVED AP" to the comments
field.  We also adjusted any affected APs, added the phrase "ADJUSTED AP" to
the comments field, and logged the adjustments in doc/lists/fixed_aps.txt.
136 APs were removed, and 130 APs were adjusted.  The file
doc/lists/fg_fh_b.txt lists the 136 removed APs.  Note that the channel name
normalization was not applied to this list, since it references the previous
040317 release.


----------------------------------
APs missing when DAs have ^m or ^2
----------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: If research has been done on the APs, it is recommended that the
renumbered AP markings be used for future research.  In previous releases the
APs did not go through a stringent error-checking phase like the DAs did.


Section 4.4 of "Meeting Recorder Project: Dialog Act Labeling Guide"
(ICSI TR-04-002) states that mimics (^m) and collaborative completions (^2)
are always marked with APs.  After a round of AP fixes and fixing cases for
fg/fh/b, we found 156 DA units in the corpus marked with ^m or ^2 that did
not have any AP markings.  These units are listed in doc/lists/m_2.txt.

We added the appropriate adjacency pair parts to almost all of these data and
added "INSERTED AP" to the comment field (or "ADJUSTED (M/2) AP" when an AP
part existed but was changed).  A small number of cases required a different
correction or were left without a label.  These cases are described in
doc/lists/m_2-exceptions.txt.

Some labels of ^2 or ^m occur with questionable APs.  These were investigated
and the proper corrections were made.  Sometimes this involved fixing
incorrect DA labels (a ^2 or a ^m that was inappropriate), fixing incorrect
APs, or both.  Fixed APs are noted in doc/lists/fixed_aps.txt.  Special
corrections are noted in doc/lists/m_2-exceptions.txt.


------------------------------------
matched_previously Internal markings
------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: This has little effect on the data and experiments, because only a
handful of these existed.

A residual of the automatic matching of original transcripts with MRT
transcripts (see doc/transcription-issues.txt) is that a handful of cases
failed to combine matched words when needed (when two words from forced
alignment mapped to one MRT transcript word).  This is seen when the Internal
Word Times field contains the word <matched_previously>.  Previous releases
had 8 such cases distributed over 7 DA segments.  These are listed below.

The <matched_previously> word was used as an intermediate placeholder word
so that the word times could be retained.  After word matching, we would
combine the <matched_previously> times with the previous word and remove the
placeholder.  However, as in the 8 cases mentioned above, the previous word
was an unmatched CSV word (a word surrounded by curly braces), so the times
were not combined automatically.

We manually corrected the times of the words for which these placeholders
existed.  Two files show the differences for each affected line before and
after the correction.  doc/lists/matched_previously-{orig,corr}.txt list the
original lines and corrected lines, respectively.


------------------------------------
<-> Transcript and Internal Markings
------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: This has little effect on the data and experiments, because only a
handful of these existed.


On 4 occassions in previous releases, an unmatched MRT word <-> is marked in
the data.  These are extraneous and were removed from both the Transcription
and Internal Words Time fields, and the Error Code was changed accordingly.
The four original lines are listed in doc/lists/dash-in-trans.txt.


--------------
Renumbered APs
--------------
SYNOPSIS: If research has been done on the APs, it is recommended that the
renumbered AP markings be used for future research.  In previous releases the
APs did not go through a stringent error-checking phase like the DAs did.


Because of the inconsistency in AP indexing (see the "General AP Indexing
Notes section" in doc/ap-indexing.txt), a renumbering of the APs was done,
with the result in the Adjacency Pair field.  The APs before renumbering are
preserved in the Original Adjacency Pair.

The renumbering was done as follows:
      1. First, we assume that the DA lines are sorted by start time.
         (They are already sorted this way in the .dadb files.)
      2. Stepping through line by line, begin numbering AP indices in
         multiples of 10, leaving the rest unchanged.
      3. When there are multiple speakers per AP part, number according
         to order of appearance (e.g. 4a-1 first, then 4a-2, 4a-3, etc.).
      4. When there are multiple AP parts in a line, go from lowest to
         highest by AP index, from left to right.


-------------------------
Addition of Speaker Label
-------------------------
SYNOPSIS: This allows for a more general speaker normalization which takes
all the speaker segments from the meeting data.


A Speaker field was added to the corpus, which gives the Speaker label for
the DA segment, in the format [mf][en]### (see Meeting Recorder
documentation for more details).


------------------------------
Addition of Utterance ID Field
------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: This new field uniquely identifies each utterance in the corpus.
It's information can be derived from the Start Time, End Time, and
Meeting/Channel Info fields, but we include it explicitly for your
convenience.


An Utterance ID field was added to the corpus so that each utterance in the
database could be identified with a uniquely.  The field is stored in the
following format:

	<Meeting/Channel Info>_<Start Time (in ms)>_<End Time (in ms)>

	e.g. Bdb001-cb_1595340_1599520
	     Bed009-c2_0001990_0002170

Note that the times are always 7 digits, with the appropriate number of
leading and trailing zeroes.  Also note that this field is redundant, and
can be generated from other fields, but we include it in the database for
convenience.


--------------------------------
Addition of Hot Spot Annotations
--------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: The addition of hot spot annotations should not affect previous
work.  It could potentially change scripts that parse the .dadb files,
though, because the number of fields (and order) have changed.


Hot Spot annotations were added to the corpus.  These include a hot spot
label, comments from the hot spot labeling, and the hot spot double star '**'
marking in the transcript field.  See the Hot Spot Annotation Guide for
further details on the hot spot data.  See doc/database-format.txt for
details on where this data is stored, and how it affects the placement of
other data fields.


----------------------------------------------
Addition of Hot Spot Markings in Transcription
----------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: The addition of hot spot markings (the double star '**') may
affect previous work dealing with the Transcription field.  A simple removal
of the '**' marks (e.g. s/\*\* //g in Perl) for that field would cause the
Transcription information to revert back to the previous release.


The hot spot annotations included a marking of the transcription field to
denote where hot spot labels begin and end in the middle of a DA segment.
These are marked as double stars ('**'), and were added to the Transcription
field of the MRDA corpus.

E.g., the Transcription field in previous releases:

the chairs are - chairs are movable .

changes to be:

the chairs are - ** chairs are movable .

See the Hot Spot Annotation Guide for more details.


-------------------------------------
Addition of Hot Spot Reliability Data
-------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: This has no affect on previous work, except that small changes in
the file structure for the reliability data may change file pointers.


We added reliability data (and statistics) for the hot spot annotations and
changed the file structure in the reliability/ directory slightly.  The
additions are reflected in the README file in the reliability/ directory.


-----------------------
Hot Spot Parsing Script
-----------------------
SYNOPSIS: This has no affect on previous work.


We include a hot spot parsing script called map_hs.pl in the scripts
directory.  This script parses and maps hot spots into parts for each
line of the MRDA corpus.


-----------------------------------------------
Splitting Corpus into Data and Transcript Files
-----------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: While this change does not affect the corpus data, it will affect
any scripts that parse or extract data from the .dadb files of previous
releases.


After adding several fields to the corpus data (Speaker, Renumbered AP,
Utterance ID, Hot Spot Annotations) we decided to move the transcript fields
into their own files.  Thus, we now have data (.dadb) and transcript (.trans)
files for each meeting.  The transcript files contain the Original CSV
Transcription and the Transcription fields.  The .dadb files contain the rest
of the fields.  Both files have the Utterance ID field, so they can easily be
merged and individual lines can be matched conveniently.


-------------------
Train/Dev/Test Sets
-------------------
SYNOPSIS: It is recommended that these sets are used so different research
can be directly compared.


We split the 75 meetings in this corpus into training, dev, and test sets for
our experiments.  The splits are described in doc/lists/train_test_split.txt,
included in this release, so that others who wish to use this corpus can also
use these splits, making similar experiments and results comparable.


-------------------------
Data used for experiments
-------------------------
SYNOPSIS: Following steps 1. and 2. will remove the portions of the data that
do not apply for DA research.  Step 3. is a choice that we at ICSI made for
our initial experiments.


When using the data, we suggest:

1.  Ignoring all segments with Error Codes B, D, or Z.
2.  Ignoring all segments with DA label z.
3.  Splitting at the pipe.


-----------------------------------------
Added and revised documentation and files
-----------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS: A new person to the corpus should have access to all the
information in this file in the various other documentation.


The changes described above are documented in various text files in the
release.  Some are new files (e.g. XXXXX) and some are previously existing
files that were revised (e.g. doc/ap-indexing.txt).

The changes above are also reflected in other files (e.g. lists), unless
explicitly noted in documentation.

Examples given in various documentation also reflect the new release data,
unless otherwise noted.
