The classmaps directory contains DA lists and various classmaps.  The file
da_list provides a list of 2083 unique DA labels found in the MRDA corpus.
If the DA labels are split at the pipe bar '|' into two separate labels,
there are 64 labels not found in da_list.  These 64 labels were added to
those in da_list to form another list (called da_list_w_split).

Classmaps are provided as examples of ways in which the large number
of tag types and combinations could be grouped into smaller sets of
classes.  The proposed groupings should be viewed only as suggestions
from the annotators that may be appropriate to certain research
questions.  Note that the maps provided are not motivated by empirical
findings, nor are they the only meaningful maps that could be used.

X is the convention used to indicate that the label should be ignored
in mapping.  Dominance relations and a listing of labels that were
mapped to themselves are also provided for each map.  

The first section below has a general description for each original mapping
and the next section has a more detailed description for those who are
interested.

Overall descriptions of five revised classmaps follow the detailed
description of the original classmaps.  These five classmaps are
revised versions of their original counterparts, where certain DA
labels were reassigned to different classes.  (We recommend using the
revised classmaps over the originals, because we believe they do a
better job of grouping the labels.)  The new classmaps are named with
a "b" at the end of the classmap name, denoting it is a revised version
of the original classmap, e.g. "map_02b" is a revised version of "map_02".

The expanded versions of these revised classmaps are also given, and named
with the suffix "_expanded" appended at the end.  The expanded versions are
obtained by applying the classmaps "top-down" on each unique DA label given
in da_list.  In other words, the first mapping rule that applies to a label
(when looking top-down in the classmap file) is what is used to map the
label.  This is done for each label in the list.

Files in the classmaps/ directory with the suffix "_w_split" include the 64
labels found when splitting at the pipe bar '|'.

Please note that the expanded versions of the original classmaps were
obtained by applying the original classmaps "bottom-up".

Also note that the reliability data included in the reliability/ directory
is based on the original five classmaps, not the revised mappings.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION (Original Classmaps)
----------------------------------------

map_01		This classmap looks at the general tag type of each
		label.

map_02		This classmap is similar to the first classmap except
		that it also preserves the presence of a filler before
		pipe bars.

map_03		This classmap looks at labels with more detail.  Each
		tag is mapped with further specificity as compared to
		the specificity used in the first two classmaps.

map_04		This classmap attempts to compare only a few types
		of labels.	

map_05		This classmap preserves the most detail in the labels out
		of all original classmaps.


-----------------------------------------
DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Original Classmaps)
-----------------------------------------
map_01
		Highest-level grouping symbols used:
		
		D = Disruption (%, %-, %--, x)
		B = Backchannel (b)
		F = Filler (fg, fh, h)
		S = Statement (s & sj)
		Q = Question (qy, qr, qrr...)
		Z = Nonlabeled (z)	
		
		- If there is a pipe bar and a disruption form:
		   - If the left side of the pipe bar is a Filler,
		     then the label is mapped to the S or Q that is
		     present on the right side.
		   - If the left side of the pipe bar is not a Filler,
		     then the label is mapped to D.
		- If there is a pipe bar and no disruption form then
		  there is an order of dominance dictates the mapping.
		  The dominance is S, Q, F.
		- If there is no pipe bar and no disruption form, then
		  the general tag of the label follows the highest-level
		  grouping symbols.
		- If there is no pipe bar and there is a disruption form,
		  then the label is mapped to D.
		- If there is a colon present and there is a disruption
		  form after the colon, then the label is mapped to D.
		  Otherwise, the general tag on the left side of the colon
		  is selected to be mapped to the the highest-level grouping
		  symbol.

		For DAs where are more than one tag, an order of dominance
		is used that was determined subjectively by the annotators.
		The levels of dominance, if there is a pipe bar in the DA,
		are as follows:
		
		1) S, D
		2) Q
		3) F 

		If there is no pipe bar in the DA, the levels of dominance
		are as follows:

		1) D
		2) S, Q, F, B
		3) X

		Given the conventions above, the following labels were
		mapped to identical labels rather than highest-level
		grouping symbols: fh.x|s^rt
				  b|s
				  b|s^e
				  b|s^no



map_02		Similar to map_01 except that pipe bars are included.
		- If there is a pipe bar:
		   - If the left side of the pipe bar is a Filler and
		     the right side is an S or Q form, and if a disruption
		     form is present, then the label is mapped to F|S or
		     F|Q (depending on the type of dialog act after the
		     pipe bar).
		   - Otherwise, the label is mapped to D.
		   - E.g. fh|s.%- ==> F|S
			  fg|qy.%-- ==> F|Q
			  fh|% ==> D
			  s^aap|s.%- ==> D
		- If there is no pipe bar:
		   - If there is a disruption form present:
		       - If the general tag is not a Q, then the label
			 is mapped to a D.
		       - If the general tag is a Q, then the label is
			 mapped to a Q.
		    - If there is no disruption form present, then the
		       label is mapped according to the general tag type.
		    - E.g. s.%- ==> D
			   qy.%- ==> Q
		
		The levels of dominance for DAs that include a pipe bar
		are as follows:

		1) F|S, F|Q
		2) D
		3) S
		4) Q
	
		Without a pipe bar, the levels of dominance are as
		follows:

		1) Q
		2) D
		3) S, B, F
		4) X
		
		Given these conventions, the following labels were
		mapped to identical labels rather than
		grouping symbols: b|s
				  b|s^e
				  b|s^no
				  fh.x|s^rt 



map_03		Same as map_02, except there is further breakdown.

		- fillers further broken down into
			B = Backchannel 
			H - Hold 
			FH = Floor Holder 
			FG = Floor Grabber

		- questions further broken down into
		  	QY = Yes/No Question
			QW = 'Wh-' Question
			QH = Rhetorical Question
			QR = Or Question
			QRR = Or Question following Yes/No Question
	
		- If there is a pipe bar:
		     - If there is a disruption form present:
			  - If the left side of the pipe bar is a Filler
			    and the right side is an S or Q form, then
			    then the label is mapped to the specific
			    filler type, followed by a pipe bar, and
			    then followed by either an S or Q.
			  - Otherwise, the label is mapped to a D.
		     - If there no disruption form present:
			  - If there is no Filler on the left side,
			    then the label is mapped according to the
			    general tag on the left side of the
			    utterance.
			  - If there is a Filler on the left side,
			    then the label is mapped according to the
			    specific filler, followed by a pipe bar,
			    followed by a mapping of the right hand
			    side in accordance to the general tag type
			    on the right hand side of the pipe bar.
		- If there is no pipe bar:
		     - If there is a disruption form present:
			  - Unless the general tag is a Question form,
			    the label is mapped to a D.
			  - If the general tag is a Question form,
			    then the label is mapped according to the
			    Question type.
		     - If there is no disruption form present, then
		       then the general tag of the label is mapped
		       according to the further breakdown listed above.
		
		Given these conventions, the following labels were
		mapped to identical labels rather than
		grouping symbols: b|s
				  b|s^e
				  b|s^no
				  fh.x|s^rt

		The levels of dominance for DAs that include a
		pipe bar are as follows:

		1) FG|Q, FG|S. FH|Q, FH|S
		2) H|S
		3) D
		4) S
		5) B, Q, FH

		Without a pipe bar, the levels of dominance are as
		follows:

		1) D, Q
		2) S, FG, FH, H, B
		3) X, x		



map_04		Only compares Accepts (A), Acknowledgments (K),
		Backchannels (B), Floorgrabbers (F), Checks (C), and
		Rejects (R).  All of these short utterances can use
		the same words, so they interesting for prosodic
		analysis.  All other tags are marked as "other."
		
		Here are the specific details on the mappings:
		
		- If there is a disruption form:
		     - If there is an arp present, then the label
		       follows the rules listed in the section about
		       arp (see below) regardless of the presence of
		       a disruption form.
		     - If there is a % present in the label, the label
		       is mapped to a D.
		     - If the label has a %- or %--, then the label
		       is mapped to O.  However, if there is an fg
		       present with a %--, then the label is mapped to F.
		- If there is no disruption form:
		     - If there is a br tag, then the label is mapped
		       to a C.
		     - If there is a b tag, then the label is mapped
		       to a B.
		     - If there is an fg tag, then the label is
		       mapped to an F.
		     - If there is a bk tag:
			  - If there is no pipe bar and there is no fg
			    (which takes mapping precedence), then the
			    label is mapped to a K.
			  - If there is a pipe bar:
			       - If the bk tag is on the right side
				 of the pipe bar, the label is mapped to
				 a K.
			       - If the bk tag is on the left side
				 of the pipe bar, the label is mapped 
				 to an O.
		     - If the label contains an arp tag:
			  - s^arp and s^arp^bu|qy^bu^d^g^rt are
			    mapped to D.
			  - s^arp|s^cs and s^arp|s^no are
			    mapped to O.
			  - Else, the label is mapped to R.	 
		     - If the label contains a general tag of s:
			  - If the label does not contain specific
			    tags, the label is mapped to S.
			  - If the label contains specific tags:
			       - If the label does not contain an fg,
				 bk, aa, or arp tag, then the
				 label is mapped to an O.  Otherwise,
				 the label follows the rules listed
				 above.

		The levels of dominance for DAs that include a
		pipe bar are as follows:

		1) O
		2) F
		3) K

		Without a pipe bar, the levels of dominance are as
		follows:

		1) O
		2) D
		3) F, B, K, A, R, C
		4) X

		Given these conventions, the following labels were
		mapped to identical labels rather than
		grouping symbols: b|s
				  b|s^e
				  b|s^no
				  fg|qh
				  fg|qh^cs^t^tc
				  fh.x|s^rt
				  fh|qh^co^t
				  fh|qh^cs
				  fh|qh^cs^t
				  fh|qh^rt
				  fh|qh^tc
				  qh:s
				  qo:s
				  qr:s
				  qw:fg
				  qw:s
				  qy:qw
				  qy:qw^rt
				  qy:qy^rt
				  qy:s



map_05		This file is based on the groupings in the manual with the
		exception of 3 groups.  It includes pipe bars but does not 
		include all specific tags.

			  S = Statement
		  	  QY = Y/N Question
		  	  QW = Wh-Question
		  	  QR = Or Question
		  	  QRR = Or-Clause after Y/N Question
		  	  QH = Rhetorical Question
			  QO = Open-Option Question
			  B = Backchannel
			  A = Acceptance
			  R = Rejection
			  U = Uncertain
			  F = Floor Mechanisms
			  AC = Action Motivators
			  C = Check
			  CR = Correction
			  P = Politeness Mechanisms
			  D = Disruption Forms
			  Z = Nonlabeled
		
		- If there is a pipe bar:
		     - If there is no disruption form:
			  - If the left side of the pipe bar is a
			    Filler, then the label is mapped to the
			    specific filler type, a pipe bar, and the
			    mapping that the right hand side takes.
			  - If the right hand side of the pipe bar is
			    a Filler, then the label is mapped by
			    the content on the left hand side of the
			    pipe bar.
		      - If there is a disruption form:
			  - If the disruption form follows a Question
			    then, the label is mapped to a D.
			  - If the disruption form follows a Statement
			    type, then the left and right hand side
			    of the label are both mapped.
		  - If there is no pipe bar:
		       - If there is no disruption form:
			  - The entire label is mapped.
		       - If there is a disruption form:
			  - The label is mapped to D.
		  - If there is a colon:
		       - The label is mapped according to the DA on
			 the left side of the colon.
		       - If there is a disruption form:
			    - If the disruption form is present only
			      on one side of the colon, it is ignored
			      for mapping.
			    - If the disruption form is on both sides
			      of the colon, the label is mapped to D.
		  - Individual tags are mapped as follows:
		    AC: cs, co, and cc
		    A: aap, aa, na
		    B: b, bk, br
		    C: bu
		    CR: bsc, bc, bu
		    P: ft, bd, fa
		    R: ar, nd, ng
		    U: am, no

		The levels of dominance for DAs that include a
		pipe bar are as follows:

		1) F|S, F|QY, F|QO, F|QR, F|QW
		2) D
		3) AC, A, P, R, C, U, CR, (B)
		4) S
		5) QH, QO, QR, QRR, QW, QY
		6) (B)

		Note: "B" is in parentheses because "B" has greater
		      dominance than S when "bk" is being mapped but
		      "B" has lower dominance when "b" is being
		      mapped.

		Without a pipe bar, the levels of dominance are as
		follows:

		1) D
		2) B, F, QH, QO, QR, QRR, QW, QY
		3) U, AC, C, A, P, R, CR, B
		4) S, X

		Given these conventions, the following labels were
		mapped to identical labels rather than
		grouping symbols: b|s
				  b|s^e
				  b|s^no
				  fg|qh
				  fg|qh^cs^t^tc
				  fh.x|s^rt
				  fh|qh
				  fh|qh^co^t

---------------------------------------
OVERALL DESCRIPTION (Revised Classmaps)
---------------------------------------
map_01b		This classmap looks at the general tag of each label.
		Any label containing a disruption will be mapped to
		D (disruption).  Labels containing pipe bars will first
		be mapped to S (statement) if a statement is present on
		either side and then mapped to Q (question) if a question
		is present on either side and a statement is not.  Floor
		mechanisms (F) are mapped on remaining utterances after
		statements and questions have been mapped, regardless of
		the presence of a pipe bar.

map_02b		This classmap is similar to map_01b except that it
		indicates the presence of labels before and after pipe
		bars and it maps labels containing disruptions to D only
		after the mappings to floor mechanisms, statements,
		questions, and backchannels have been exhausted.  Labels
		containing pipe bars will have the label to the left of
		the pipe bar mapped to F, S, or Q accordingly and the
		label to the right mapped to S or Q accordingly.  Labels
		containing disruptions will first be mapped to F, S, Q, or
		B, if the appropriate DAs are present, otherwise they will
		be mapped to D.

map_03b		This classmap looks at labels with more detail.  Each tag
		is mapped with further specificity as compared to the
		specificity used in map_01b and map_02b.  This
		classmap behaves in much the same manner as classmap 02 by
		indicating the presence of labels before and after pipe
		bars.  This classmap also maps labels containing
		disruptions to D only after the mappings to floor
		mechanisms, statements, questions, and backchannels have
		been exhausted.  When mapping floor mechanisms, this
		classmap indicates the type of floor mechanism (e.g., FG,
		FH, or H).  This classmap also indicates the type of
		question in its mappings (e.g., QY, QW, QRR, QR, QO, or QH).

map_04b		This classmap attempts to compare only a few types of
		labels.  Unlike the previous three classmaps, this classmap
		does not map statements and questions.  Rather, labels
		containing "accepts" (<aa>, <aap>, and <na>) are mapped
		to A, labels containing "rejects" (<ar>, <arp>, <nd>, and
		<ng>) are mapped to R, labels containing "acknowledgements"
		(<bk>, <ba>, and <bh>) are mapped to K, and labels
		containing "checks" (<br>, <f>, and <bu>) are mapped to C.
		Floor mechanisms, backchannels, and disruptions are mapped
		in the usual manner.  All other labels that do not meet
		these criteria are mapped to O (other).  Additionally, the
		presence of labels before and after pipe bars is indicated.
		When a pipe bar is present, the mapping hierarchy is as
		follows:  Labels will first be mapped to F, A, R, K, and C
		(where F takes precedence over A, A over R, and so on).
		Then, all labels containing disruptions immediately to the
		right of a pipe bar are mapped to D.  All other labels are
		mapped to O.  If a pipe bar is not present, the mapping
		hierarchy is as follows:  Labels will first be mapped to A,
		R, K, C, B, F, D, X, and O (where A takes precedence over
		R, R over K, and so on).

map_05b		This classmap preserves the most detail in the labels out
		of all the classmaps.  This classmap also indicates the
		presence of labels before and after pipe bars.  In this
		classmap, the following mappings are present:

		      floor mechanisms - F
		           fg, fh, h
		      rejects - R
		           ar, arp, nd, ng
		      action motivators - AC
		           cs, co, cc
		      checks - C
		           br, f, bu
		      corrections - CR
		           bc, bsc
		      politeness mechanisms - P
		           ft, bd, fa, by, fw
		      uncertain responses - U
		           am, no
		      backchannels - B
		           b, bk
		      statements - S
		           s
		      questions - QY, QW, QRR, QR, QO, QH
		           qy, qw, qrr, qr, qo, qh
		      disruptions - D
		           %, %-, %--
		      nonspeech - X
		           x
		      nonlabeled - Z
		           z

		When a pipe bar is present, the mapping hierarchy is as
		follows:  Labels will first be mapped to F, A, R, AC, C,
		CR, P, U, B, S, QY, QW, QRR, QR, QO, and QH (where a F
		takes precedence over A, A over R, and so on).  All
		labels containing disruptions immediately to the right of
		a pipe bar are mapped to D or X.  If a pipe bar is not
		present, the mapping hierarchy is as follows:  Labels will
		first be mapped to F, A, R, AC, C, CR, P, U, B (only for
		<bk>, S, QY, QW, QRR, QR, QO, QH, B (for <b>), D, X, and Z
		(where F takes precedence over A, A over R, and so on).
