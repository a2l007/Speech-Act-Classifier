1200.89,1203.02,Bmr024-c9,fg|qy^rt,1a,,,so | did they actually save the far-field data ?
1203.02,1205.38,Bmr024-c9,s.%-,,,,cuz at first they weren't - they weren't sa- ==
1203.29,1204.67,Bmr024-c5,s,1b,,,well this was - this was the question .
1203.41,1203.84,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yes .
1203.54,1203.86,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1204.67,1206.57,Bmr024-c5,s,1b+2a,,,so - so they were saying they were not going to .
1205.2,1205.33,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1205.38,1205.71,Bmr024-c9,b,,,,o_k .
1206.57,1212.99,Bmr024-c5,s,1b++.2a+,,,and i said well that's silly if - if we're gonna try to do it for a corpus there might be people who are interested in acoustics .
1207.51,1207.91,Bmr024-c9,b,,,,yeah .
1209.47,1209.7,Bmr024-cB,s^fe.%,,,,wow !
1210.13,1210.3,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,no .

1212.96,1215.38,Bmr024-c4,s^nd,2b,,,projector we were not saying we are not doing it .
1213.17,1213.49,Bmr024-c9,b,,,,yeah .
1214.1,1214.27,Bmr024-c3,%-,,,,s- ==
1215.12,1218.6,Bmr024-cB,qr^d,3a,,,no the - the question is do we save one or two far-field channels or all of them ?
1215.38,1216.46,Bmr024-c4,s.%--,,,,we wer- - we just wanted to do ==
1215.73,1215.94,Bmr024-c9,b,,,,right .
1217.6,1217.72,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1218.73,1218.8,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1218.95,1220.65,Bmr024-c5,s,3b,,,i - i see no reason not to do all of them .
1220.76,1227.3,Bmr024-c5,s,3b+,,,that - that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies uh it's nice to have the same for every recording .
1220.99,1221.17,Bmr024-c3,fg,,,,um ==
1221.22,1221.53,Bmr024-c9,%,,,,nnn .

1227.56,1229.51,Bmr024-c3,qw^rt,4a,,,so what is the purpose of this recording ?
1227.88,1228.22,Bmr024-cB,b.%,,,,mm-hmm .
1230.36,1236.95,Bmr024-c3,s^bu^m,5b.6a,,,this is to get acoustic and language model training data for smartkom .
1230.49,1234.87,Bmr024-cB,s,4b.5a,,,it's to be traini- - to b- - training data and development data for the smartkom system .
1232.35,1233.07,Bmr024-c4,qy^d^rt,,,,the english system ?
1235.35,1235.57,Bmr024-cB,s^aa,6b,,,yeah .
1235.84,1235.91,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .

1237.74,1238.39,Bmr024-c1,qw.%--,,,,where does this ?==
1237.77,1240.39,Bmr024-c9,s^cs,8a,,,maybe we can have him vary the microphones too .
1240.14,1240.6,Bmr024-c3,fg,,,,well ==
1240.39,1241.86,Bmr024-c9,s,8a+,r,,or they're different s- - speakers .

1241.06,1241.2,Bmr024-c5,fg,,,,right .
1241.2,1243.48,Bmr024-c5,fg|s,8b.9a,,,so - so - so | for their usage they don't need anything .
1241.94,1242.58,Bmr024-c3,qw.%-,,,,so why not ?==
1243.79,1243.89,Bmr024-c4,fg,,,,yeah .
1243.89,1244.16,Bmr024-c5,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
1243.89,1246.9,Bmr024-c4,s^ng,9b.10a,,,but - but i'm not sure about the legal aspect of - of that .
1246.9,1250.25,Bmr024-c4,qy,10a+,,,is - is there some contract with smartkom or something about the data ?
1248.51,1248.8,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1250.25,1251.35,Bmr024-c4,qw.%--,,,,what they ?==
1251.35,1253.86,Bmr024-c4,qy,10a++,,,or is - is that our data which we are collecting here ?
1253.35,1257.05,Bmr024-c3,s,10b-1.11a,,,we've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did .
1253.86,1254.15,Bmr024-c4,qrr.%--,,,,or ?==
1254.66,1255.02,Bmr024-c4,s^bk,11b,,,o_k .
1256.34,1256.63,Bmr024-c4,s^bk,11b+,,,o_k .
1256.39,1258.01,Bmr024-cB,s,10b-2.12a,,,we weren't supposed to collect any data .
1256.89,1257.09,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,so ==
1258.19,1258.51,Bmr024-c4,fg,,,,o_k .
1258.7,1259.43,Bmr024-cB,s.%-,,,,this was all ==
1258.8,1259.08,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1259.08,1260.99,Bmr024-c4,fg|s,12b.13a,r,,so | yeah th- - th- - that was the question .
1260.99,1261.49,Bmr024-c4,%--,,,,if - if ==
1261.67,1261.84,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1261.73,1261.93,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1262.51,1262.83,Bmr024-c4,s,12b+.13a+,,,basically .
1262.52,1263.49,Bmr024-c3,s,13b,,,no that's not a problem .
1263.49,1273.94,Bmr024-c3,s^co,13b+.14a,,,i - l- - look it seems to me that if we're doing it anyway and we're doing it for these - these purposes that we have and we have these distant mikes we definitely should re- - should save it all as long as we've got disk space .
1268.93,1269.16,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1273.94,1274.89,Bmr024-c3,s,13b++.14a+,,,and disk is pretty cheap .
1274.17,1274.43,Bmr024-cB,s^bk,14b,,,o_k .
1274.89,1275.62,Bmr024-c3,qy,,,,so should we save it ?
1275.16,1275.5,Bmr024-c5,%-,,,,and then ==
1276.06,1276.29,Bmr024-c3,%--,,,,now th- ==
1276.29,1276.52,Bmr024-c3,s^aa,,,,yeah .
1277.01,1279.44,Bmr024-c3,s,15a,,,so we save it because it's - it - it's potentially useful .
1279.5,1279.7,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,15b,,,right .
1279.92,1282.85,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,and now what do we do with it is - is a s- - separate question .
1283.03,1288.37,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,i mean anybody who's training something up could choose to put it - eh to u- - include this or not .
1286.36,1286.7,Bmr024-cB,b.%,,,,right .
1288.37,1290.44,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,i - i would not say it was part of the meetings corpus .
1290.44,1290.81,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,it isn't .
1291.73,1292.98,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,but it's some other data we have .
1292.98,1296.76,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can .
1296.71,1296.97,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1296.76,1296.87,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^g,,,,right ?
1297.33,1303.95,Bmr024-c5,fg|s,,,,so | it's - it - it - i guess it - the - begs the question of what is the meeting corpus .
1304.09,1311.68,Bmr024-c5,qy^rt,16a,r-,,so if at u_w they start recording two-person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ?
1309,1315.43,Bmr024-c3,s,16b.17a,,,i think it's - i - i think - i th- - think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key .
1316.26,1318.36,Bmr024-c5,s,17b.18a,10=l=d.a,,well this has two or more people conversing with each other .
1317.5,1318.3,Bmr024-c3,fg,,,,nnn well ==
1318.01,1318.2,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1318.36,1319.42,Bmr024-c5,s,17b+.18a+,,,they're just not face to face .
1318.38,1321.92,Bmr024-c9,qw^cs,19a,,,what if we just give it a - a name like we give these meetings a name ?
1318.69,1319,Bmr024-c0,%-,,,,well this ==
1319.01,1319.91,Bmr024-c3,s^ar,18b,b,,no it doesn't .
1319.91,1320.15,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^g^rt,,c,,right ?
1320.15,1320.79,Bmr024-c3,%--,,,,it has ==
1321.61,1322.7,Bmr024-c5,s^na,19b,r,,i mean that was my intention .
1322.31,1325.97,Bmr024-c9,s,19a+,,,and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't .
1325.55,1326.05,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1325.65,1326.45,Bmr024-c5,s^na^r,19b+,,,that was my intention .
1325.72,1326,Bmr024-c0,%-,,,,well this ==
1325.97,1326.2,Bmr024-c9,fh,,,,and ==
1326.44,1333.27,Bmr024-c5,fg|qr,,,,so - so - s- - so | part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in ?
1326.46,1329,Bmr024-c9,s^cs,,r,,just give it a title .
1333.01,1333.35,Bmr024-c0,b,,,,oh .
1333.63,1334.51,Bmr024-c3,s.%-,,,,i think it is a s- ==
1333.78,1342.81,Bmr024-c5,qr^d^rt,20a,,,we- - give everyone who's involved as their own user i_d give it session i_ds let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it or do we wanna special case it ?
1342.81,1345.93,Bmr024-c5,qw,20a+,,,and if we were gonna special case it who's gonna do that ?
1344.82,1351.66,Bmr024-cB,s,20b,,,well it - it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily .
1345.14,1345.33,Bmr024-c4,fg,,,,so ==
1345.33,1346.15,Bmr024-c4,%-,,,,it - it - it ==
1346.13,1346.41,Bmr024-c0,s.%-,,,,i think ==
1351.66,1355.74,Bmr024-cB,s^cs,20b+.21a,,,but as far as distributing it we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus .
1355.74,1357.94,Bmr024-cB,s^cs.%-,,,,we should let it be its own corp- ==
1356.1,1356.35,Bmr024-c3,s^aa,21b-1,,,yeah .
1357.37,1358.15,Bmr024-c5,s^na,21b-2,,,i don't see why not .
1357.57,1358.69,Bmr024-c0,%-,,,,well it's - it - well because ==
1358.15,1359.28,Bmr024-c5,s,21b-2+,,,it's just a different topic .
1359.13,1361.82,Bmr024-c0,s,,,,i ha- - i have an extra point which is the naturalness issue .
1362.39,1364.47,Bmr024-c0,s,,,,because we have like meetings that have a reason .
1364.47,1366.64,Bmr024-c0,s,,,,that's one of the reasons that we were talking about this .
1366.64,1370.06,Bmr024-c0,s,22a,,,and - and those - and this sounds like it's more of an experimental setup .
1366.69,1367.04,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1369.6,1375.05,Bmr024-c3,s,22b,,,it's scenario-based it's - it's human-computer interface it's really pretty different .
1370.06,1370.9,Bmr024-c0,s,,,,it's got a different purpose .
1375.05,1379.39,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,but i- - i - i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they're gonna do .
1375.14,1375.39,Bmr024-c0,b,,,,yeah .
1379.39,1382.89,Bmr024-c3,s,23a,,,but i don't think i- - it - it doesn't match anything that we've described about meetings .
1382.27,1382.57,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1383.25,1387,Bmr024-c3,s,23a+,,,whereas everything that we talked about them doing at - at u_w and so forth really does .
1386.91,1387.11,Bmr024-c5,fg,,,,o_k .
1387.03,1387.83,Bmr024-c3,s.%-,,,,they're actually talking ==
1387.11,1390.22,Bmr024-c5,qw,23b.24a,,,so w- - so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ?
1388.76,1388.82,Bmr024-c0,b,,,,hmm .
1390.38,1390.52,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1391.04,1391.86,Bmr024-c3,s.%--,,,,you can - you can ==
1391.86,1398.95,Bmr024-c3,s^bs,24b.25a,,,again as - as i think andreas was saying if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions there's no problem with that .
1398.95,1402.29,Bmr024-c3,s.%--,24b+.25a+,,,it's just that it's you know different directory it's called something different it's ==
1402.29,1402.51,Bmr024-c3,fh,24b+.25a+,,,you know ==
1402.9,1403.52,Bmr024-c3,s,24b++.25a++,,,it is different .
1403.93,1405.18,Bmr024-c3,s.%--,24b+++.25a+++,,,you can't just fold it in as if it's ==
1405.18,1406.23,Bmr024-c3,s,24b++++.25a++++,,,i mean digits are different too .
1406.23,1406.42,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
1406.37,1408.1,Bmr024-cB,s,25b-1,,,it might also be potentially confusing .
1406.72,1408.06,Bmr024-c5,s,25b-2,,,yeah but those are folded in .
1408.06,1410.26,Bmr024-c5,s,25b-2+,,,and it's just - you just mark the transcripts differently .
1410.26,1412.34,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,,,,so - so one option is you fold it in .
1410.51,1410.61,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,right .
1412.71,1419.75,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,,,,and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction .
1417.46,1417.87,Bmr024-cB,%-,,,,yeah i th- ==
1419.28,1422.43,Bmr024-c3,s,26a,,,well i don- - i wouldn't call reading digits meetings .
1423.16,1423.5,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,,right ?
1423.5,1424.83,Bmr024-c3,s.%-,,,,i mean we - we - we were doing ==
1424.34,1427.23,Bmr024-c5,fg|s^df,26b,,,well but - but | i put it under the same directory tree .
1427.23,1429.63,Bmr024-c5,fh|s^e,,,,you know | it's in user doctor speech data m_r .
1427.3,1427.58,Bmr024-c3,fg,,,,well ==
1427.88,1430.71,Bmr024-c9,qy^cs,27a,20=l=a.a,,can we just have a directory called like other stuff ?
1431.04,1431.4,Bmr024-c9,fh,,,,and ==
1431.32,1431.72,Bmr024-c5,s^j,27b-2,b,,other .
1431.88,1432.8,Bmr024-c9,fh|s,,,,well - | or i - dunno .
1433.03,1434.93,Bmr024-c3,s,27b-1,b,,i mean i don't care what directory tree you have it under .
1433.88,1436.94,Bmr024-c9,s^cs,27a+,c,,and - and just um store it there .
1434.99,1435.21,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^g,,,,right ?
1435.21,1435.85,Bmr024-c3,s.%-,,,,i mean that's just a ==
1435.8,1435.93,Bmr024-c5,fg,,,,o_k .
1435.93,1441.12,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,,,,my preference is to have a single procedure so that i don't have to think too much about things .
1436.1,1436.23,Bmr024-cB,b.%,,,,yes .
1436.94,1437.14,Bmr024-c9,fh,,,,i mean ==
1441.39,1442.7,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,,,,and just have a marking .
1441.45,1441.64,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1443.59,1448.05,Bmr024-c5,s,28a,,,if we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure and someone has to do that .
1443.66,1449.69,Bmr024-c3,s^co,28b.29a,,,o_- - you - you can use whatever procedure you want that's p- - convenient for you .
1449.69,1453.48,Bmr024-c3,s^co,28b+.29a+,,,all i'm saying is that there's no way that we're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings .
1454.05,1454.24,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,29b,,,right .
1454.1,1458.92,Bmr024-c3,s^co,28b++,,,and similarly we're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings .
1459.45,1460.19,Bmr024-c3,s,28b+++,,,those aren't meetings .
1460.51,1465.42,Bmr024-c3,s^cs,28b++++,,,but if it makes it easier for you to pu- - fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree knock yourself out .
1465.62,1465.74,Bmr024-c3,qy^d^g,,,,you know ?
1465.68,1467.81,Bmr024-c1,s,,,,there's a couple other questions that i have too .
1467.81,1471.32,Bmr024-c1,qw,,,,and - and one of them is what about uh consent issues ?
1471.89,1473.45,Bmr024-c1,qw,30a,,,and the other one is what about transcription ?
1473.79,1475.02,Bmr024-c4,s,30b.31a,,,transcription is done in munich .
1473.87,1474.08,Bmr024-c1,%--,,,,are ?==
1475.5,1475.73,Bmr024-c1,s^bk,31b,,,o_k .
1475.73,1477.51,Bmr024-c1,qy^bu^d,31b+.32a,,,so we don't have to worry about transcribing it ?
1476.64,1476.75,Bmr024-c4,s^aa,32b-1,,,yeah .
1477.04,1477.34,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,alright .
1477.14,1479.5,Bmr024-c5,s,32b-2,,,so w- - we will hafta worry about format .
1478.34,1480.57,Bmr024-cB,s,33a,,,that's a that's - another argument to keep it separate .
1480.57,1486.65,Bmr024-cB,s^df,33a+,,,because it's gonna follow the smartkom transcription conventions and not the icsi meeting transcription conventions .
1482.96,1483.48,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,33b-1,,,oh o_k .
1483.41,1483.57,Bmr024-c4,b,,,,yeah .

1486.1,1486.47,Bmr024-c3,s^ba,33b-2,,,good point .
1486.81,1487.62,Bmr024-c5,%--,,,,that's - that's a ==
1488.28,1488.68,Bmr024-c3,s^ba^r,33b-2,,,good point .
1489.45,1494.31,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,but i'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or - or some things .
1495.29,1495.58,Bmr024-c3,fh,,,,um .
1496.28,1504.17,Bmr024-c3,qy^rt,34a,,,do we h- - do we have uh um american-born folk uh reading german - german uh pla- - uh place names and so forth ?
1503.9,1504.07,Bmr024-c4,s^aa,34b-1.35a,,,yeah .
1504.17,1504.44,Bmr024-c3,qy.%-,,,,is that ?==
1504.17,1504.67,Bmr024-cB,s^aa,34b-2,,,exactly .
1504.8,1504.94,Bmr024-c5,s^aa,34b-3,,,yep .
1504.82,1504.95,Bmr024-c4,s^aa^r,34b-1+,,,yeah .
1505.04,1505.5,Bmr024-c3,s^ba,35b,,,yeah great .
1505.05,1505.23,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1506.11,1507.52,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,they - they even have a reading list .
1507.11,1508.02,Bmr024-c1,s,,,,i bet that sounds good .
1507.61,1508.23,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,it's pretty funny .
1507.78,1508.16,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1508.02,1508.19,Bmr024-c1,qy^d^g,,,,huh ?
1508.09,1508.32,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1509.17,1510.02,Bmr024-c4,s^cs^t3,,,,you can do that if you want .
1510.49,1510.76,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1510.71,1511.04,Bmr024-c1,b,,,,o_k .
1511.84,1512,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1511.85,1512.62,Bmr024-c1,s^no^t3,,,,i dunno if you want that .
1511.97,1512.29,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,right .
1513.44,1513.96,Bmr024-c5,fg,,,,so ==
1513.84,1513.99,Bmr024-c0,b,,,,hmm .
1513.88,1514.84,Bmr024-c3,s,36a,,,heidelberg .
1516.91,1517.16,Bmr024-cB,s^t3,,,,exactly .
1518.3,1526.81,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,38a,,,disk might eventually be an issue so we might - we - we might need to uh get some more disk pretty soon .
1518.9,1519.7,Bmr024-cB,qy^t3,36b.37a,30=l=o.a,,do you wanna be a subject ?
1521.71,1522.57,Bmr024-c3,s^j^t3,37b,b.c,,yeah i be pretty good .
1525.55,1525.71,Bmr024-cB,%--,,,,we ==
1525.97,1526.4,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1526.81,1530.8,Bmr024-c5,s,39a,,,we're about - we're about half - halfway through our disk right now .
1527.45,1528.68,Bmr024-cB,s^na,38b,,,that was one of our concerns .
1527.55,1527.92,Bmr024-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1531.05,1531.78,Bmr024-c1,qy^bu^rt,39b,,,are we only half ?
1531.78,1532.76,Bmr024-c1,s^arp,39b+.40a,,,i thought we were more than that .
1532.56,1536,Bmr024-c5,s^na,40b,,,we're probably a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on .
1537.14,1542.94,Bmr024-c5,fh|s^na,40b+,,,so | once everything gets converted over to the disks we're supposed to be using we'll be probably uh seventy-five percent .
1543.21,1550.63,Bmr024-c1,s,41a,,,well when i was looking for space for thilo i found one disk that had uh - i think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen .
1550.68,1550.87,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,41b,,,yep .
1551.84,1553.58,Bmr024-c1,s,,,,and everything else was sorta committed .
1554.15,1554.49,Bmr024-c1,fh,,,,uh .
1554.6,1557.02,Bmr024-c5,qr,42a,,,were those backed-up or non-backed-up ?
1557.5,1558.99,Bmr024-c1,s,42b-1.43a,,,those were non-backed-up .
1558.01,1558.91,Bmr024-c4,s,42b-2,,,non-back-up .
1558.83,1559.07,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,43b,,,right .
1559.07,1559.75,Bmr024-c5,s,44a,,,so that's different .
1560.95,1561.08,Bmr024-c1,%--,,,,s- ==
1561.08,1562.06,Bmr024-c1,s^bu,44b,,,oh you're talking about backed-up .
1561.96,1563.8,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,i'm much more concerned about the backed-up .
1564.11,1564.94,Bmr024-c5,s^bsc,,,,{@reject@} the non-backed-up .
1564.63,1566.15,Bmr024-c1,s,45a,,,i haven't looked to see how much of that we have .
1565.64,1566.04,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,yeah .
1566.04,1566.89,Bmr024-c5,s,45b,,,i- - is cheap .
1566.89,1570.58,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,,,,i mean if we need to we can buy a disk hang it off a s- - uh workstation .
1570.58,1573,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,if it's not backed-up the sysadmins don't care too much .
1573.21,1573.41,Bmr024-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1573.41,1576.87,Bmr024-c3,fg|s.%--,,,,so i mean | pretty much anytime we need a disk we can get it at the rate that we're ==
1575.72,1576.13,Bmr024-cB,%--,,,,you can ==
1578.34,1586.36,Bmr024-cB,s^cs,46a,40=w-=a;g.a,,i shouldn't be saying this but you can just - you know since the back-ups are every night you can recycle the backed-up diskspace .
1585.89,1586.33,Bmr024-c5,fg,,,,yeah .
1586.33,1588.33,Bmr024-c5,s^nd,46b-1,,,but that's - that's - that's risky .
1589.61,1590.51,Bmr024-c3,s^j^na.%--,46b-2.47a,b,,yeah you really shouldn't be saying ==
1589.97,1590.28,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,mmm .
1590.23,1590.92,Bmr024-cB,s^j,47b.48a,b-,,i didn't say that .
1590.28,1590.68,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,mmm .
1591.02,1591.82,Bmr024-c5,s^bk,48b,b,,{@reject@} yeah that's right .
1591.12,1591.69,Bmr024-cB,s^r.%,,,,i didn't say that .
1591.82,1592.6,Bmr024-c5,s^co,48b+,b,,beep that out .
1592.87,1597.28,Bmr024-c3,s,,b**b.c,,da- - we had allowed dave to listen to these - ** these uh recordings .
1594.86,1595.08,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,right .
1597.28,1598.68,Bmr024-c3,fh,,,,um - yeah .
1598.68,1603.09,Bmr024-c3,s^tc,49a,,,i me- - and - there's been this conversation going on about getting another file server .
1603.09,1604.67,Bmr024-c3,s^co,49a+,,,and - and we can do that .
1603.17,1603.45,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1604.67,1609.01,Bmr024-c3,s^co,49a++,,,we'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of - of disk i guess .
1607.89,1608.13,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,yeah .
1609.54,1619.2,Bmr024-cB,s^cs,49b-1,,,well i think - i think there's an argument for having - you know you could use our old file server for - for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed .
1610.03,1612.49,Bmr024-c5,s^nd,49b-2,,,it's really the back-up issue rather than the file server issue .
1619.2,1625.39,Bmr024-cB,s^cs,49b-1+,,,and then have a fast new file server for data that is um heavily accessed .
1622.77,1622.93,Bmr024-c5,b,,,,yeah .
1624.82,1627.19,Bmr024-c5,s^r,50a,,,my understanding is the issue isn't really the file server .
1625.59,1625.83,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1627.2,1629.03,Bmr024-c5,s^cs,50a+,,,we could always put more disks on .
1627.27,1627.62,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1628.19,1629.65,Bmr024-cB,s^na.%--,50b-1,,,it's the back- - it's the back-up capaci- ==
1629.03,1630.01,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,it's the back-up system .
1629.91,1630.14,Bmr024-cB,b,,,,yeah .
1630.96,1631.02,Bmr024-c5,fh,,,,so ==
1631.02,1633.07,Bmr024-c5,s,,,,which is near saturation apparently .
1634.51,1634.76,Bmr024-c5,fh,,,,so ==
1635.08,1635.46,Bmr024-c3,s,,,,soon .
1635.11,1641.38,Bmr024-c1,s^nd,50b-2.51a,,,i think - i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines .
1641.38,1648.12,Bmr024-c1,s,,,,and we've got you know fifty machines trying to access data off of abbott at once .
1647.55,1648.51,Bmr024-c5,s^aap,51b,,,well we're alright for now .
1648.51,1649.9,Bmr024-c5,s^df,51b+,,,because the network's so slow .
1650.67,1655.28,Bmr024-cB,s,52a,,,i mean i think - i think we've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it .
1655.28,1655.76,Bmr024-cB,%--,,,,but the ==
1656.27,1660.58,Bmr024-cB,qw^cs,,,,what about putting the stuff on like c_- - c_d-rom or d_v_d or something ?

1658.47,1658.95,Bmr024-c5,s^na,52b,,,that was me .
1660.14,1661.88,Bmr024-c5,s,52b+.53a,,,i was the one who said it was not reliable .
1661.65,1662,Bmr024-cB,s^bk,53b,,,o_k .
1661.88,1663.08,Bmr024-c5,s,54a,,,the- - they - they wear out .
1663.68,1664.03,Bmr024-cB,s^bk,54b,,,oh o_k .
1664.26,1664.43,Bmr024-c5,fh,,,,yeah .

1666.86,1667.35,Bmr024-c5,s^aa,55b+,,,absolutely .
1667.01,1668.63,Bmr024-cB,qrr,56a,,,or from being read and read ?
1668.03,1668.18,Bmr024-c5,s^ar,56b.57a,,,no .
1668.89,1671.01,Bmr024-c5,s^nd,56b+.57a+,,,read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them .
1669.82,1670.32,Bmr024-cB,s^bk,57b,,,oh o_k .
1671.6,1675.05,Bmr024-c5,s,58a,,,but the r- - the write once and the read-writes don't last .
1676.4,1680.95,Bmr024-c5,s^co,,,,so you don't wa- - you don't wanna put ir- - un- - reproduceable data on them .

1764.61,1768.23,Bmr024-cB,s,,,,say they actually last like five years huh in - in the typical case .
