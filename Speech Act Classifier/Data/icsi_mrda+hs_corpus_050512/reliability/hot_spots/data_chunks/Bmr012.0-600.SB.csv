52.981,54.281,Bmr012-c0,z,4a,,,basically it wasn't adapting anything .
54.804,55.104,Bmr012-c3,z,4b,,,oh .
56.634,57.964,Bmr012-c4,z,,,,so about like i'm wearing it now .

58.794,60.514,Bmr012-c3,z,5a,,,so why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted ?
60.088,61.128,Bmr012-cB,z,,,,it's not always possible .
60.2,62.8,Bmr012-c4,z,,,,so- - so jane you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth .

64.245,69.155,Bmr012-c0,z,7b.10a,,,oh because when it estimates the transformer pro- - produces like a single matrix or something .
64.829,65.059,Bmr012-c4,z,8b.9a,,,yep .
65.283,65.433,Bmr012-c8,z,,,,is that {@reject@} ?==

94.871,99.781,Bmr012-c4,fh|s^t,,,,um - | everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are .
94.98,95.58,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,o_k .
100.111,104.561,Bmr012-c4,s^co,,,,um - we - we're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea- - fill out the speaker form once .
104.561,105.831,Bmr012-c4,s^co,,,,but everyone does need to do it .
106.471,109.671,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and so that's the name sex email et cetera .
109.635,110.235,Bmr012-cB,b.%,,,,mm-hmm .
110.471,114.071,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,we - we had a lot of discussion about the variety of english and so on .
114.071,116.821,Bmr012-c4,s^co,,,,so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank .
117.261,122.261,Bmr012-c4,fh|s,21a,,,um - | i - i designed the form and i don't know what to put for my own region .
122.711,122.921,Bmr012-c4,fh,,,,so ==
122.824,123.364,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mmm .
123.504,123.994,Bmr012-c3,s^cs,21b-1.22a,,,california .
124.228,124.578,Bmr012-c0,s.%--,,,,i think ==
124.285,124.885,Bmr012-c4,s^bk^m,22b,,,california .
124.459,124.979,Bmr012-cB,s^cs,21b-2,,,california .
125.038,126.578,Bmr012-c0,qy^cs,23a,,,um - may i make one suggestion ?
126.578,128.988,Bmr012-c0,s^cs,24a,,,instead of age put date of - uh - year of birth .
126.741,126.971,Bmr012-c4,s^aa,23b,,,sure .
129.188,134.706,Bmr012-c0,s^df,24a+,20=h-=a;dc.a,,because age will change but the year of birth changes - you know - stays the same usually .
132.127,132.357,Bmr012-c4,s^bk,24b-1,,,oh .
136.63,137.18,Bmr012-c4,qy^bu^d^rt,24b-1+,,,birth year ?
136.666,138.076,Bmr012-c2,s^cs,,b,,a- - actually wait a minute .
136.675,137.355,Bmr012-c8,s.%-,,,,although on ==
137.84,138.34,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,yeah .
138.076,139.386,Bmr012-c2,qy,,b,,shouldn't it be the other way around ?
138.12,138.59,Bmr012-c3,s^j,24b-2,b-,,not for me .
139.297,143.777,Bmr012-c8,s^cs.%-,25a,,,course on the other - on the other hand you could - you view it as the age at the time of the ==
140.432,141.082,Bmr012-c2,s,,b.e,,on the other side .
141.482,141.862,Bmr012-c2,b,,,,yeah .
141.612,145.422,Bmr012-c0,s^nd.%-,25b.26a,30=w+=d.a,,well the thing is if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that ==
144.598,148.408,Bmr012-c8,fg|s^df^nd.%-,26b.27a,b.e,,yes | but what we care about is the age at - at the recording date rather than the ==
146.076,147.436,Bmr012-c3,s^nd,27b-1,,,but there's no other date on the form .
146.471,147.191,Bmr012-c2,b,,b-,,o- - yeah .
147.191,149.811,Bmr012-c2,s^j,28a,40=w-=a.a.b,FBH,w- - we don't care how they - old they really are .
147.813,150.673,Bmr012-c0,s^nd,27b-2,,,well - well i don't know .
148.958,151.138,Bmr012-c8,s^aa|s^j,28b,b.e,,yes | unless we wanna send them a card .
152.48,155.47,Bmr012-c4,s,29a,50=w0=a;d.a,,well i guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .
156.861,157.381,Bmr012-c8,s^aa,29b,,,yeah that's true .
157.022,157.292,Bmr012-c0,s^t1,,,,anyway .
158.22,159.66,Bmr012-c2,s,,b.e,,i still don't see the problem .
158.806,159.316,Bmr012-c4,%--,,,,either way ==
159.956,161.916,Bmr012-c4,fh|s,,,,yeah | i think - i think age is alright .
161.916,171.087,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and then um - there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh - so that you'll be able to extract the date off that .
162.083,162.443,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,o_k .
168.722,169.132,Bmr012-c0,%,,,,mm-hmm .
172.273,173.083,Bmr012-c4,fh,,,,so anyway .
173.663,180.493,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time the speaker form only once the digit form every time .
180.493,184.773,Bmr012-c4,s^co,,,,even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting .
186.667,186.867,Bmr012-c4,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,,o_k ?
186.867,190.997,Bmr012-c4,s^co,,,,and then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form .
192.217,194.777,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and that should just be one person whose name i don't know .
197.649,197.839,Bmr012-c4,qy^d^f^g,,,,o_k ?
200.777,202.057,Bmr012-c5,qy^rt,30a,,,do you want this adam ?
203.018,203.418,Bmr012-c4,h|s^aa,30b,,,uh - | sure .

209.21,210.21,Bmr012-c1,fg,,,,so uh ==
209.371,211.791,Bmr012-c4,qy^cs^rt^t,31a,,,o_k so should we do agenda items ?
212.707,213.977,Bmr012-c1,h|s^ba,31b,,,uh - | oh - that's a good idea .
214.427,215.607,Bmr012-c1,s^cc,,,laughing after this,i shouldn't run the meeting .
219.425,223.375,Bmr012-c4,s^t,,,,uh - well i have - i wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff .
223.923,224.533,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,mmm .
224.842,228.272,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and i'm sure liz and andreas wanna talk about recognition results .
229.845,230.355,Bmr012-c4,qo^d^rt,,,,anything else ?
231.954,233.714,Bmr012-c2,qw^rt^t3,32a,,,i guess - what time do we have to leave ?
234.154,234.774,Bmr012-c2,qy^bu^d^rt^t3,32a+,,,three thirty ?
234.984,235.214,Bmr012-c0,s^aa^t3,32b,,,yeah .

246.27,251.76,Bmr012-c2,fh|s,,,,um - | with andreas' help um - andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer .
251.76,257.14,Bmr012-c2,s^e,,,,which is uh - gender-dependent but like - no adaptation no cross-word models no trigrams .
257.14,258.5,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,a bigram recognizer .
258.93,261.76,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,and that's trained on switchboard which is telephone conversations .
262.61,265.933,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,um - and thanks to don's help wh- - who ==
266.003,270.193,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,don took the first meeting that jane had transcribed .
270.583,277.183,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,and um - you know - separated - used the individual channels we segmented it in- - into the segments that jane had used .
277.813,280.883,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,and uh - don sampled that so - so eight k_ .
281.723,285.153,Bmr012-c2,fh|s^rt,,60=l=a.a,,um - | and then we ran up to i guess the first twenty minutes .
285.153,287.083,Bmr012-c2,s,,b.e,,up to synch time of one two zero zero .
287.653,289.103,Bmr012-c2,qy^d^rt,34a,,,so is that - that's twenty minutes or so ?
289.963,292.463,Bmr012-c2,fh|s.%--,,,,um - yeah | because i guess there's some ==
290.309,290.779,Bmr012-c4,s^na,34b,,,or so .
292.463,293.843,Bmr012-c2,s^cs,,,,and don can talk to jane about this .
293.843,297.213,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,there's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah - uh ==
297.633,300.883,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,i'm - we're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier .
301.303,303.263,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,anyway so it's twenty minutes and i actually ==
301.507,301.947,Bmr012-c4,b.%,,,,hmm .

315.585,317.175,Bmr012-c8,s.%-,,,,but i was able to can- - transcribe ==
315.925,317.125,Bmr012-c4,s^no,37b-2,,,i don't remember when it is .
316.038,320.768,Bmr012-c0,s,,,,suddenly - the - the overall error rate when we first ran it was like - eighty percent .
321.238,325.098,Bmr012-c0,s,,,,but i- - looking at - the first sentences looked much better than that .
325.428,326.858,Bmr012-c0,s,38a,,,and then suddenly it turned very bad .
326.858,330.118,Bmr012-c0,s.%-,38a+,70=l-=a.n.b.e,,and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the ==
330.584,333.014,Bmr012-c5,fg|s,38b-1,r**,,yeah | that might be - that might be - ** that might be my fault .
330.628,331.288,Bmr012-c2,%,,,,wel- ==
330.688,331.968,Bmr012-c0,s,,,,it was actually recognized .
330.758,331.748,Bmr012-c4,s^fe,38b-2,,,oh no !
331.424,333.484,Bmr012-c8,s^fe.%,,,,wow !
332.118,332.638,Bmr012-c0,fh,,,,so ==
333.014,333.414,Bmr012-c5,s.%-,,,,i'm not ==
333.021,335.641,Bmr012-c4,s,39a,,,oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .
333.599,333.939,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,o_k .
333.701,335.201,Bmr012-c2,s^ar.%--,39b,,,no actually it was ==
335.251,337.081,Bmr012-c2,fh|s,39b+.40a,,,yeah | i- - it was a complicated bug .
337.081,340.151,Bmr012-c2,s^df^rt,,,,because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random .
340.241,340.531,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,so ==
340.368,341.038,Bmr012-c8,b.%,,,,oh .
340.625,343.385,Bmr012-c5,fg|s,40b.41a,,,yeah | i was pretty certain that it worked up until that time .
341.098,341.848,Bmr012-c8,%,,,,that's not good .
341.121,341.541,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,um ==
342.975,343.365,Bmr012-c2,s^bk,42b,,,yeah .
343.385,343.995,Bmr012-c5,fh,,,,so ==
343.515,344.425,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,so that's what we have .
343.552,344.222,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,o_k .
343.723,344.143,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,alright .
344.249,344.609,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,yeah .
344.425,348.295,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,but that - that will be completely gone if this synch time problem .
346.218,348.562,Bmr012-c4,s,,r,,the - the glitch .
347.112,352.692,Bmr012-c0,s.%-,,,,so - so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh - whatever up to that time to ==
347.331,348.371,Bmr012-c8,s.%--,,,,and the only glitch ==
348.681,348.941,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,yeah .
348.932,349.072,Bmr012-c4,b.%,,,,yeah .
349.848,350.988,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,so you guys know .
351.507,353.157,Bmr012-c1,s^fa,,,,s- - sorry i haven't seen the email .
351.547,351.897,Bmr012-c2,b,,,,yeah .
351.963,356.083,Bmr012-c4,%,,,,th- - the ==
352.135,353.885,Bmr012-c8,%,,,,the - the - well - wait .
352.924,355.414,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,so here's the actual copy of the email .
353.157,354.257,Bmr012-c1,qw,,,,what was the score ?
353.885,355.025,Bmr012-c8,s^cs,,,,we should say something about the glitch .
355.025,356.155,Bmr012-c8,s^cs,,,,he - he can say something about the glitch .
355.834,357.074,Bmr012-c2,h|s^bk,,,,um - | oh o_k .
356.083,356.143,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,yeah .
356.205,358.495,Bmr012-c8,s^df,,,,cuz it's - it's - it's - h- - it's - it's very small .
357.164,359.254,Bmr012-c2,qy.%-,43a,,,so does this glitch occur at other ?==
357.876,365.067,Bmr012-c4,s,43b.44a,,,there - there - there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um - the channels get slightly asynchronized .
358.595,359.425,Bmr012-c8,s^r,,,,very small .
360.938,361.148,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,yep .
362.506,362.866,Bmr012-c2,s^bk,44b,,,oh .
365.305,365.685,Bmr012-c2,s^bk,44b+,,,right .
365.377,374.167,Bmr012-c4,s,43b+,,,so the - that - that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the s_s_h key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second .
365.393,365.703,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mmm .
373.34,373.88,Bmr012-c5,b,,,,hmm .
373.61,374.16,Bmr012-c1,b,,,,hmm .
374.897,376.577,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and so the channels get a little asynchronous .
376.577,381.037,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing - doing click sounds .
381.608,381.898,Bmr012-c1,fg,,,,so ==
381.623,383.323,Bmr012-c2,qy^rt,45a,,,and is it only once that that happens ?
382.047,382.157,Bmr012-c4,%-,,,,but ==
383.237,383.457,Bmr012-c4,s^aa,45b,,,yeah .
383.717,383.967,Bmr012-c4,%--,,,,it ==

383.967,384.847,Bmr012-c4,s^aa|s^na,45b+,,,right | once in the middle .
384.523,388.073,Bmr012-c2,s,46a,,,there's - the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong .
385.071,385.421,Bmr012-c1,fg,,,,so ==
388.073,388.273,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,but ==
388.202,391.184,Bmr012-c4,s,46b.47a,,,um - but that shouldn't affect anything .
388.276,391.156,Bmr012-c1,fg|s^j,,80=w0=a.a,,so | un- - unsurprisingly adam is the golden voice .
388.714,390.004,Bmr012-c8,%,,,,s- ==
388.753,389.103,Bmr012-c2,s^bk,47b,,,o_k .
389.103,389.983,Bmr012-c2,s.%-,,,,so that's actually ==
390.004,390.394,Bmr012-c8,%,,,,and it ==
391.156,391.916,Bmr012-c1,qy^d^rt,,,,you see this here ?
391.804,392.424,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,yeah yeah .
391.854,393.404,Bmr012-c2,s.%-,,,,it - y- - it's ==

395.122,395.452,Bmr012-c0,fg|%-,,,,oh | and ==
395.141,398.321,Bmr012-c2,s.%-,,,,what happens is it actually affects the script that don ==
397.76,398.57,Bmr012-c3,b,,,,huh .
398.321,401.211,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,i mean - if we know about it then i guess it could always be checked for it .
399.851,401.701,Bmr012-c4,s,48a,,,well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .
401.211,401.701,Bmr012-c2,%-,,,,but they ==
401.618,403.318,Bmr012-c5,s,,,,yeah i don't know exactly what affected it .
401.697,402.227,Bmr012-c8,s^aa,,,,i agree .
402.357,402.887,Bmr012-c8,s^aa,48b,,,i agree .
403.318,404.448,Bmr012-c5,s^cc,,,,but i'll - i'll talk to you about it .
403.66,404.19,Bmr012-c0,%-,,,,i - i have ==
404.144,407.819,Bmr012-c4,s.%-,,,,but i - i do remember ==
404.19,404.57,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,yeah .
404.448,405.958,Bmr012-c5,s^cc,,,,i'll show you the point .
404.485,404.735,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,yeah .
404.885,406.595,Bmr012-c8,s,,,,it - it had no effect on my transcription .
404.931,405.551,Bmr012-c2,b,,,,yeah .
406.595,409.905,Bmr012-c8,s,,,,you know - i mean - i - i had no trouble hearing it and - and having time bins .
406.905,407.565,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mmm .
409.905,411.165,Bmr012-c8,s.%-,,,,but there was a ==
410.053,416.943,Bmr012-c4,s^r,49a,,,i do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect x_m_l file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .
414.429,414.819,Bmr012-c8,s^bk,49b-1,,,oh .
416.604,417.614,Bmr012-c5,s^na,49b-2,,,that's what happened .
416.652,421.212,Bmr012-c2,s,49b-3.50a,r**,,well the - the synch time - ** the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should .
417.823,420.103,Bmr012-c8,s^bk,50b,,,oh .
417.946,418.246,Bmr012-cB,b,,,,yeah .
418.535,418.905,Bmr012-c5,%-,,,,there was ==
418.84,420.26,Bmr012-c4,s,49a+,,,where - where they weren't monotonic .
420.463,421.003,Bmr012-c5,fg|%-,,,,yeah | i mean ==
421.212,421.482,Bmr012-c2,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
421.482,424.152,Bmr012-c2,s,51a,,,there's things that are l- - in smaller increments than a frame .
422.743,423.063,Bmr012-cB,b,,,,yeah .
424.254,424.994,Bmr012-c8,s^ba,51b-1,,,oh interesting .
424.852,425.212,Bmr012-c4,s^bk,51b-2,,,oh o_k .
425.212,425.592,Bmr012-c4,s.%-,,,,so that's ==
425.221,425.671,Bmr012-c5,b,,,,hmm .
425.224,431.704,Bmr012-c2,s,52a,,,and so then i mean - you look at that and it's got you know - more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right .
429.98,431.19,Bmr012-c8,s^bk,52b-1,,,oh .
431.656,432.516,Bmr012-c4,fg|s^na,52b-2,,,yeah | sounds like a bug .
431.66,432.34,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,yeah .
431.744,432.494,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mmm .
431.814,433.754,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,so anyway it's - it's just ==
433.914,435.394,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,that's why we only have twenty minutes .
435.394,437.684,Bmr012-c2,s.%-,53a,,,but there's a significant amount of ==
436.618,437.378,Bmr012-c5,qy^2^d^rt,53b,,,non-zero ?
437.628,442.788,Bmr012-c5,s,,**r-,,um - there are like - more - ** cuz there's a lot of zeros i tacked on just because of the way the script ran .
439.257,440.517,Bmr012-c4,s.%-,,,,the other one i saw was that it ==
442.788,444.108,Bmr012-c5,s,54a,,,i mean - but there were- - there was a point .
442.895,443.255,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,yeah .
444.989,445.699,Bmr012-c2,s^na,54b,,,yeah that was fine .
445.801,448.761,Bmr012-c4,s,,,,the other one i saw was non- - non-monotonic synch times .
445.989,446.849,Bmr012-c2,s^na,54b+,,,that - that was o_k .
447.213,447.603,Bmr012-c5,%,,,,o_k .
448.761,450.701,Bmr012-c4,s,55a,,,and that definitely indicra- - indicates a bug .
449.306,449.606,Bmr012-c5,fg,,,,uh ==
449.9,451.51,Bmr012-c2,s,55b,,,well that would really be a problem .
451.51,451.86,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,yeah .
451.86,457.37,Bmr012-c2,s,56a,,,so anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .
453.911,454.281,Bmr012-c5,b,,,,yeah .
458.01,459.86,Bmr012-c2,qw.%-,,,,um - and what's - which ?==
458.615,460.575,Bmr012-c4,s^ba,56b.57a,90=l-=g;c.a,,so that's very encouraging .
459.86,462.36,Bmr012-c2,s,57b,b.c,,this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition .
460.149,460.389,Bmr012-cB,b,,,,yeah .
460.439,460.499,Bmr012-c1,b,,,,hmm .
461.033,461.283,Bmr012-c1,b,,,,cool .
462.36,465.75,Bmr012-c2,s,58a,,,there's no i mean - the language model for switchboard is totally different .
462.698,463.068,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mmm .
465.75,469.64,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,59b,**b,,so you can see some like this ** trent lott which ==
467.299,467.839,Bmr012-c3,s^j,58b.59a,100=w-=ga.a,,trent lott .
469.64,470.57,Bmr012-c2,fh,,b.c,,um - i mean ==
470.74,471.91,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,these are sort of funny ones .
470.883,471.703,Bmr012-c3,s,,,,it'll get those though .
471.91,474.86,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references .
474.86,478.63,Bmr012-c2,s^cs,60a,,,i mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see .
477.389,481.348,Bmr012-c4,s^rt,60b,,,i - and as i said i would like to look at the lattices .
478.157,478.907,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
478.63,478.91,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,but ==
479.5,480.44,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,um - it's pretty good .
481.348,484.438,Bmr012-c4,s^df,,,,because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right .
484.87,486.87,Bmr012-c2,s^cs.%-,,,,well so i guess we can generate ==
484.968,485.868,Bmr012-c4,%-,,,,sounds likes ==
486.719,487.859,Bmr012-c8,b,,,,mm-hmm .
486.864,493.434,Bmr012-c0,s,61a,,,there are a fair number of errors that are you know - where - got the plural s_ wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .
487.64,488.51,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,um ==
491.723,491.903,Bmr012-c4,s^bk,61b,,,yeah .
491.903,492.503,Bmr012-c4,qh^nd,61b+,,,and who cares ?
492.503,499.103,Bmr012-c4,s,62a,,,and - and there were lots of - of course the uh uh - -s in on - -s of uh - -s .
494.524,495.594,Bmr012-c0,%-,,,,mmm so if ==
494.535,494.775,Bmr012-c2,%-,,,,there's ==
497.072,498.292,Bmr012-c2,s^ar.%--,62b,,,no those are actually ==
497.618,497.758,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,yeah .
498.762,501.192,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,a lot of the errors i think are out of vocabulary .
501.192,503.482,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,so is it like p_z_m is three words .
501.292,502.492,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
503.482,504.772,Bmr012-c2,s^e,,,,it's p_z_m .
504.352,505.392,Bmr012-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
504.772,505.662,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,i mean - there's nothing ==
505.637,505.907,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,right .
506.042,508.572,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,63a,110=w-=a;c.a,,there's no language model for p_z_m or ==
506.067,506.737,Bmr012-c4,b,,,,ri- - ri- - right .
508.572,509.292,Bmr012-c2,fh,,,,um ==
508.987,510.697,Bmr012-c4,qy^bu^rt,63b.64a,b,,did you say there's no language for p_z_m ?
510.792,512.242,Bmr012-c2,s^aa.%-,64b,,,no language model i mean - those ==
512.745,515.185,Bmr012-c4,qy^rt,65a,b,,do you mean so every time someone says p_z_m it's an error ?
515.585,517.635,Bmr012-c4,s^cs^j,,b-,,maybe we shouldn't say p_z_m in these meetings .
517.307,519.617,Bmr012-c2,fg|s^df,65b.66a,c##120=l=ag.a,,well - | well there's all kinds of other stuff like jimlet .
519.617,522.317,Bmr012-c2,fh|%--,,,,and i mean - um - | anyway there ==
519.876,521.116,Bmr012-c4,s^bk^j,66b-1,b.c,FBH,yeah that's right jimlet .
522.214,523.374,Bmr012-c1,s,67a.66b-2,130=l=ag.a.b,FBH,well we don't even know what that means .
522.317,526.247,Bmr012-c2,s.%--,,,,so but this is really encouraging because ==
523.271,524.231,Bmr012-c4,s^aa,67b,b.e,,yeah that's right .
523.374,523.604,Bmr012-c1,%-,,,,so i ==
526.457,539.717,Bmr012-c2,s,,,,so i mean - the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data um - it should be uh - reasonable to actually run recognition and be like - within the scope of - of r- - reasonable s- - you know switchboard .
539.717,545.917,Bmr012-c2,s,68a,,,this is like h- - about how well we do on switchboard-two data with the switchboard-one trained - mostly trained recognizer .
