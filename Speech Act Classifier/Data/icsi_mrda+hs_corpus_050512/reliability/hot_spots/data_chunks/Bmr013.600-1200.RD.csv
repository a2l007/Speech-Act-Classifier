602.138,602.978,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,on some subset .
603.51,608.01,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,one thought might be to do this uh - on - on the digits or some piece of the digits .
608.01,610.48,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,uh - it'd be easier uh - and so forth .
610.48,614.577,Bmr013-c3,s.%--,,,,the only thing is i'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena in w- - i- - i- ==
614.827,632.341,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,the reason for doing it is because the - the argument is that certainly with conversational speech the stuff that we've looked at here before um - just doing the simple mapping from um - the phone to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book uh - isn't right .
632.826,633.576,Bmr013-c3,s^r,,,,it isn't actually right .
633.576,640.448,Bmr013-c3,s^e,,,,in fact there's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some you know - some nasality is - comes in here and so forth .
640.448,643.308,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,and you do this gross thing saying well i guess it's this phone starting there .
644.028,645.99,Bmr013-c3,fh|s,,,,so uh - | that's the reasoning .
645.99,653.191,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,but it could be that when we're reading digits because it's - it's for such a limited set that maybe - maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much .
653.191,653.601,Bmr013-c3,s^no,,,,i don't know .
654.1,657.21,Bmr013-c3,qo^rt,1a,,,di- - an- - anybody do you have any - anybody have any opinion about that ?
662.107,663.977,Bmr013-c2,s,,,,and that people might articulate more .
664.067,666.397,Bmr013-c2,s,1b.2a,,,and you that might end up with more - a closer correspondence .
664.552,664.862,Bmr013-c3,b,2b-1,,,<or> mm-hmm .
666.699,666.949,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
666.751,668.081,Bmr013-c8,s^na,2b-2,,,yeah - that's - i - i agree .
668.161,669.051,Bmr013-c8,%-,,,,that - it's just ==
668.39,669.59,Bmr013-c4,s,,,,sort of less predictability .
669.59,720.519,Bmr013-c4,%-,,,,and - you hafta ==
669.728,669.988,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
669.848,670.108,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
670.5,679.451,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,well it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're re-reading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns .
670.998,696.684,Bmr013-c8,fg|qy,,,,it's a - well - | would this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ?
679.451,682.732,Bmr013-cB,s^e,,,,mitch showed that and some dissertations have shown that .
680.514,680.704,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
683.501,690.311,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading in a room of people or rea- - you know - just the fact that they're reading will make a difference .
690.648,690.928,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
691.153,692.973,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,and depends what you're interested in .
697.795,698.375,Bmr013-c3,s^no,,,,see i don't know .
698.375,707.517,Bmr013-c3,s^cs,,,,so may- - maybe the thing will be do - to take some very small subset i- - mean - not have a big program but take a small set uh - subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits .
708.141,710.495,Bmr013-c3,s^cs,,,,and look and - and just get a feeling for it .
710.993,712.802,Bmr013-c3,fh|s^cs,,,,um - | just take a look really .
713.59,726.347,Bmr013-c2,s,,,,h- - that could - could be an interesting design too cuz then you'd have the com- - the comparison of the uh - predictable speech versus the less predictable speech .
713.663,717.37,Bmr013-c3,s^df.%--,,10=l=a.a,,cuz i don't think anybody is - i- - at least i don't know of anybody uh ==
718.382,720.721,Bmr013-c3,s^no,,b.c,,well i don't know the answers .
721.552,721.872,Bmr013-c4,fg,,,,hey ==
725.821,726.021,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
726.347,729.917,Bmr013-c2,s,,,,and maybe you'd find that it worked in - in the case of the pr- - of the uh - non-predictable .
728.518,728.698,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
729.348,739.643,Bmr013-c4,s,,,,hafta think about the particular acoustic features to mark too because i mean - some things they wouldn't be able to mark like - uh - you know - uh - tense lax .
733.642,733.932,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,mm-hmm .
739.773,740.903,Bmr013-c4,s,3a,,,some things are really difficult .
741.737,742.057,Bmr013-c4,qy^d^f^g^rt,3a+,,,you know ?
742.297,743.067,Bmr013-c4,s,3a++,,,just listening .
742.37,745.59,Bmr013-c8,s^cs,3b.3.5a,,,m- - i think we can get ohala in to give us some advice on that .
742.671,742.931,Bmr013-c2,fg,,,,well ==
745.042,745.422,Bmr013-c4,s^na,3.5b,,,yeah .
745.696,748.776,Bmr013-c2,s.%--,4a.5a,20=w-=a.a,,also i thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features that ==
749.028,754.822,Bmr013-c3,s,4b,b**c,,yeah but i - i - i - i was - like he said i was gonna bring john in ** and ask john what he thought .
752.772,753.282,Bmr013-c2,s^bk,,,,yeah sure .
754.027,754.377,Bmr013-c2,s^bk^r,,,,sure .
754.801,754.961,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,yeah .
755.113,755.293,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
755.908,759.048,Bmr013-c3,s^aa|s^arp,5b,,,but i mean - you want - you want it be restrictive | but you also want it to - to - to have coverage .
759.219,759.469,Bmr013-c8,b,,,,right .
759.615,773.884,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,you know i- - you should - it should be such that if you - if you uh - if you had o- - um - all of the features determined that you - that you were uh - ch- - have chosen that that would tell you uh - in the steady-state case uh - the phone .
759.81,759.9,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,yeah .
774.572,775.38,Bmr013-c3,fh,,,,so um ==
775.129,775.289,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,o_k .
776.436,778.616,Bmr013-c8,s^bu,6a,,,even i guess with vowels that would be pretty hard .
778.926,779.286,Bmr013-c8,qy^g^rt,6a+,,,wouldn't it ?
782.592,784.912,Bmr013-c8,s,6a++,,,to identify actually you know - which one it is .
785.562,790.105,Bmr013-c2,s.%--,6b,,,it would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m- - more g- ==
790.105,796.669,Bmr013-c2,s,7a,,,uh - i mean - that's - i think about articulatory features i think about points of articulation which means uh - rather than vowels .
795.649,795.859,Bmr013-c8,b,,,,yeah .
797.421,798.411,Bmr013-c4,qw^bu^m^rt,7b,,,points of articulation ?
798.411,798.801,Bmr013-c4,qw^rt,8a,,,what do you mean ?
799.207,804.035,Bmr013-c2,s,8b,,,so is it uh - bilabial or dental or is it you know - palatal .
803.629,803.989,Bmr013-c3,b.%,,,,mm-hmm .
804.787,807.197,Bmr013-c2,s^e,8b+.9a,,,which - which are all like where - where your tongue comes to rest .
805.976,806.926,Bmr013-c8,s.%,,,,uvular .
806.342,807.892,Bmr013-c4,s,,r-,,place of ar- - place of articulation .
806.52,807.34,Bmr013-c3,s^m,,r,,place place .
807.942,808.282,Bmr013-c2,s^bsc^m,9b.10a,,,place .
807.984,808.174,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
807.993,808.373,Bmr013-c1,s.%,,,,{@reject@} place .
808.282,810.102,Bmr013-c2,s^ft.%--,10b,,,thank you what - whatev- - whatever i s- - said that's ==
808.643,808.903,Bmr013-c4,b.%,,,,o_k .
810.041,810.231,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
810.102,810.962,Bmr013-c2,s,,,,i really meant place .
810.277,811.057,Bmr013-c4,s^bk,,,,o_k i see .
811.618,811.808,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
812.092,813.442,Bmr013-c3,fg|s^tc,,,,o_k | we got our jargon then o_k .
813.551,813.831,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,yeah .
814.34,814.85,Bmr013-c3,fh,,,,uh ==
815.367,823.611,Bmr013-cB,fg|s^tc,,,,well it's also - | there's really a difference between the pronunciation models in the dictionary and the pronunciations that people produce .
823.731,828.652,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,and so you get some of that information from steve's work on the - on the labeling .
827.72,827.94,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
827.979,828.209,Bmr013-c8,b,,,,right .
828.652,829.272,Bmr013-cB,%--,,,,and it really ==
830.609,832.689,Bmr013-cB,s^cs,,,,i actually think that data should be used more .
832.689,840.13,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,that maybe - although i think the meeting context is great - that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence .
840.921,850.692,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,and you can go from - not from that to the articulatory features but that would be a better starting point for marking the gestural features then data where you don't have that .
850.692,867.45,Bmr013-cB,s,11a,,,because we - you wanna know both about the way that they're producing a certain sound and what kinds of - you know - what kinds of phonemic differences you get between these transcribed sequences and the dictionary ones .
867.607,871.367,Bmr013-c3,s^aap,11b,,,well you might be right that mi- - might be the way at getting at what i was talking about .
871.367,881.834,Bmr013-c3,s^arp,11b+,,,but the particular reason why i was interested in doing that was because i remember when that happened and john ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones .
882.859,888.335,Bmr013-c3,fh|s,,,,uh - | he didn't know what to say about what is the sequence of phones there .
888.425,889.665,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,they came up with some compromise .
890.272,891.992,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,because that really wasn't what it look like .
891.75,892.2,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
891.992,893.572,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,it didn't look like a sequence of phones .
892.14,892.37,Bmr013-c8,b,,,,right .
893.572,896.162,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here .
895.622,896.002,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
895.722,898.552,Bmr013-c8,s^na,,,,yeah so you have this feature here and overlap yeah .
896.929,898.009,Bmr013-c4,s,,,,there was no name for that .
897.119,897.429,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
897.252,898.243,Bmr013-cB,fg,,,,but - right .
898.17,898.32,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
898.293,900.795,Bmr013-cB,s^nd^tc,,,,but it still is - there's a - there are two steps .
900.795,908.068,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,one - you know - one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like gonna see you tomorrow .
901.365,911.249,Bmr013-c8,s.%,,30=l=g.a,,and - or gonta .
904.302,904.612,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
906.934,907.154,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
908.068,910.478,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,it could be going to or gonna or gonta s- - you know .
910.078,910.298,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
910.92,911.94,Bmr013-cB,fh,,b.r,,and yeah .
912.424,914.384,Bmr013-cB,s,,c,,gonna see you tomorrow uh - guh see you tomorrow .
914.774,923.381,Bmr013-cB,s^cs,,,,and that it would be nice to have these intermediate or these - some - these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well .
920.955,921.335,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,mm-hmm .
924.132,938.332,Bmr013-cB,s^df,12a,,,because it's not um - that easy to go from the dictionary word pronuncia- - the dictionary phone pronunciation to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of representation .
937.645,939.845,Bmr013-c8,s^nd,12b,,,well i don't think morgan's suggesting that we do that though .
938.451,938.801,Bmr013-c3,qy^bu.%-,,,,do you mean ?==
940.794,941.024,Bmr013-c1,b.%,,,,yeah .
940.801,948.104,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,yeah i mean - i- - i- - i'm jus- - at the moment of course we're just talking about what to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it .
948.104,956.595,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,so for instance you might have someone who just has a wor- - has words with states and has uh - uh - comes from articulatory gestures to that .
956.595,960.381,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,and someone else might actually want some phonetic uh - intermediate thing .
960.909,963.599,Bmr013-c3,s^cs,,,,so i think it would be - be best to have all of it if we could .
964.307,965.097,Bmr013-c3,fh,,,,but um ==
964.954,970.272,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,but - what i'm imagining is a score-like notation where each line is a particular feature .
965.673,965.853,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
970.693,970.923,Bmr013-c8,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
970.923,975.653,Bmr013-c8,s^e,,,,so you would say you know - it's voiced through here and so you have label here and you have nas- - nasal here .
971.211,971.421,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
975.653,980.982,Bmr013-c8,s^e,,,,and they - they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones .
981.604,982.674,Bmr013-c3,s.%--,,,,i mean - this is the kind of reason why ==
982.674,990.674,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,i remember when at one of the switchboard workshops that uh - when we talked about doing the transcription project dave talkin said can't be done .
991.003,991.273,Bmr013-c8,b,,,,right .
991.882,996.24,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,he was - he was what - what he meant was that this isn't you know - a sequence of phones .
996.24,1005.11,Bmr013-c3,s.%-,,,,and when you actually look at switchboard that's not what you see and you know - and it ==
998.999,1002.19,Bmr013-c8,s^bu,13a,,,and in - in fact the inter-annotator agreement was not that good .
1002.19,1002.53,Bmr013-c8,qy^d^g^rt,13a+,,,right ?
1003,1003.95,Bmr013-c8,qy^e^rt,13a++,,,on the harder ones ?
1005.22,1006.06,Bmr013-c3,s^aa|s.%-,13b-1,,,yeah | i mean - it was- ==
1005.3,1007.33,Bmr013-cB,s.%--,13b-2,,,it depends how you look at it and ==
1007.41,1011.11,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,i - i understand what you're saying about this kind of transcription exactly .
1009.7,1009.91,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1011.11,1013.99,Bmr013-cB,s^df,,,,because i've seen - you know - where does the voicing bar start and so forth .
1012.29,1012.5,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1014.43,1022.51,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,all i'm saying is that it is useful to have that - the transcription of what was really said and which syllables were reduced .
1023.09,1024.76,Bmr013-cB,fh|s^e,,,,uh - | if you're gonna add the features .
1024.76,1034.7,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,it's also useful to have some level of representation which is - is a reduced - it's a pronunciation variant that currently the dictionaries don't give you .
1033.58,1033.89,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1034.7,1038.6,Bmr013-cB,s^df,,,,because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition you - you add confusion .
1037.53,1037.76,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
1038.83,1040.41,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,so people purposely don't add them .
1038.94,1039.14,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
1041.64,1046.21,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,so it's useful to know which variant was - was produced at least at the phone level .
1045.29,1057.45,Bmr013-c4,s^cs,13.5a,,,so it would be - it would be great if we had either these kind of labelings on the same portion of switchboard that steve marked or steve's type markings on this data with these .
1055.13,1055.58,Bmr013-cB,s^aa,13.5b,,,right .
1055.78,1056.27,Bmr013-cB,s,13.5b+,,,that's all i mean .
1056.57,1057.17,Bmr013-cB,s^aa,13.5b++,,,exactly .
1057.15,1057.35,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1057.7,1058.24,Bmr013-cB,s^aa^r,,,,exactly .
1058.26,1059.72,Bmr013-c3,fg|s,,,,yeah | no i - i don't disagree with that .
1058.86,1061.59,Bmr013-cB,s^df,,,,and steve's type is fairly - it's not that slow .
1061.77,1062.67,Bmr013-cB,fh,,,,uh - uh ==
1062.67,1065.33,Bmr013-cB,s^no.%--,,,,i dunno exactly what the timing was but ==
1064.47,1065.81,Bmr013-c3,fg|s^aap,,,,yeah | u- - i don't disagree with it .
1065.81,1069.73,Bmr013-c3,s^arp.%--,,,,the on- - the only thing is that what you actually will end - en- - end up with is something ==
1069.73,1071.09,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,i- - it's all compromised .
1071.09,1071.28,Bmr013-c3,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
1071.28,1076.34,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,so the string that you end up with isn't actually what happened .
1076.54,1081.35,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,but it's - it's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .
1081.54,1081.91,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1081.74,1084.21,Bmr013-c4,s^e,,r,,and it's more accurate than phone labels .
1082.54,1089.96,Bmr013-c3,s^m,,,,but - and it's more accurate than the - than the dictionary or if you've got a pronunciation uh - lexicon that has three or four .
1083.52,1083.93,Bmr013-c8,b.%,,,,the word .
1085.22,1085.41,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1089.96,1092.66,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,this might be have been the fifth one that you tr- - that you pruned or whatever .
1091.14,1092.17,Bmr013-c4,s^bs,,,,so it's like a continuum .
1091.23,1091.6,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
1092.03,1092.28,Bmr013-cB,fg,,,,right .
1092.17,1093.58,Bmr013-c4,s,,,,it's - you're going all the way down .
1092.66,1093.13,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,so sure .
1092.76,1093.05,Bmr013-cB,fg,,,,right .
1093.48,1094.59,Bmr013-cB,s.%--,,,,that's what i meant is ==
1093.77,1093.96,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,yeah .
1093.95,1094.13,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1094.59,1099.55,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,an- - and in some places it would fill in so - the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere .
1094.92,1095.16,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1096.87,1097.08,Bmr013-c8,fg,,,,well ==
1099.85,1100.11,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,right .
1099.88,1103.66,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,so there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram .
1103.79,1104.12,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1104.03,1107.34,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,but you know what phone it was and that's about all you can - all you can say .
1106.82,1107.04,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,right .
1107.34,1110.24,Bmr013-cB,s.%-,,,,and then there are other cases where nasality voicing ==
1108.62,1113.58,Bmr013-c4,s,14.5a,,,it's basically just having multiple levels of - of information and marking on the signal .
1110.9,1111.22,Bmr013-cB,s^aa,14.5b,,,right .
1112.18,1112.49,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
1112.78,1112.98,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
1113.15,1113.27,Bmr013-cB,b.x,,,,right .
1113.18,1117.19,Bmr013-c8,s,14a,,,well the other difference is that the - the features are not synchronous .
1117.19,1117.42,Bmr013-c8,qy^d^f^g,,,,right ?
1117.42,1119.51,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,they overlap each other in weird ways .
1118.68,1119.04,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1119.63,1119.95,Bmr013-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1120.04,1121.96,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,so it's not a strictly one-dimensional signal .
1122.46,1122.69,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,right .
1122.98,1125.01,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,so i think that's sorta qualitatively different .
1123.65,1123.91,Bmr013-cB,fg,,,,right .
1123.91,1127.51,Bmr013-cB,s^aa|s^arp,14b,,,you can add the features in | uh - but it'll be underspecified .
1126.62,1126.83,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,hmm .
1127.51,1130.98,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,th- - there'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features .
1132.12,1138.37,Bmr013-c8,s^aa|s^arp,15a,40=l=d.a,,well not with our current system | but you could imagine designing a system that the states were features rather than phones .
1132.21,1132.92,Bmr013-cB,%-,,,,and i- - if you're ==
1140.19,1145.35,Bmr013-cB,s^arp^tc,15b,b**c,,well we - we've probably have a separate um - discussion ** of uh - of whether you can do that .
1140.69,1147.12,Bmr013-c2,qy^bu^rt,16a,,,that's - well isn't that - i thought that was - well but that - wasn't that kinda the direction ?
1142.94,1143.16,Bmr013-c8,s^aa,16b,b,,yeah .
1147.12,1147.42,Bmr013-c2,s.%--,,,,i thought ==
1147.56,1155.73,Bmr013-c3,fg|s,,,,yeah | so i mean - what - what - where this is i mean - i- - i want- - would like to have something that's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research i have in mind .
1155.73,1156.88,Bmr013-c3,s^cs,,,,so it should be something broader .
1156.88,1185.31,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,but the - but uh - where i'm coming from is uh - we're coming off of stuff that larry saul did with - with um - uh - john dalan and muzim rahim in which uh - they uh - have um - a m- - a multi-band system that is uh - trained through a combination of gradient learning an- - and e_m to um - estimate uh - the uh - value for m- - for - for a particular feature .
1185.5,1185.82,Bmr013-c3,qy^d^f^g,,,,o_k ?
1186.29,1199.23,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,and this is part of a larger image that john dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he's sort of imagining that individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate of - of these - these kinds of - something like this .
1199.23,1201.99,Bmr013-c3,s,,,,might not be you know - exact features that jakobson thought of or something .
