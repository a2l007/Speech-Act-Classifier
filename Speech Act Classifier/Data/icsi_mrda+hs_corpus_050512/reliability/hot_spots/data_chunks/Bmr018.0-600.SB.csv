0.07,0.64,Bmr018-c8,z,1a,,,how about channel ?==
0.557,0.817,Bmr018-c0,z,,,,o_k .
0.706,2.086,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,we're recording .
0.8,1.33,Bmr018-c2,z,1b.2a,,,yeah go ahead .
1.55,1.96,Bmr018-c8,z,2b,,,alright .
2.425,3.505,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,alright and no crash .
4.23,5.16,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,i pre-crashed it .
4.421,5.461,Bmr018-c0,z,,,,hmm .
5.63,5.85,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,yeah .
5.86,6.48,Bmr018-c5,z,,,,pre-crashed !
7.31,8.61,Bmr018-c3,z,,,,it never crashes on me .
8.849,9.929,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,i think it's actually ==
9.54,10.84,Bmr018-c3,z,2a,,,what is - what is that ?
10.029,12.829,Bmr018-c4,z,2b.3a,,,it depends on if the temp files are there or not .
12.829,14.849,Bmr018-c4,z,2b+.3a+,,,that - at least that's my current working hypothesis .
14.03,14.76,Bmr018-c3,z,3b,,,ah .
15.371,19.521,Bmr018-c4,z,3a+,,,that i think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they're too big it crashes .
19.53,20,Bmr018-c3,z,3b++,,,ah .
20.2,23.75,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,when the power went out the other day and i restarted it it crashed the first time .
22.59,23.24,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,oh that's right .
24.849,25.649,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,after the power out- ==
24.86,26.36,Bmr018-c3,z,4a,,,so then there would be no temp files .
27.346,27.606,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,yeah .
27.94,30.35,Bmr018-c4,z,4b.5a,,,uh no it doesn't - it doesn't clear those necessarily .
28.395,28.455,Bmr018-c3,z,,,,<o_k> hmm .
28.455,29.265,Bmr018-c3,z,,,,oh wait it ==
29.585,30.265,Bmr018-c3,z,5b,,,it - {it} doesn't clear them .
30.265,30.485,Bmr018-c3,z,5b+,,,o_k .
30.45,30.63,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,so ==
31.327,32.237,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,hmm no connection .
31.748,33.238,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,it's - i- - they're called temp files .
33.238,35.448,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,but they're not actually in the temp directory they're in the scratch .
35.758,35.968,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,so ==
36.596,39.976,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,they're not backed up but they're not erased either on power failure .
40.659,43.699,Bmr018-c3,z,6a,,,but that's usually the meeting that i recorded and it neve- - it doesn't crash on me .
45.011,45.431,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,oh well .
45.24,53.761,Bmr018-c1,z,6b.7a,,,well this wasn't - actually this wasn't a- - before your meeting this was um - tuesday afternoon when um - uh - robert just wanted to do a little recording .
48.427,48.557,Bmr018-c3,z,,,,oh ==
53.28,53.73,Bmr018-c3,z,7b,,,oh right .
53.79,54.17,Bmr018-c3,z,7b+,,,o_k .
53.861,55.541,Bmr018-c1,z,8a,,,and the power had gone out earlier in the day .
56.318,56.938,Bmr018-c3,z,8b,,,huh o_k .
58.089,59.679,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,i don't know when would be a good excuse for it .
59.679,66.269,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,but i just can't wait to be giving a talk t- - and - and - and use the example from last week with everybody t- - doing the digits at once .
66.64,66.79,Bmr018-c4,z,,,,yeah .
67.667,68.687,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,i'd love to play somebody that .

69.26,69.91,Bmr018-c0,z,,,,that was fun .
69.857,70.607,Bmr018-c3,z,9a,,,it was quick .
71.32,71.61,Bmr018-c2,z,9b,,,it was .
71.61,72.5,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,it was really efficient .
73.509,74.729,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,talk about a good noise shield .
74.989,75.339,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,you know ?
76.25,80.12,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,you wanted to pe- - keep people from listening in you could like have that playing outside the room .
80.12,80.96,Bmr018-c1,z,,,,nobody could listen in .
81.003,81.293,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,yeah .
81.41,83.77,Bmr018-c3,z,10a,,,well i had this idea we could make our whole meeting faster that way .
84.256,84.446,Bmr018-c2,z,10b,,,yeah .
84.926,87.816,Bmr018-c2,z,,,,everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time .
86.735,87.635,Bmr018-c3,z,11a,,,and we'll just all leave .

174.736,175.086,Bmr018-c5,b,,,,oh .
177.765,180.105,Bmr018-c2,s,,,,and we do have the time work difference running the right way .
180.579,183.079,Bmr018-c2,s,,,,but i still think that there's no way we could start before eleven .
183.079,184.409,Bmr018-c2,s,,,,it might end up really being twelve .
184.749,188.089,Bmr018-c2,s^rt,,,,so when we get closer we'll find people's plane schedules and let everybody know .
189.966,192.279,Bmr018-c2,fh|s^ba,,,,uh | so - that's good .
191.503,195.253,Bmr018-c4,fg|s^cs^t,,,,<yeah> but uh - | yeah maybe an agenda or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea .
196.52,198.42,Bmr018-c2,s^cs,,,,well we can start gathering those - those ideas .
198.42,201.12,Bmr018-c2,s^co,,,,but then we - we should firm it up by next - next thursday's meeting .
202.12,209.9,Bmr018-c0,qy^rt,30a,,,will we have time to um - to prepare something that we - in the format we were planning for the i_b_m transcribers by then ?
210.29,210.56,Bmr018-c0,qrr.%--,30a+,,,or ?==
211.01,211.34,Bmr018-c4,s^aa,30b,,,oh yeah .

217.51,219.64,Bmr018-c1,s^fa,,,,he's - i - i'm sorry i should have forwarded that along .
220.41,222.49,Bmr018-c1,fh|s,,,,uh - | oh i - i think i mentioned at the last meeting .
222.49,224.972,Bmr018-c1,s,32a,,,he said that um - he talked to them .
224.972,226.232,Bmr018-c1,s,32a+,,,and it was fine with the beeps .
226.232,228.812,Bmr018-c1,s,32a++,,,they would be - that's easy for them to do .
227.91,228.13,Bmr018-c4,s^ba,32b,,,great .
229.14,229.34,Bmr018-c4,b,,,,o_k .

232.31,233.26,Bmr018-c4,fh,,,,um - but uh ==
234.68,236.83,Bmr018-c4,s.x,,,,i - i have the program to insert the beeps .
236.83,243.36,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,what i don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps .
243.36,244.64,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,but that should be really easy to do .
245.58,247.48,Bmr018-c4,qy^rt,33a,,,so do we have a meeting that that's been done with ?
248.69,252.54,Bmr018-c4,s^e^rt,33a+,,,that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to i_b_m and have them try it out .
248.86,249.39,Bmr018-c0,s.%-,,,,he's - he's ==
252.77,257.55,Bmr018-c0,s^na,33b,,,he generated um - a channel-wise presegmented version of a meeting .
257.82,263.7,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,but it was robustness rather than e_d_u so i guess depends on whether we're willing to use robustness .
262.61,263.02,Bmr018-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
262.77,265.86,Bmr018-c1,s,34a,,,well for this experiment i think we can use pre- - pretty much anything .
266.118,266.428,Bmr018-c0,s^bk,34b-1,,,o_k .
266.6,267.71,Bmr018-c1,s.%-,,,,this experiment of just ==
266.869,270.982,Bmr018-c4,s^ng,34b-2,,,well we had - we had talked about doing maybe e_d_u as a good choice though .
271.042,272.195,Bmr018-c4,s,34b-2+,,,well whatever we have .
271.57,274.48,Bmr018-c1,s,35a,r-**,,well we've talked ** about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe .
274.765,275.085,Bmr018-c4,s^aa,35b,,,right .
275.126,278.356,Bmr018-c1,s.%-,,,,but for the purpose of sending him a sample one to f- ==
275.4,275.64,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,o_k .
277.466,278.456,Bmr018-c4,s^am,,,,yeah maybe it doesn't matter .
278.34,278.67,Bmr018-c0,fg,,,,great .
278.416,279.266,Bmr018-c1,s.%-,,,,i - i don't think it matte- ==
278.94,281.92,Bmr018-c0,s^cc,36a,,,i'll - i'll - i'll um - get - make that available .
281.999,283.589,Bmr018-c4,s^bk|qy^rt,36b.37a,,,o_k | and has it been corrected ?
284.35,285.19,Bmr018-c0,h|s^co,37b,,,oh well | wait .
285.19,285.56,Bmr018-c0,h,,,,um ==
285.233,285.683,Bmr018-c4,qy^bu^d^rt,,,,hand-checked ?
285.683,289.27,Bmr018-c4,s^df,38a,,,cuz that was one of the processes we were talking about as well .
288.51,291.07,Bmr018-c1,fh|s^co,,,,right | so we need to run thilo's thing on it .
289.72,290.38,Bmr018-c0,s^bk,38b,,,that's right .
291.07,292.83,Bmr018-c1,s,39a,,,and then we go in and adjust the boundaries .
292.385,293.075,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,39b,,,yeah that's right .
293.255,294.105,Bmr018-c0,s,39b+,,,yeah we haven't done that .
294.29,295.78,Bmr018-c4,s^e,,,,and time how long it takes .
294.315,296.425,Bmr018-c0,s^cc,40a,,,i - i could set someone on that tomorrow .
294.318,294.588,Bmr018-c1,b,,,,right .
296.827,297.037,Bmr018-c1,s^bk,40b,,,o_k .
297.037,302.407,Bmr018-c1,s,41a,,,and we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try .
297.372,297.782,Bmr018-c0,s.%--,,,,i think they're coming ==
300.615,300.885,Bmr018-c0,s^bk,41b,,,o_k .
302.67,304.5,Bmr018-c0,qw,42a,,,what would be a good number of minutes ?
306.37,306.58,Bmr018-c1,s^no,42b-1,,,i don't know .
306.58,310.2,Bmr018-c1,s^cs.%--,42b-1+,,,maybe we can figure out how long it'll take to - to do ==
308.97,309.49,Bmr018-c4,fg,,,,um ==
310.59,310.82,Bmr018-c4,s^no,42b-2.43a,,,i don't know .
310.82,313.878,Bmr018-c4,s^cs,,,,it seems to me w- - we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting .
313.878,316.678,Bmr018-c4,s^df,42b-2++.43a++,,,because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime .
320.13,320.63,Bmr018-c2,s^arp,43b,,,yes .
320.63,330.079,Bmr018-c2,s.%--,43b+,,,except that if they had - if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them ==
331.06,332.09,Bmr018-c2,s.%-,,,,it's just dependent of how much ==
331.088,333.198,Bmr018-c4,s,44a,,,like i - i mean i guess if we have to do it again anyway .
333.368,333.868,Bmr018-c4,fh,,,,but uh ==
334.75,335,Bmr018-c2,s^am,44b,,,yeah .
335.61,338.28,Bmr018-c1,s.%--,,,,i guess the only thing i'm not sure about is um ==
338.93,342.58,Bmr018-c1,qw,,,,how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ?
341.951,342.291,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
343.2,343.61,Bmr018-c1,%--,,,,and ==
345.24,346.71,Bmr018-c1,qy^rt,,,,i mean is it pretty easy ?
346.23,348.08,Bmr018-c4,s.%--,,,,i think it's gonna be one or two times real time at ==
348.518,350.808,Bmr018-c4,s^fe|s^bsc,,,,wow | excuse me two or more times real time !
350.808,350.938,Bmr018-c4,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
350.938,352.378,Bmr018-c4,s^df,,,,cuz they have to at least listen to it .
353.35,361.35,Bmr018-c2,qy^rt,45a,,,can we pipeline it so that say there's uh - the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we - you run it through this other - other stuff ?
361.971,363.271,Bmr018-c4,s^ng,45b,,,well the other stuff is i_b_m .
362.016,362.546,Bmr018-c2,fh,45a,,,uh ==
364.311,373.632,Bmr018-c4,s,46a,,,i'm just thinking that from a data - keeping-track-of-the-data point of view it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces .
365.82,366.56,Bmr018-c2,fg,,,,o_k so ==
373.76,374.2,Bmr018-c2,s^aa,46b,,,oh that's right .
374.2,375.81,Bmr018-c2,s^bu,47a,,,so the first thing is the automatic thing .
375.76,376.05,Bmr018-c4,s^aa,47b,,,right .
376.225,379.305,Bmr018-c2,s^e,48a,,,and then it's - then it's - then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up .
379.305,380.525,Bmr018-c2,s^e,48a+,,,and then it's i_b_m .
379.439,379.759,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
380.721,381.161,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,48b-1,,,mm-hmm mm-hmm .
380.822,381.072,Bmr018-c4,s^aa,48b-2,,,right .
381.435,384.325,Bmr018-c2,s^cs,,,,o_k so you might as well ha- - run the automatic thing over the entire meeting .
385.09,390.96,Bmr018-c2,s,49a,,,and then - and then uh - you would give i_b_m whatever was fixed .
391.576,393.486,Bmr018-c0,s^e,50a,,,and have them fix it over the entire meeting too .
391.699,391.959,Bmr018-c4,s^aa,49b,,,right .
394.59,396.18,Bmr018-c2,s^aap,50b,,,well yeah but start from the beginning and go to the end .
396.18,396.4,Bmr018-c2,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
396.4,399.49,Bmr018-c2,s,51a,,,so if they were only half way through then that's what you'd give i_b_m .
399.798,400.048,Bmr018-c0,s^bk,51b,,,o_k .
400.414,400.644,Bmr018-c2,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
401.08,402,Bmr018-c1,qw^bu^rt,,,,as of what point ?
405.029,405.429,Bmr018-c1,%--,,,,i mean ==
405.93,411.87,Bmr018-c1,qy^rt,,,,the - i guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i_b_m ?
411.87,413.45,Bmr018-c1,qrr,,,,or do we go ahead and send them a sample ?
413.8,414.59,Bmr018-c2,qw.%-,,,,why wouldn't we s- - w- ?==
414.088,414.658,Bmr018-c1,%-,,,,let their ==
414.71,419.42,Bmr018-c2,qw.%--,,,,i- - if they were going sequentially through it why wouldn't we give them ?==
419.53,422.31,Bmr018-c2,qy,52a,,,i mean i- - are we trying to get something done by the time brian comes ?
422.57,423.89,Bmr018-c1,s^no,52b-1,,,well i - i - i mean i don't know .
423.514,424.774,Bmr018-c4,s,52b-2,,,that was the question though .
425.12,432.26,Bmr018-c2,s,53a,,,so if we - if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to would be better than nothing .
427.32,427.48,Bmr018-c1,b,,,,yeah .
429.479,430.549,Bmr018-c1,s^aa,53b-1,,,uh - that - i agree .
430.919,431.299,Bmr018-c1,s^aa^r,53b-1+,,,i agree .
431.594,432.344,Bmr018-c4,fg|s^no.%-,53b-2,,,well | i don't think ==
432.57,435.6,Bmr018-c4,qy^bu^d^rt,54a,,,i mean h- - they - they typically work for what four hours something like that ?
436,436.87,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,54b,,,hmm i gue- - hmm .
437.163,439.843,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,i think the- - they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting .
441.061,441.611,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,i would think .
441.611,443.291,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,unless it's a lot harder than we think it is .
443.291,444.811,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,which it could be certainly .
445.617,451.144,Bmr018-c0,s.%-,55a,,,if it's got like for speakers then - i guess - i mean if ==
450.57,452.35,Bmr018-c4,s^e,55b,,,or seven or eight .
450.96,452.66,Bmr018-c1,s^bu,56a,,,we're just doing the individual channels .
452.66,452.91,Bmr018-c1,qy^bu^d^g^rt,56a+,,,right ?
453.599,454.869,Bmr018-c0,s^m^rt,56b,,,individual channels .
454.869,455.349,Bmr018-c0,s^aa^rt,56b+,,,yeah .
455.82,458.68,Bmr018-c1,s.%--,,,,so it's gonna be - depending on the number of people in the meeting ==
459.47,459.84,Bmr018-c1,fh,,,,um ==
460.09,467.39,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,i guess there is this issue of you know if - if the segmenter thought there was no speech on - on a particular stretch on a particular channel .
460.64,460.85,Bmr018-c4,fg,,,,well ==
467.39,474.873,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,and there really was then if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify then it might be overlooked .
475.36,481.205,Bmr018-c0,fh|qr,,,,so i mean | the question is should - should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g- - can it be based on the mixed signal ?
481.325,484.755,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,and i th- - eh - so far as i'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point .
484.825,485.205,Bmr018-c0,fh,,,,and ==
484.88,490.39,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,that's what it seems to me too in that if they need to just like in the other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to .
486.33,487.4,Bmr018-c0,s^e,,,,and that cuts down the time .
490.54,490.85,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,yeah .
491.168,492.568,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,but they don't have to for most of it .
493.13,493.59,Bmr018-c0,s^ba,,,,yeah that's good .
493.76,494.18,Bmr018-c0,fh,,,,so yeah .
493.99,495.44,Bmr018-c1,s,,,,i don't see how that will work though .
494.31,494.85,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,good good good .
496.13,496.98,Bmr018-c0,qw^rt,,,,what - what aspect ?
496.53,498.67,Bmr018-c2,s^bu,57a,,,so you're talking about tightening up time boundaries .
498.44,498.7,Bmr018-c1,s^aa,57b,,,yeah .
499.11,504.81,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,so they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each - individual speaker has their own line .
499.18,499.65,Bmr018-c2,qw.%-,,,,so how do you ?==
505.185,505.445,Bmr018-c1,b,,,,yeah .
505.512,508.122,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,but you're listening to the mixed signal and you're tightening the boundaries .
508.752,509.522,Bmr018-c4,s^bsc,,,,correcting the boundaries .
509.522,512.522,Bmr018-c4,s,,,,you shouldn't have to tighten them too much because thilo's program does that .
511.323,512.173,Bmr018-c0,s.x,58a,,,should be pretty good .
512.553,512.843,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,yeah .
512.56,515.72,Bmr018-c3,s^arp,58b,,,except for it doesn't do well on short things remember .
515.25,516.68,Bmr018-c4,fg|s.%-,,,,right | so - so you'll have to i ==
516.05,516.98,Bmr018-c3,s,,,,it will miss them .
516.98,519.08,Bmr018-c3,s^r,,,,it will miss most of the really short things .
519.07,519.33,Bmr018-c4,b,,,,uh-huh .
520.18,520.74,Bmr018-c3,s,,,,like that .
521.04,522.45,Bmr018-c0,s.%-,,,,but those would be - those would be ==
521.362,521.622,Bmr018-c3,s^m,,30=l-=oa.a,,uh-huh .
522.01,523.4,Bmr018-c4,s^bk,,b,,uh-huh .
522.47,523.39,Bmr018-c3,s.%--,,,,it will - it will miss ==
523.48,526.62,Bmr018-c3,s^co.%--,,c,,yeah you have to say uh-huh more slowly to - to get c- ==
525.269,525.679,Bmr018-c4,s^fa,,,laughing after this,sorry .
526.92,527.56,Bmr018-c4,s^cc^j,,,,i'll work on that .
526.93,528.28,Bmr018-c3,s,,,,no i'm s- - i'm actually serious .
528.28,529.91,Bmr018-c3,s.%-,,,,so it will miss stuff like that which ==
529.87,532.97,Bmr018-c4,fg|s,,,,well | so - so that's something that the transcribers will have to - have to do .
529.948,530.108,Bmr018-c1,%-,,,,i ==
532.32,539.4,Bmr018-c0,fg|s,,,,yeah but | presumably most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavil- - heavy overlap section .
539.4,541.42,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,when - in which case they'd be listening to the channels anyway .
539.45,539.85,Bmr018-c3,b,,,,right .
539.63,542.31,Bmr018-c1,s,59a,,,that's - that's what i'm - i'm concerned about the part .
539.85,541.4,Bmr018-c3,s,,,,and that's what i'm not sure about .
542.253,542.563,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,59b,,,yeah .
542.653,543.243,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,59b+,,,i am too .
543.453,545.023,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,and i think it's an empirical question .
544.715,547.195,Bmr018-c1,s.%--,,,,can't we - uh - couldn't we just have um ==
548.4,550.15,Bmr018-c1,s,,,,i don't know maybe this just doesn't fit with the software .
550.15,562.4,Bmr018-c1,s.%-,60a,,,but i guess if i didn't know anything about transcriber and i was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries i would just show them one channel at a time with the marks and let them adju- ==
559.73,560.22,Bmr018-c0,s.%-,,,,oh they can ==
559.948,561.228,Bmr018-c4,s^nd.%--,60b,,,well but then they have to do ==
561.728,566.23,Bmr018-c4,s^nd.x,60b+.61a,,,but then they - for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time and it would probably be more than that .
564.79,565.33,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,61b,,,yeah that's it .
566.66,566.87,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,yeah .
567.58,567.68,Bmr018-c4,qy^d^g,,,,right ?
567.68,572.086,Bmr018-c4,s^df,,,,because they'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through .
571.91,573.7,Bmr018-c1,s,,,,but i- - but it's very quick .
572.31,572.59,Bmr018-c0,%-,,,,and if ==
572.72,573.01,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,uh-huh .
573.81,574.03,Bmr018-c1,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
574.03,576.78,Bmr018-c1,s,,,,i mean you scan - i mean if you have a display of the waveform .
577.16,578.2,Bmr018-c4,s^bu,62a,,,oh you're talking about visually .
577.32,577.5,Bmr018-c0,b,,,,yeah .
578.2,579.15,Bmr018-c4,s^nd.%-,,,,i just don't think ==
578.23,580.65,Bmr018-c0,fg|s^arp,62b,,,w- - well | the other problem is the breaths .
580.65,582.35,Bmr018-c0,s^df,,,,cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform .
582.35,585.7,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,i've - i've looked at the int- - uh - s- - i've tried to do that with a single channel .
585.919,589.769,Bmr018-c0,s,,,,and - and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice .
586.16,586.46,Bmr018-c1,b,,,,uh-huh .
590.287,594.057,Bmr018-c4,s,63a,,,yeah and i - i think that they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .
595.06,596.15,Bmr018-c0,s^am,63b,,,well that - that i'm not sure .
595.48,595.74,Bmr018-c4,fh,,,,so ==
596.15,599.15,Bmr018-c0,qy^bu^rt,,,,what you - the digital - what the digital task that you had - your interface ?
599.612,606.562,Bmr018-c0,fh|s,1a,,,um - | i know for a fact that one of those - sh- - she could really well - she could judge what th- - what the number was based on the - on the waveform .
