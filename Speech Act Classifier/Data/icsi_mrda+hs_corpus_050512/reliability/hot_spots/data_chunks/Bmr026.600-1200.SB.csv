604.294,607.473,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,it'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .
605.799,606.579,Bmr026-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
606.163,606.573,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,mmm .
612.03,615.56,Bmr026-c0,s^tc,,,,and the last i- - item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .
615.56,617.83,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,so we're doing o_k on backed up .
617.88,621.66,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,we're - we're only about thirty percent on the second disk .
622.35,626.36,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,so uh - we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical .
626.36,632.05,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,but we are like ninety five percent ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .
632.362,632.512,Bmr026-c2,b,,,,yeah .
633.17,637.73,Bmr026-c0,s^rt,,,,and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space .
637.73,644.55,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once in a lot of different ways .
644.669,644.889,Bmr026-c2,b,,,,yeah .
644.68,646.04,Bmr026-c5,s,1a,,,oh there's a lot of transcribers too .
646.305,647.355,Bmr026-c0,s^bk|s^m,1b,,,yeah | there're a lot of transcribers .
646.545,646.735,Bmr026-c2,b,,,,yeah .
647.355,649.085,Bmr026-c0,s^cs,,,,so all of those need to be expanded .
648.968,649.398,Bmr026-c5,b,,,,mm-hmm .
649.085,657.07,Bmr026-c0,s^rt^t,,,,and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh - uh - uh - the permission forms .
650.153,650.473,Bmr026-c2,%-,,,,an- ==
653.47,653.74,Bmr026-c5,b,,,,right .
657.07,660.29,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,so i want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around .
661.19,665.83,Bmr026-c0,fh|s,,,,um - | and jane was gonna talk to uh - dave johnson about it .
665.83,668.49,Bmr026-c0,s.%--,,,,one of the things i was thinking is we - we just got these hundred ==
668.68,669.3,Bmr026-c0,s^fa,,,,alright excuse me .
669.3,674.8,Bmr026-c0,s,3a,,,ten uh - sparc-blade sun-blades .
672.802,673.372,Bmr026-c1,qy^rt,2a,,,did they come in ?
673.65,674.08,Bmr026-c5,s^r,3b,,,sun-blades .
674.08,674.23,Bmr026-c5,s^aa,,,,yeah .
674.272,674.602,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,yeah .
674.38,675.13,Bmr026-c5,s,4a,,,they came in the other day .
674.92,676.53,Bmr026-c0,s^r,,,,they came in but they're not set up yet .
675.55,675.8,Bmr026-c1,s^bk,4b,,,oh .
676.53,681.6,Bmr026-c0,s^cs,5a,,,and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room .
681.6,684.44,Bmr026-c0,s^e,,,,they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .
684.91,688.08,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,and if we just need un-backed-up space we could just hang disks off them .
688.26,689.47,Bmr026-c5,qy.%--,,,,well is there ?==
689.47,690.92,Bmr026-c5,qw^cs^nd,5b.6a,,,why not just hang them off of abbott ?
690.92,691.41,Bmr026-c5,qy.%-,,,,is there a ?==
691.502,691.752,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
691.65,694.35,Bmr026-c0,s,6b.7a.8a,,,because there's no more room in the disk racks on abbott .
693,693.38,Bmr026-c5,s^bk,7a,,,ah .
694.72,695.41,Bmr026-c5,s^bk,7a+,,,ah i see .
695.201,695.871,Bmr026-c1,qy^bu.%--,,,,weren't we gonna get ?==
695.901,697.591,Bmr026-c1,s^cs,8b,,,well maybe it should get another rack .
696.68,698.6,Bmr026-c3,s,9a,,,but you still need to store the disks somehow .
699.69,702.05,Bmr026-c0,s,9b,,,well but the sun-blades have spare drive bays .
699.785,700.045,Bmr026-c3,%-,,,,so ==
703.72,704.9,Bmr026-c5,s^cs.%--,,,,you can put two ==
703.96,704.68,Bmr026-c0,s^co,,,,just put them in .

709.106,709.336,Bmr026-c3,s^bk,11b,,,oh .
709.14,711.96,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,cuz the sun - uh - these sun-blades take commodity hard drives .
711.96,715.88,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,so you can just go out and buy a p_c hard drive and stick it in .
714.66,715.1,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,mmm .
716.148,724.368,Bmr026-c1,s^cs,12a,,,but if abbott is going to be our disk server it - it - file server it seems like we would want to get it uh - a second disk rack or something .
725.6,728.34,Bmr026-c3,s^e^rt,12b.12.5a,,,plus we're talking about buying a second dis- - uh - file server .

919.57,919.74,Bmr026-c5,b,,,,yeah .
919.74,924.9,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,well i sent that message out to i guess you and dave asking for - if we could get some disk .
922.511,922.821,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
924.9,927.66,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,i s- - i sent this out a - a day ago .
925.467,926.257,Bmr026-c0,qw,,,,and put it where ?
925.799,926.059,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,right .
927.66,932.066,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,but - and dave didn't respond so i don- - i don't know how the whole process works .
932.066,934.926,Bmr026-c5,qy.%--,,,,i mean does he just go out and get them and - if it's o_k and ?==
934.17,934.31,Bmr026-c0,b,,,,yep .
935.81,937.79,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,so i was assuming he was gonna take over that .
937.79,939.82,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving .
939.774,941.814,Bmr026-c1,s^cs,,,,yeah i think you need a direct conversation with him .
941.994,944.934,Bmr026-c1,s^cs:qw,,,,and just say an-e- - just ask him that you know wha- - what should you do .
945.474,947.964,Bmr026-c1,s:qy,,,,and in my answer back was are you sure you just want one .
948.124,955.854,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure well here's what we pi- - figure on doing for the next few months .
948.473,948.663,Bmr026-c5,b,,,,yeah .
955.252,956.642,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,wa- - a- - i know what they want .
956.842,960.632,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .
961.035,961.325,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
961.082,963.312,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,so they don't want to stack up external drives .
963.97,966.53,Bmr026-c0,fh|s,,,,um - | and then they want everything else in the machine room .
967.629,967.849,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,right .
968.9,970.46,Bmr026-c0,qw,,,,so the question is where are you gonna hang them ?
971.154,971.694,Bmr026-c5,b,,,,mm-hmm .
972.22,974.46,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .
974.792,975.042,Bmr026-c0,b,,,,right .
975.718,976.028,Bmr026-c5,%-,,,,so ==
978.038,978.258,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,right .
978.258,981.158,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,so this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave .
978.334,978.734,Bmr026-c3,%-,,,,<o_k> th- - the ==
980.32,986.25,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,i think part of the reason why dave can't get the - the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .
981.218,981.588,Bmr026-c1,s^df.%-,,,,cuz it ==
982.78,983.02,Bmr026-c3,%-,,,,one ==
983.71,983.91,Bmr026-c3,%,,,,mmm .
985.367,985.537,Bmr026-c0,b,,,,yep .
985.79,992.131,Bmr026-c3,s.%--,,,,one - one - on- - one thing to in- - to um - t- - to do when you need to conserve space is ==
986.25,987.62,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,so he has to re-arrange a bunch of stuff .
992.718,997.18,Bmr026-c3,s,,,,i bet there are still some old uh - like nine gig disks uh - around .
997.18,999.66,Bmr026-c3,s,,,,and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks .
999.66,1001.77,Bmr026-c3,s,,,,and - and you know recover the space .
1001.82,1002.05,Bmr026-c0,b,,,,yep .
1002.68,1002.77,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1002.77,1002.9,Bmr026-c1,fg,,,,no .
1002.9,1005.08,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,i think dave - dave knows all these things of course .
1004.82,1005.09,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,right .
1005.08,1012.27,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,an- - and so he always has a- - a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an- - and runs out of time .
1010.29,1010.75,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1010.79,1015.1,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,but i - i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .
1015.1,1022.6,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh - the back - the back up system rather than on new disk .
1017.85,1018.2,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,mmm .
1022.07,1022.33,Bmr026-c3,b,,,,mmm .
1022.86,1023.1,Bmr026-c0,fh,,,,so ==
1025.84,1026.14,Bmr026-c1,fg,,,,well .
1026.14,1026.29,Bmr026-c1,s.%--,,,,so ==
1026.25,1026.52,Bmr026-c0,%-,,,,which ==
1026.29,1028.29,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,but this - this is a very specific question for me .
1028.29,1032.22,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,basically we can easily get one to four disks .
1032.22,1034.5,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,i mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it .
1034.5,1035.31,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,it's no big deal .
1035.95,1037.77,Bmr026-c1,fh|qo,,,,uh - | but the question is where they go ?
1038.08,1039.28,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,and i don't think we can solve that here .
1039.17,1041.77,Bmr026-c3,s^cs,3a,,,maybe we can put some disks in the - in that back room there .
1039.28,1040.12,Bmr026-c1,s^cs,,,,you just have to ask him .
1042.07,1042.48,Bmr026-c0,s^aa,3b,,small chortles after this,yeah really .
1044.27,1045.11,Bmr026-c1,s.%-,4a,,,attach to ==
1045.66,1046.15,Bmr026-c0,s,,,,popcorn .
1046.56,1047.9,Bmr026-c3,s^2^rt,,,,to the machine that collects the data .
1046.64,1046.91,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1048.14,1050.87,Bmr026-c3,s^rt,5a,,,so then you could at least temporarily store stuff there .
1051.39,1051.8,Bmr026-c3,%-,,,,the only ==
1051.41,1051.67,Bmr026-c5,b.%,,,,hmm .
1051.44,1054.52,Bmr026-c0,s^arp,5b.6a,,,yeah it's just - it's not on the net so it's a little awkward .
1053.85,1054.85,Bmr026-c3,qw^bu,6b.7a,,,what do you mean it's not on the net ?
1055.05,1055.63,Bmr026-c0,s.%--,,,,it's not ==
1055.15,1055.74,Bmr026-c2,s,,,,it's not bad .
1056.28,1060.24,Bmr026-c0,s,7b,,,it's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except s_s_h .
1058.78,1061.19,Bmr026-c3,qy^bu^d^rt,8a,,,oh because it's - because it's an aciri machine ?
1060.85,1061.11,Bmr026-c0,s^aa,8b.9a,,,yep .
1061.19,1062.3,Bmr026-c3,s^bk,9b,,,oh oh oh .
1061.29,1061.57,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1062.34,1065.02,Bmr026-c0,s,10a,,,and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net .
1065.1,1067.54,Bmr026-c0,qh,,,,but who knows when that will happen ?
1067.66,1070.44,Bmr026-c5,s,,,,that might be a good short term solution though .
1068.08,1069.19,Bmr026-c3,s,10b,40=l=a;c.a,,but that can't be that hard .
1069.19,1069.48,Bmr026-c3,fh,,,,i mean ==
1070.02,1077.59,Bmr026-c0,s,,b,,no the - the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers .
1078.06,1078.55,Bmr026-c3,%-,,,,oh ==
1078.79,1081.4,Bmr026-c0,s,,c,,so they actually have to run a wire somewhere .
1081.84,1082.01,Bmr026-c1,fg,,,,yeah .
1082.87,1086.7,Bmr026-c1,s,11a,,,yeah e- - again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .
1086.7,1093.44,Bmr026-c1,s.%-,,,,if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's - it's - jus- - every- - ever- - everybody - everybody has a - has ==
1090.78,1092.13,Bmr026-c0,s^arp,11b.12a,,,but dave has to do all of them .
1093.8,1096.34,Bmr026-c1,s^nd,12b,,,well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing .
1097.29,1101.06,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,but at any rate i think that there's a - there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need .
1101.06,1103.17,Bmr026-c1,s^cs.%--,,,,and i think we need a - a conversation with ==
1103.96,1109.49,Bmr026-c1,fh|s^cs.x,,,,uh - | maybe - maybe after - after tea or something you and i can go down and - and talk to him about it .
1110.04,1111.66,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,just say wha- - you know what should we do right now .
1112.3,1113.41,Bmr026-c5,qw^rt,13a,,,how long is david gonna be gone ?
1114.29,1116.32,Bmr026-c1,h|s^rt,13b.14a.15a,,,uh - | eleven days or something .
1116.96,1117.24,Bmr026-c0,s^fe,14b,,,oh my !
1120.67,1120.73,Bmr026-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1120.73,1124.32,Bmr026-c1,s^e,15b,,,basically tomorrow and all of the week after .
1126.56,1127.23,Bmr026-c0,s^rt^tc,,,,and that's all i have .
1128.56,1128.92,Bmr026-c1,fg,,,,um ==
1129.74,1130.12,Bmr026-c1,h,,,,let's see .
1130.12,1135.7,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,the only oth- - thing - other thing i was gonna add was that um - uh - i talked briefly to mari .
1135.78,1143.07,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,and uh - we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here .
1143.44,1147.78,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next .
1148.31,1153.73,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,and i - i - i wanted to make it um - after the next one of these meetings .
1153.73,1168.18,Bmr026-c1,s,,,giggling after this,so something that we wanna do next meeting is - is uh - to put together um - a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it um - that we've done .
1169.05,1176.16,Bmr026-c1,s,,,,i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o- - e- - do- - do- - i can - i can dream up text but this is basically gonna lead to the annual report .
1176.6,1178.72,Bmr026-c1,fh|%-,,,,so um - | if w- ==
1176.79,1177.1,Bmr026-c3,b.%,,,,mm-hmm .
1178.34,1179.17,Bmr026-c0,qy^bu^d^rt,16a,,,this is the fifteenth ?
1181.39,1182.41,Bmr026-c1,h|%-,,,,um - | that would ==
1181.72,1182.8,Bmr026-c0,qy^bu^d^rt,16a+,,,so just a week from tomorrow ?
1183.05,1183.33,Bmr026-c1,s^aa,16b.17a,,,yeah .
1183.46,1183.69,Bmr026-c0,s^bk,17b,,,o_k .
1184.01,1184.22,Bmr026-c1,fh,,,,yeah .
1184.91,1186.15,Bmr026-c1,fh|%--,,,,so uh - | we can ==
1186.39,1186.57,Bmr026-c1,%-,,,,this ==
1186.49,1187.81,Bmr026-c3,qy^rt,,,,is this gotta be in the morning ?
1186.57,1187.05,Bmr026-c1,%-,,,,so that's an ==
1189.28,1189.63,Bmr026-c1,h,,,,um ==
1189.44,1189.69,Bmr026-c3,%--,,,,or ==
1189.82,1194.69,Bmr026-c3,s,,,,because you know i - fridays i have to leave uh - like around uh - two .
1196.81,1198.94,Bmr026-c3,s^cs.%-,,,,so if it could be before that would be be- ==
1198.21,1200.73,Bmr026-c1,s^nd,18b.19a,,,no no but i - i - i don't need other folks for the meeting .
