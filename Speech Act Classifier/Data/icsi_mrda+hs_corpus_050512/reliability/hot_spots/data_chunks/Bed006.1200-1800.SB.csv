1202.34,1202.57,Bed006-cA,b,,,,uh-huh .
1204.32,1204.63,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1205.22,1206.23,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,and ==
1207.36,1211.48,Bed006-c2,s^cs,2a,,,you can speak into it and ask for t_v and movie information .
1208.86,1209.16,Bed006-c4,s^ba,2b,,,toll .
1211.48,1212.06,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,and then when ==
1212.35,1217.27,Bed006-c2,s,3a,,,if - if something actually happens and some answers come out then we're done .
1217.38,1217.63,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1220.03,1222.19,Bed006-cA,s^2,3b.4a,,,if - and they're kind of correct .
1220.9,1221.93,Bed006-c4,s^bs,,,,so it's not done basically .
1222.5,1223.08,Bed006-c2,qw^br,4b.5a,,,hmm ?
1222.96,1224.51,Bed006-cA,s,5b.6a,10=l-=a;g.a,,and they kind of are - are correct .
1223.69,1223.91,Bed006-c4,s^bk,6b,b.c,,right .
1225.05,1226.21,Bed006-cA,s^e,7a,,,it's not just like anything .
1225.38,1228.05,Bed006-c4,s,7b,,,perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example .
1227.12,1228.31,Bed006-cA,s^e,,,,and they're mostly in english .
1228.73,1228.95,Bed006-cA,fh.x,,,,so ==
1230.1,1230.7,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,then um ==
1230.56,1231.98,Bed006-cA,qy^rt,8a,,,are they - is it using the database ?
1231.98,1233.83,Bed006-cA,s^e,8a+,,,the german t_v movie .
1233.96,1234.14,Bed006-c2,s^aa,8b.9a,20=l=a;c.a,,yeah .
1234.36,1234.62,Bed006-cA,s^bk,9b,,,o_k .
1234.62,1238.67,Bed006-cA,s,9b+.10a,b,,so all the actual data might be german names .
1238.24,1240.22,Bed006-c2,fh,10b,,,um - well actually th- - um ==
1240.02,1241.6,Bed006-cA,qrr,9b++,b,,or are they all like american t_v programs ?
1242.45,1243.51,Bed006-c2,%-,,,,um - well ==
1243.23,1244.91,Bed006-c4,s^j,,b.e,,i want to see die dukes von hazard {@reject@} .
1247.52,1247.89,Bed006-c2,%-,,,,the ==
1249.21,1254.98,Bed006-c2,fg|s,,,,o_k | so you don't know how the german dialogue - uh - the german - the demo dialogue actually works .
1254.98,1255.35,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,it works ==
1255.35,1258.63,Bed006-c2,s,,,,the first thing is what's you know showing on t_v .
1259.16,1262.87,Bed006-c2,s^rt,,,,and then the person is presented with what's running on t_v .
1263.22,1265.57,Bed006-c2,s^e,,,,in germany on that day on that evening .
1264.07,1264.65,Bed006-cA,b^rt,,,,mm-hmm .
1264.84,1265.28,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1266.34,1270.44,Bed006-c2,s:s^ba,,,,and so you take one look at it and then you say well that's really nothing - there's nothing for me there .
1270.98,1272.66,Bed006-c2,qh,,,,what's running in the cinemas ?
1272.54,1273.03,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1272.8,1274.36,Bed006-c2,s^rt,,,,so maybe there's something better happening there .
1274.79,1278.27,Bed006-c2,s^rt,,,,and then you get - you're shown what movies play which films .
1278.66,1283.37,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and it's gonna be of course all the heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing .
1282.79,1283.1,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1283.88,1286.37,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and most of them are going to be hollywood movies .
1286.67,1287.01,Bed006-cA,b,,,,hmm .
1286.79,1288.34,Bed006-c2,s,11a,,,so american beauty is american beauty .
1288.73,1288.99,Bed006-c2,qy^d^f^g^rt,11a+,,,right ?
1288.99,1289.33,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,yeah .
1289.04,1289.39,Bed006-c4,x,,,,mm-hmm .
1289.39,1289.65,Bed006-cA,s^aa,11b,,,right .
1290.53,1291.27,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,and um ==
1292.38,1293.64,Bed006-cA,s^bu^rt,12a,,,but they're shown like on a screen .
1293.69,1296.17,Bed006-cA,qy^bu.%--,12a+,,,it's a - i mean so would the generator ?==
1294.1,1294.84,Bed006-c2,%--,,,,n- ==
1296.17,1301.94,Bed006-cA,s^bu:s,12a++,,,like the english language sentence of it is these are the follow- - you know the following films are being shown or something like that .
1301.63,1306.76,Bed006-c2,s^aa|s^nd,12b.13a,,,yeah | but it in that sense it doesn't make - in that case uh - it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud .
1302.42,1302.72,Bed006-cA,%-,,,,s- ==
1306.85,1307.13,Bed006-cA,s^bk,13b,,,right .
1307.3,1308.26,Bed006-cA,s.%--,,,,so it'll just display ==
1307.39,1308.13,Bed006-c2,s^e,,,,if you're displaying them .
1308.57,1308.8,Bed006-cA,s^bk,,,,o_k .
1309.29,1310.72,Bed006-cA,s.%-,,,,so we don't have to worry about um ==
1309.51,1313.47,Bed006-c2,s,,,,but uh - it'll tell you that this is what's showing in heidelberg and there you go .
1312.46,1312.63,Bed006-cA,b,,,,yeah .
1313.47,1316.03,Bed006-c2,s:s^fe,,,,and the presentation agent will go nuh .
1313.84,1314.08,Bed006-cA,b,,,,o_k .
1316.66,1317.93,Bed006-c2,s,,,,like that - the avatar .
1317.2,1317.44,Bed006-cA,b,,,,o_k .
1318.74,1319.88,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,and um ==
1320.74,1324.49,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and then you pick - pick a movie and - and - and it show- - shows you the times .
1324.49,1325.21,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and you pick a time .
1325.21,1326.62,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and you pick seats and all of this .
1326.62,1326.75,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,so ==
1327.56,1327.69,Bed006-cA,b,,,,o_k .
1329.93,1330.71,Bed006-c2,s^ba,,,,pretty straightforward .
1331.24,1331.5,Bed006-c4,b,,,,o_k .
1333.76,1337.39,Bed006-c2,s^ba,14a,,,but it's - so this time we - we are at an advantage .
1337.39,1341.54,Bed006-c2,s^df,14a+,,,because it was a problem for the german system to incorporate all these english movie titles .
1341.53,1341.74,Bed006-cA,b,,,,yeah .
1342.28,1342.48,Bed006-c2,qy^d^f^g^rt,14a++,,,nuh ?
1342.78,1343.09,Bed006-cA,s^bk,14b,,,right .
1343.05,1345.15,Bed006-c2,s^ba,,,,but in english that's not really a problem .
1345.18,1345.5,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1345.99,1351.73,Bed006-c2,s^df,,,,unless we get some - some topical german movies that have just come out and that are in their database .
1352.14,1352.36,Bed006-cA,b,,,,right .
1352.57,1357.18,Bed006-c2,s,15a,,,so the person may select huehner rennen or whatever .
1357.48,1357.94,Bed006-c4,s,15b,,,chicken run .
1360.6,1360.98,Bed006-c2,s^bk^rt^tc,,,,o_k .
1362.07,1363.97,Bed006-c2,s^t^tc,16a,,,then uh - on to the modeling .
1365.62,1365.89,Bed006-c2,qy^d^g^rt,16a+,,,right ?
1366.98,1368.22,Bed006-c1,s,16b,,,yeah yeah i guess .
1369.32,1371.16,Bed006-c2,fh|s^t1,,,,um - | then modeling .
1372.92,1373.28,Bed006-c2,s^t1,,,,there it is .
1375.01,1376.08,Bed006-c4,fg|qw,,,,o_k | what's the next thing ?
1375.38,1375.78,Bed006-c1,b,,,,yep .
1375.78,1375.93,Bed006-c1,%,,,,e- ==
1380.16,1386.11,Bed006-c2,s,,,,this is very rough but this is sort of what um - johno and i managed to come up with .
1387.86,1389.33,Bed006-c2,s.%-,,,,the idea here is that ==
1390.28,1394.51,Bed006-c1,s,17a,,,this is the uh - s- - the schema of the x_m_l here .
1394.51,1396.84,Bed006-c1,s^e,17a+,,,not an example or something like that .
1396.13,1397.07,Bed006-c2,s^aa|s^m,17b-1,,,yeah | this is not an x_m_l .
1396.88,1397.14,Bed006-c4,s^bk,17b-2,,,o_k .
1397.07,1398.82,Bed006-c2,s^e,,,,this is sort of towards an - a schema .
1399.3,1399.48,Bed006-c2,qy^d^f^g,,,,nuh ?
1399.35,1399.51,Bed006-c0,b,,,,right .
1400.06,1400.67,Bed006-c2,s^e,,,,definition .
1401.3,1406.71,Bed006-c2,s,,,,the idea is - so imagine we have a library of schema .
1407.21,1409.56,Bed006-c2,s,,,,such as the source-path-goal .
1410.03,1413.27,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and then we have forced uh - motion .
1413.74,1415.62,Bed006-c2,s,,,,we have cost action .
1414.31,1414.61,Bed006-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1416.28,1416.57,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1416.5,1417.88,Bed006-c2,s,,,,we have a whole library of schemas .
1419.08,1423.35,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and they're gonna be you know fleshed out in - in their real ugly detail .
1423.67,1424.63,Bed006-c2,s^rt,,,,source-path-goal .
1424.63,1429.78,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and there's gonna be s- - a lot of stuff on the goal and blah-blah-blah that a goal can be and so forth .
1430.45,1432.3,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,what we think is ==
1433.06,1435.83,Bed006-c2,s^cs,,,,and all the names could - should be taken cum grano salis .
1435.89,1436.1,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,so ==
1436.43,1437.16,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,this is a ==
1437.77,1443.93,Bed006-c2,s,,,,the fact that we're calling this action schema right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this action schema .
1443.93,1449.77,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,but what that means is we have here first of all ==
1450.09,1454.93,Bed006-c2,s,18a,,,on the - in the - in the first iteration a stupid list of source-path-goal actions .
1455.66,1457.44,Bed006-c1,s^2.%--,18b.19a,,,actions that can be categorized with ==
1457.85,1459.37,Bed006-c1,s^2,18b+.19a+,,,or that are related to source-path-goal .
1457.89,1458.24,Bed006-c2,%-,,,,wi- ==
1459.54,1459.76,Bed006-c4,s^bk,19b-1,,,o_k .
1459.91,1460.54,Bed006-c2,s^2,19b-2,,,to that schema .
1461.26,1461.63,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1462.12,1466.72,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions .
1467.42,1472.4,Bed006-c1,s,,,,and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary .
1472.77,1477.67,Bed006-c2,s,,,,so a push may be in - in - in both you know push uh - in this or this .
1478.07,1480.14,Bed006-cA,s^bu,20a,,,forced motion and caused action for instance .
1478.24,1478.4,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,uh ==
1479.77,1480.16,Bed006-c2,s^aa,20b.21a,,,exactly .
1480.14,1480.35,Bed006-cA,s^bk,21b,,,o_k .
1480.55,1480.67,Bed006-c2,b,,,,yeah .
1481.78,1488.65,Bed006-c2,fg|s,,,,also | these things may or may not get their own structure in the future .
1489.36,1494.21,Bed006-c2,s,,,,so this is something that you know may also be a res- - as a result of your work .
1494.35,1499.63,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,in the future we may find out that you know there're really s- - these subtle differences between ==
1500.19,1500.76,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,um ==
1501.2,1510.27,Bed006-c2,s,,,,even within the domain of entering in the light of a source-path-goal schema that we need to put in - fill in additional structure up there .
1512.03,1513.86,Bed006-c2,s^ba,,,,but it gives us a nice handle .
1513.86,1519.54,Bed006-c2,s,,,,so with this we can basically um - you know s- - slaughter the cow any- - anyway we want .
1520.29,1520.75,Bed006-c2,fh,,,,uh ==
1522.21,1525.9,Bed006-c2,s,,,,it - it is - it was sort of a - it gave us some headache .
1525.9,1530.22,Bed006-c2,qr,,,,how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the enter source-path-goal ?
1530.22,1533.56,Bed006-c2,s,,,,that this - but this sort of gets the job done in that respect .
1533.56,1540.72,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um - we're talking about two different things .
1540.72,1544.18,Bed006-c2,s,,,,we're talking more on the sort of intention level up there .
1544.69,1550.34,Bed006-c2,s,,,,and more on the - this is the - your basic bone um - schema down there .
1551.83,1552.88,Bed006-c1,s,22a,,,uh - one question robert .
1552.88,1556.34,Bed006-c1,qy,22a+,,,when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i'm supposed to look at ?
1555.66,1556.89,Bed006-cA,s^aa|s,22b.23a,,,yeah | it's the shadow .
1556.34,1556.7,Bed006-c1,s^bk,23b,,,o_k .
1557.17,1559.06,Bed006-c1,s,24a,,,whereas - i keep looking where your hand is .
1560.05,1560.63,Bed006-c1,s.%-,,,,and it doesn't ==
1560.21,1561.77,Bed006-c2,s,24b.25a,,,well that wouldn't have helped you at all .
1561.69,1562.06,Bed006-cA,b.%,,,,right .
1561.74,1562,Bed006-c1,s^bk,25b,,,yeah .
1563.14,1568.66,Bed006-c1,s,,,,basically what this is - is that there's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner .
1563.91,1564.65,Bed006-c4,s^t1,,,,spit right here .
1569.73,1579.25,Bed006-c1,s,,,,and right now the way the interface is action go and then they have the - what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on .
1579.39,1579.82,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1579.91,1589.5,Bed006-c1,s,,,,and the problem is is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type going into goes of type want to go to a place where i can take a picture of et cetera .
1590.07,1591.53,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,so this is sort of what it looks like ==
1591.53,1601.37,Bed006-c2,s,26a,,,now some simple go action from it - from an object named peter's kirche of the type church to an object named powder-tower of the type tower .
1602.91,1605.28,Bed006-cA,qy^bu^d^rt,26b.27a,,,this is the - uh - what the action planner uses ?
1603.05,1603.21,Bed006-c2,qy^d^f^g,26a+,,,right ?
1605.48,1605.81,Bed006-cA,s.%-,,,,this is ==
1605.55,1606.14,Bed006-c1,s^aa|s^aap,27b-1.28a,,,right | currently .
1605.81,1606.19,Bed006-cA,s^bk,28b,,,o_k .
1606.44,1606.82,Bed006-c2,s^aap,27b-2,,,currently .
1606.47,1608.86,Bed006-cA,qy^bu^d^rt,29a,,,and is that - and tha- - that's changeable ?
1609.39,1609.82,Bed006-cA,qrr,29a+,,,or not ?
1610.08,1610.5,Bed006-c2,s^bk|%-,29b,,,yeah | well ==
1610.55,1611.83,Bed006-cA,qy^e^rt,30a,,,like are we adapting to it ?
1612.45,1612.9,Bed006-cA,qrr.%--,,,,or ?==
1612.51,1612.75,Bed006-c2,s^ar,30b,,,no .
1613.13,1617.09,Bed006-c2,s,,,,we - this is the output sort of of the natural language understanding .
1613.25,1613.43,Bed006-cA,b,,,,oh yeah .
1617.02,1617.42,Bed006-cA,b,,,,uh-huh .
1617.23,1617.55,Bed006-c2,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,,right ?
1618.07,1621.09,Bed006-c2,s,,,,the input into the action planning as it is now .
1619.46,1619.84,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1621.22,1621.55,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1622.45,1623.83,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,and what we are going to do ==
1623.83,1624.77,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,we going to ==
1625.23,1626.34,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,and you can see here ==
1626.8,1629.46,Bed006-c2,s^co,31a,30=l=g.a,,and again for johno please - please focus the shadow .
1629.74,1630.34,Bed006-c1,s^bk,31b,b.c,,o_k .
1630.44,1631.71,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,um - we're gon- ==

1631.97,1635.35,Bed006-c2,s,,,,here you have the action and the domain object .

1641.4,1644.26,Bed006-c2,s|s.%-,,,,yeah | i - i um - have - i have no ==
1643.94,1645.1,Bed006-c1,s,,,,robert likes to be abstract .
1645.1,1646.63,Bed006-c1,s,,,,and that's what i just thought he was doing .
1647.04,1647.87,Bed006-cA,s,,,,you look up here .
1648.43,1648.68,Bed006-cA,s^bk,,,,o_k .
1648.54,1651.19,Bed006-c2,s,,,,sort of between here and here .
1651.43,1664.73,Bed006-c2,s,,,,so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um - struct if you want i_e a rich action description on that level .
1655.24,1655.6,Bed006-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1665.4,1666.09,Bed006-c2,s.%-,,,,so in the future ==
1665.46,1667.04,Bed006-cA,s^bu.%-,32a,,,so it's just an additional information ==
1667.84,1668.26,Bed006-c2,s^aa,32b,,,exactly .
1668.26,1676.46,Bed006-c2,s,33a,,,in the future though the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an - an action and a domain object but an action a domain object and a rich action description .
1668.28,1668.55,Bed006-cA,b,,,,right .
1668.55,1670.44,Bed006-cA,s^e,,,,that doesn't hurt the current way .
1672.05,1672.41,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1676.45,1676.76,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1678.09,1678.47,Bed006-c2,%--,,,,which is ==
1678.12,1680.05,Bed006-c1,s^2,33b.34a,50=l-=o.a,,which - which we're abbreviating as rad .
1678.82,1678.95,Bed006-cA,b,,,,good .
1681.09,1682.11,Bed006-cA,b,,,,hmm .
1681.23,1681.68,Bed006-c4,s^ba^fe,34b,b.c,,rad !
1683.2,1686.56,Bed006-c5,fg|s,35a,,,so um - | you had like an action schema and a source-path-goal schema .
1683.23,1684.14,Bed006-cA,b,,,,hmm .
1684.89,1685.05,Bed006-cA,b,,,,hmm .
1685.2,1685.53,Bed006-cA,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1686.56,1686.78,Bed006-c5,qy^d^f^g^rt,35a+,,,right ?
1686.78,1690.08,Bed006-c5,qw,35a++,,,so how does this source-path-goal schema fit into the uh - action schema ?
1690.37,1691.52,Bed006-c5,qy^e^rt,35a+++,,,like is it one of the tags there ?
1690.74,1691.87,Bed006-cA,s^bk|qy^rt,35b,,,yeah | can you go back to that one ?
1694.04,1695.84,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,so the source-path-goal schema in this case ==
1695.96,1699.07,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,i've - if i understand how we described - we set this up ==
1699.9,1700.87,Bed006-c1,fh,,,,um ==
1700.87,1702.47,Bed006-c1,s,,,,cuz we've been arguing about it all week .
1704.71,1707.62,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,but uh - we'll hold the - the ==
1709.35,1715.6,Bed006-c1,s,,,,well in this case it will hold the - i mean the - the features i guess .
1715.6,1717.28,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,i'm not - it's hard for me to exactly s- ==
1717.28,1720.54,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,so basically that will store the - the object that is w- ==
1720.86,1722.94,Bed006-c1,s^rt,36a,,,the source will store the object that we're going from .
1723.49,1723.9,Bed006-c4,b,,,,mm-hmm .
1723.86,1726.06,Bed006-c1,s.%-,,,,the goal will store the - the f- ==
1724.51,1726.7,Bed006-cA,s,36b.37a,,,so the fillers of the role source .
1726.06,1727.43,Bed006-c1,s,37b.38a,,,we'll fill those in - fill those roles in .
1727.13,1727.48,Bed006-cA,s^bk,38b.39a,,,o_k .
1727.43,1727.72,Bed006-c1,qy^d^g^rt,38b+.39a+,,,right ?
1727.75,1727.94,Bed006-c2,s^aa,39b,,,yeah .
1728.42,1731.92,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,the s- - action-schemas basically have extra ==
1732.62,1734.33,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,see we - so those are - schemas exist ==
1734.33,1736.6,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,,because in case we need extra information ==
1737.93,1747.45,Bed006-c1,s,,,,instead of just making it an attribute and which - which is just one thing we - we decided to make it's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that - that we need to exploit .
1747.85,1748.5,Bed006-cA,fg|s.%--,,,,o_k | so th- ==
1748.5,1749.24,Bed006-cA,s^fa|s^df.%--,,,,sorry | i just don't kn- ==
1749.24,1750.34,Bed006-cA,fh,,,,um - um - um ==
1750.34,1752.59,Bed006-cA,s,,,,this is just uh - x_m_l mo- - notational .
1752.59,1756.4,Bed006-cA,s,40a,,,but um - the fact that it's action schema and then sort of slash action schema .
1756.4,1757.84,Bed006-cA,s.%--,40a+,,,that's a whole entit- ==
1757.41,1757.95,Bed006-c1,s,40b.41a,,,that's a block .
1757.91,1758.45,Bed006-cA,s^bk^m,41b,,,that's a block .
1757.95,1758.24,Bed006-c1,b,,,,yeah .
1758.72,1760.71,Bed006-cA,qy^bu^d^rt,42a,,,whereas source is just an attribute ?
1760.71,1761.05,Bed006-cA,qy.%-,42a+,,,is that ?==
1761.07,1761.56,Bed006-c2,s^ar,42b.43a,,,no no no .
1761.56,1763.44,Bed006-c2,s,42b+.43a+,,,source is just not spelled out here .
1763.68,1764.55,Bed006-cA,s^bk,43b,,,oh o_k o_k .
1763.85,1771.48,Bed006-c2,s,44a,,,source meaning - source will be uh - will have a name a type maybe a dimensionality .
1771.19,1771.91,Bed006-cA,b,,,,uh-huh uh-huh .
1771.48,1775.16,Bed006-c2,s.%-,44a+,,,maybe canonical uh - orientation ==
1774.19,1776.92,Bed006-cA,s^bk|s.%-,44b.45a,,,o_k | could it - it could also be blocked out then as ==
1776.47,1776.72,Bed006-c1,s^aa,45b,,,yeah .
1776.72,1777.41,Bed006-c1,%--,45b+,,,the - so ==
1776.92,1777.26,Bed006-cA,b,,,,o_k .
1777.7,1777.95,Bed006-c1,s^aa,45b++,,,yeah .
1777.79,1778.66,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,s- - source it will be ==
1778.66,1779.62,Bed006-c2,s.%--,,,,you know we'll f- ==
1779.62,1781.03,Bed006-c2,s^df,46a,,,we know a lot about sources .
1781.03,1782.54,Bed006-c2,s,46a+,,,so we'll put all of that in source .
1781.4,1781.95,Bed006-cA,s^bk,46b,,,o_k .
1782.89,1788.35,Bed006-c2,s,,,,but it's independent whether we are using the s_p_g schema in an enter view or approach mode .
1788.01,1788.4,Bed006-cA,b^rt,,,,mm-hmm .
1788.35,1788.54,Bed006-c2,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
1788.54,1791.64,Bed006-c2,s,,,,this is just properties of the s_p_g schema .
1792.28,1797.52,Bed006-c2,s^cs,1a,,,we can talk about paths being the fastest the quickest the nicest and so forth .
1797.95,1801.11,Bed006-c2,s^cs^e,1a+,,,uh - or - or - and the trajector should be coming in there as well .
