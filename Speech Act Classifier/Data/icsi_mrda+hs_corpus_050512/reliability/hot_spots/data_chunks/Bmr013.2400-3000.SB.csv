2401.51,2401.73,Bmr013-c2,%-,,,,and ==
2401.96,2405.15,Bmr013-cB,s,1a,,,so we're i dunno - a coup- - a week or two away i would say from .
2406.14,2410.63,Bmr013-cB,s^e,1a+,,,uh - if - if that process is automatic once we get your post-process transcript .
2412.08,2412.2,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2412.31,2415.13,Bmr013-c2,s^ba,1b,,,and that doesn't - the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either .
2415.13,2418.75,Bmr013-c2,s,2a,,,i'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way will be sufficient .
2418.75,2422.73,Bmr013-c2,s^df,2a+,,,cuz i would save a lot of uh - time dividing things .
2423.56,2424.93,Bmr013-cB,s^aa|s^ba,2b,,,yeah | some of them are quite long .
2425.8,2426.17,Bmr013-cB,%-,,,,just from ==
2426.27,2426.65,Bmr013-cB,s^no,,,,i dunno .
2426.65,2427.27,Bmr013-cB,qw.%-,3a,,,how long were ?==
2427.34,2428,Bmr013-cB,qy^bu^d.%-,3a+,,,you did one ?==
2428.17,2430.96,Bmr013-c5,s,3b.4a,,,i saw a couple around twenty seconds .
2431.22,2433.72,Bmr013-c5,s,,,,and that was just without looking too hard for it .
2433.72,2436.48,Bmr013-c5,s,5a,,,so i would imagine that there might be some that are longer .
2433.83,2434.14,Bmr013-cB,s^bk,4b,,,right .
2434.43,2434.96,Bmr013-c2,fg|%-,,,,well | n- ==
2436.65,2437.17,Bmr013-c2,s,5b.6a,,,one question .
2437.17,2440.26,Bmr013-c2,qr,5b+.6a+,,,e- - w- - would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ?
2439.05,2441.68,Bmr013-c5,s^ar|s^df.%--,6b,,,no no | but if we're gonna segment it ==
2441.68,2448.09,Bmr013-c5,s,6b+,10=l=a.a,,like if there's one speaker in there that says o_k or something right in the middle it's gonna have a lot of dead time around it .
2447,2456.1,Bmr013-cB,fg|s,,**b.e,,right | it's not the - it's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment it's the fact that there's twenty seconds in which to place ** one word in the wrong place- - .
2448.09,2448.59,Bmr013-c5,s.%-,,,,so it's not ==
2456.88,2457.14,Bmr013-c5,b,,,,yeah .
2457.02,2459.66,Bmr013-cB,s^e,,,,you know if - if someone has a very short utterance there .
2457.22,2457.48,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2459.66,2465.76,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,and that's where we might wanna have this individual you know - ha- - have your pre- - pre-process input .
2463.5,2463.74,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,yep .
2465.21,2465.38,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2465.55,2465.81,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,sure .
2466.14,2466.8,Bmr013-cB,s^bd^no,,,,and i just don't know .
2466.18,2466.88,Bmr013-c2,s^ba,,,,that's very important .
2466.18,2475.35,Bmr013-c1,s,7a,,,i - i - i thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the - those mult- - multi-channel uh - speech-nonspeech detections if they would like to .
2466.8,2467.39,Bmr013-cB,s^cc,,,,i have to run it .
2474.47,2474.87,Bmr013-cB,s^bk,7b-1,,,right .
2474.96,2476.16,Bmr013-c2,qy^bu^d,7b-2.8a,,,in - in doing the hand-marking ?
2475.89,2476.15,Bmr013-c1,s^aa,8b.9a,,,yeah .
2476.16,2477.2,Bmr013-c2,s^aa|s^na,9b,,,yeah | that's what i was thinking too .
2476.85,2477.17,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
2477.45,2478.86,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,so that's probably what will happen .
2477.63,2477.82,Bmr013-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2478.86,2480.4,Bmr013-cB,s,,,,but we'll try it this way and see .
2479.9,2480.08,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2481.03,2483.03,Bmr013-cB,s^rt,,,,i mean it's probably good enough for force-alignment .
2483.61,2485.86,Bmr013-cB,s.%--,,,,if it's not then we're really - then we def- - definitely ==
2485.32,2485.56,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2486.25,2489.07,Bmr013-cB,s,10a,,,uh - but for free recognition i'm - it'll probably not be good enough .
2489.07,2492.79,Bmr013-cB,s,10a+,,,we'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross-talk and noises and things .
2491.79,2492.09,Bmr013-c1,b,,,,yep .
2496.48,2496.68,Bmr013-c3,s^ba^rt^tc,10b,,,good .
2497.19,2501.08,Bmr013-c3,s^t^tc,11a,,,s- - i think that's probably our agenda or starting up there .
2500.24,2501.55,Bmr013-c2,fg|s,11b.12a,,,oh | i wanted to ask one thing .
2501.59,2501.82,Bmr013-c3,qw^rt,12b.13a,,,yeah ?
2501.92,2503.3,Bmr013-c2,s^rt,13b.14a,,,the microphones - the new microphones .
2503.3,2504.05,Bmr013-c2,qw.%-,13b+.14a+,,,when do we get uh ?==
2504.36,2505.79,Bmr013-c8,h|s,14b.15a,,,uh - | they said it would take about a week .
2506.01,2506.56,Bmr013-c2,s^bk|s^ba,15b,,,oh | exciting .
2506.87,2506.99,Bmr013-c2,s^bk,,,,k_ .
2507.03,2507.16,Bmr013-c3,s^bk,,,,k_ .
2507.04,2507.77,Bmr013-c4,qy^bu^d^rt,16a,,,you ordered them already ?
2507.56,2507.81,Bmr013-c8,s^aa,16b.17a,,,mm-hmm .
2508.3,2508.64,Bmr013-c4,s^ba,17b,,,great .
2509.08,2511,Bmr013-cB,qw,18a,,,so what happens to our old microphones ?
2512.36,2514.16,Bmr013-c3,s,18b-1,,,they go where old microphones go .
2512.53,2512.97,Bmr013-c8,h,18b-2,,,um ==
2512.8,2514.03,Bmr013-cB,qy^rt,,,,do we give them to someone ?
2514.55,2514.75,Bmr013-cB,qrr.%--,,,,or ?==
2515.64,2519.31,Bmr013-c8,s.%--,18b-2+,,,well the only thing we're gonna have extra for now ==
2518.4,2519.54,Bmr013-cB,s,19a,,,we don't have more receivers .
2519.54,2519.99,Bmr013-cB,s.%-,,,,we just have ==
2520.17,2520.87,Bmr013-c8,s^aa|%--,19b,,,right | we don- ==
2520.82,2521.2,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,right .
2520.87,2523.09,Bmr013-c8,s,20a,,,so the only thing we'll have extra now is just the lapel .
2523.46,2525.09,Bmr013-c8,s,20a+,,,not - not the bodypack .
2525.45,2526.42,Bmr013-c8,s^e,20a++,,,just the lapel .
2525.9,2527.04,Bmr013-cB,s^2^m,20b,,,just the lapel itself .
2526.97,2529.4,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,um - and then one of the - one of those .
2529.79,2536.18,Bmr013-c8,s,21a,,,since what i decided to do on morgan's suggestion was just get two new microphones um - and try them out .
2536.43,2537.06,Bmr013-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2536.74,2538.27,Bmr013-c8,s,21a+,,,and then if we like them we'll get more .
2538.89,2539.16,Bmr013-cB,s^bk,21b,,,o_k .
2539.07,2539.3,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
2539.41,2541.26,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,since they're - they're like two hundred bucks a piece .
2541.26,2543.92,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,we won't uh - at least try them out .
2543.83,2545.79,Bmr013-c4,s^bu,22a,,,so it's a replacement for this headset mike .
2545.04,2546.16,Bmr013-c8,s^aa,22b,,,yep yep .
2546.13,2546.34,Bmr013-c3,b,,,,yeah .
2547.33,2548.92,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,and they're gonna do the wiring for us .
2549.18,2550.82,Bmr013-c4,qw,23a,,,what's the um - style of the headset ?
2551.07,2553.45,Bmr013-c8,s,23b,,,it's um - it's by crown .
2553.51,2556.45,Bmr013-c8,s^e,23b+,,,and it's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies .
2556.99,2562.43,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,and uh - when i s- - when i mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the sony .
2562.79,2565.16,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,and this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it .
2565.34,2565.68,Bmr013-c4,b.%,,,,hmm .
2565.62,2570.58,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,and i checked on the web and every site i went to raved about this particular mike .
2571.15,2573.28,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,it's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well .
2573.28,2574.42,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,so we'll see if it's any good .
2574.96,2577.4,Bmr013-c8,s,,,,but uh - i think it's promising .
2578.22,2580.57,Bmr013-c2,qy^bu^d^rt,24a,,,you said it was used by aerobics instructors ?
2579.95,2580.15,Bmr013-c8,s^aa,24b.25a,,,{yup} .
2579.97,2585.35,Bmr013-c8,fg|s,,,,yep yep | so it was - it was advertised for performers .
