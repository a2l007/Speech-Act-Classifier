28.031,29.831,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,a range of microphones .
28.183,28.393,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
30.241,30.821,Bmr001-c0,qw,,,,what's this one here ?
30.821,34.041,Bmr001-c0,s^bu^rt.%--,6a,,,this - this one is - has a couple of cheezy electrettes and ==
32.735,35.565,Bmr001-c8,s,6b,,,yeah that's - that's the dummy - dummy p_d_a .
35.744,36.744,Bmr001-c0,qr^bu^d^rt.%--,7a,,,that's connected too or ?==
37.335,37.425,Bmr001-c1,s^aa,7b-1.8a,,,yep .
37.719,38.279,Bmr001-c8,s^aa,7b-2.8a,,,yeah it is .
38.226,38.956,Bmr001-c0,s^bk,8b,,,that's connected .
39.281,40.151,Bmr001-c1,s^2,,,,yeah both channels .
39.286,40.576,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,it's got two - to both channels .
40.106,40.616,Bmr001-c8,s^co,8a+,,,oh hang on .
42.07,42.35,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
43.167,44.547,Bmr001-c8,s^aa,8a++,,,yeah it is at the moment .
43.876,44.366,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,o_k .
45.413,45.583,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yep .
45.973,46.423,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,o_k .
46.733,47.283,Bmr001-c0,%,,,,this is ==
46.825,48.435,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,although the gain is pretty low .
48.924,52.749,Bmr001-c1,s^tc.%-,,,,so for the um - read numbers task i have extracted these ==
51.768,52.108,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
51.801,54.695,Bmr001-c8,s^co|s^cs,9a,,,hang on | let's - let's - o_k let's just - let's just name the microphones .
55.147,55.387,Bmr001-c1,s^bk,9b,,,o_k .
55.601,60.941,Bmr001-c8,s,10a,,,so i'm speaking on the ear mounted uh - wired headset thing .
62.696,62.966,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,o_k .
63.146,65.746,Bmr001-c1,s^bk|s,10b|11a,,,right | and i'm now talking on microphone number two .
66.467,68.077,Bmr001-c1,h|s^bsc,11b.12a,,,uh - | the wireless microphone number two .
68.3,68.46,Bmr001-c8,s^bk,12b,,,yeah .
68.766,70.826,Bmr001-c0,fg|s^no,13a,,,um - | i have no idea which one i'm - i'm on .
70.932,71.132,Bmr001-c1,%-,,,,i'm ==
70.956,71.446,Bmr001-c0,s^fe,14a,,,oh one !
71.086,71.676,Bmr001-c8,s,13b,,,you're on one .
71.446,72.386,Bmr001-c0,s^r,14b.15a,20=l=a.a,,oh i'm number one .
72.439,73.069,Bmr001-c8,s^bk^j,15b,,,absolutely .
73.02,76.18,Bmr001-c0,fh|s,,b.e,,o_k | which is a - a l- - a lapel .
76.18,78.55,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,in fact it's sticking through my lapel .
78.202,78.422,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yes .
79.369,84.745,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,o_k so this is - this is the p_z_m nearest the eh - eh - the machine room end of the table .
85.115,85.435,Bmr001-c1,%-,16a,,,actually i- ==
85.207,86.137,Bmr001-c8,s.%-,,,,then there's ==
86.137,87.237,Bmr001-c8,s^bk,16b,,,i know but yeah .
87.707,90.137,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,it's number three it says but we'll be able to figure it out .
90.137,91.257,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,this is at the middle of the table .
92.087,93.307,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,this further down the table .
95.707,98.107,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and this - this one is right at the end of the table .
98.487,98.767,Bmr001-c8,qy^d^f^g,,,,o_k ?
99.267,100.367,Bmr001-c8,s.%--,,,,and then we've got the uh ==
102.271,105.611,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,this is the left side of the dummy p_d_a and this would be the right side .
106.527,109.297,Bmr001-c0,s,17a,30=l=a;g.a,,i think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody's home movies .
109.509,110.709,Bmr001-c1,s^aa,17b-1,b.c,,yes it'll be pretty horrible .
110.956,111.496,Bmr001-c0,b.%,,,,{@reject@} yeah o_k .
111.05,111.43,Bmr001-c8,s^ba,17b-2,,,very exciting .
111.78,118.03,Bmr001-c1,s^tc,,,,so what i have on these forms here is for the read numbers - read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from aurora .
118.38,119.03,Bmr001-c1,fh,,,,and uh ==
119.598,123.888,Bmr001-c1,s^cs,18a,,,so what i was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading - reading the numbers on the form .
125.116,126.676,Bmr001-c0,s^bk|qw^rt,18b.19a,,,o_k | what do we do with the stuff on top ?
127.01,127.46,Bmr001-c1,s^co,19b,,,fill it out .
128.593,128.873,Bmr001-c0,%--,,,,but i ==
129.397,130.397,Bmr001-c0,qy^rt.%--,20a,40=l=a.a,,do we say it after we ?==
130.838,131.058,Bmr001-c8,s^ar,20b-1,,,no .
131.26,132.01,Bmr001-c1,s^ar,20b-2,,,no you don't need to .
131.468,132.018,Bmr001-c8,s^co,,b.c,,just write it down .
133.263,134.313,Bmr001-c0,qw^rt,21a,,,what are we - why are we writing it down ?
134.782,142.962,Bmr001-c1,s,21b.22a,,,so that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing .
139.006,139.446,Bmr001-c0,s^bk,22b,,,oh .
143.509,144.734,Bmr001-c0,s^ba,,,,o_k that's good .
144.734,146.364,Bmr001-c0,s,23a,,,so i don't need to fill that out right now .
146.364,147.354,Bmr001-c0,s^cs,,,,so maybe we should just say it .
148.275,150.387,Bmr001-c1,qw^ng^rt,23b.24a,,,w- - why don't you want to fill it out right now ?
148.91,149.33,Bmr001-c8,fg,,,,o_k .
150.387,150.897,Bmr001-c1,s^bu.%--,,,,just so that ==
151.366,153.256,Bmr001-c0,s,24b,,,so then we're not spending the time writing it out .
153.326,154.696,Bmr001-c0,s^e,24b,,,so that we're spending the time talking .
154.783,156.013,Bmr001-c8,s^cs,,,,well - how about you give me one of those .
156.013,156.753,Bmr001-c8,s^cs,,,,and we can fill it out .
156.753,157.463,Bmr001-c8,s^cs,,,,and morgan can read .
157.463,158.993,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and then we can do it like that .
158.612,161.802,Bmr001-c0,s^df,25a,,,i'm just uh - concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things .
160.571,160.851,Bmr001-c1,s^bk,25b,,,o_k .
161.406,162.206,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah yeah yeah .
162.142,162.232,Bmr001-c0,qy^d^f^g.%,,,,right ?
164.182,169.932,Bmr001-c1,s,26a,,,and so you have to be sure to pause between each line since we're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way .
164.33,164.58,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,oh .
169.227,169.377,Bmr001-c0,s^bk,26b,,,right .
170.21,171.52,Bmr001-c0,fg|s,27a,,,o_k | so this is morgan .
171.52,172.69,Bmr001-c0,s,27a+,,,i'm going to read some numbers now .
174.235,200.363,Bmr001-c0,,,,,DIGIT_TASK
201.913,202.433,Bmr001-c0,s,27a++,,,that's my group .
203.426,224.937,Bmr001-c1,,,,,DIGIT_TASK
226.282,246.263,Bmr001-c8,,,,,DIGIT_TASK
248.022,250.032,Bmr001-c1,s,29a,,laughing after this utterance but the utterance itself is not hot,so i definitely wasn't pausing enough between them .
251.114,252.724,Bmr001-c8,s^by,29b.30a,,,this is - these are things we will find out .
251.554,252.324,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,that'll be an issue .
252.674,252.984,Bmr001-c1,s^bk,30b,,,yep .
252.954,253.254,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
253.584,255.374,Bmr001-c0,s^no,,,,i don't know if i said mine was transcript zero .
255.374,255.814,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,but it was .
255.936,256.236,Bmr001-c1,s^fe.x,,,,mm-hmm !
258.663,259.293,Bmr001-c0,fh|s^tc,,,,oh - | good .
260.166,260.496,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,o_k .
260.174,260.584,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,o_k .
261.147,261.737,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,that's a little bit .
262.79,264.523,Bmr001-c8,qy^rt,,,,can i have something to write on the back of ?
263.673,265.813,Bmr001-c0,fg|qo,,,,so - | so where are we in this ?
265.062,265.372,Bmr001-c8,s^ft,,,,thanks .
266.043,269.213,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,let's see so we now - we now have a few mikes that work .
269.623,271.003,Bmr001-c0,qw,31a,,,how long did it take you to set this up ?
271.978,272.218,Bmr001-c8,s^fe,,,,oh !
272.428,276.758,Bmr001-c8,s,31b,,,it didn't - doesn't take - well - i mean - as you see we haven't really set it up that well but it doesn't - it doesn't take long to set up .
276.758,281.03,Bmr001-c8,h|s,31b+.32a,,,i mean - | we just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that .
281.881,287.426,Bmr001-c1,s^aa|s^e,32b.33a,,,right | and that - that included a fair amount of fiddling around since it's - it's more or less the first time we've tried to do it .
281.905,282.405,Bmr001-c8,fh,,,,i mean - it's ==
284.165,285.645,Bmr001-c8,fg|s.%-,33b,,,yeah | i mean the equipment ==
287.946,288.136,Bmr001-c8,fg,,,,right .
288.504,291.274,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,the equip- - me and adam went through it yesterday just looked at everything .
291.274,293.964,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,but it's all kind of here and set up so it's just a question of turning it all on .
294.906,297.695,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and um - running the program .
296.492,305.068,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,i mean ev- - eventually we'll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't - aren't - people aren't tripping over the wires and so on .
302.662,302.922,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,right .
305.476,307.836,Bmr001-c0,qr^rt,34a,,,are we gonna - i mean - is it gonna be over there or is it gonna be in there ?
308.402,314.552,Bmr001-c8,h|s,34b,,,um - | it's - it's gonna b- - it's - for reasons - because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there .
314.552,315.382,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,there's more equipment in there .
316.373,319.513,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,but there's - the idea is that there are these microphones on the table .
319.513,322.833,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat .
323.264,327.124,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and then that's - they - a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there .
327.8,334.37,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors so that - so that it's not open to fiddling .
335.901,336.671,Bmr001-c0,s^bu,35a,,,so that's what's gonna happen .
336.903,337.183,Bmr001-c1,s^aa,35b,,,right .
338.766,338.996,Bmr001-c8,%-,,,,that's ==
339.052,342.622,Bmr001-c1,qr^rt,36a,,,do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ?
343.276,343.846,Bmr001-c8,s,36b,,,we need to do that .
343.926,345.566,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,it's on a list of things to do .
345.946,349.266,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i keep on hoping that they're gonna get done but they don't .
349.898,354.118,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,well - i - i can help them get done um - one question is budget .
349.933,350.263,Bmr001-c8,%-,,,,i ==
353.105,353.365,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
354.118,359.598,Bmr001-c1,qy,37a,,,do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that ?
359.801,360.461,Bmr001-c0,h|s^no,37b,,,oh - i mean - | i don't know .
360.461,363.341,Bmr001-c0,qy^rt,38a,,,did we s- - did we spend our - the budget already that we had ?
363.453,363.793,Bmr001-c8,s^aa,38b,,,yeah .
366.316,368.656,Bmr001-c0,h|qw^rt,39a,,,uh | how much are we talking about here ?
371.221,374.144,Bmr001-c8,h|s^no,39b,,,um - | i don't know .
374.144,377.964,Bmr001-c8,s,40a,,,a cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars two hundred dollars something like that .
378.115,381.725,Bmr001-c0,s^na,40b,,,yeah i mean - you know - we - we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without - without worrying about it .
378.144,378.414,Bmr001-c8,fh,,,,i mean ==
381.078,381.278,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
382.318,390.327,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,i mean - i think - um - i'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that - that uh - stuff gets broken or - or you know .
389.238,389.448,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
390.98,399.05,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,well - i think our intention at this point is when we're not using it to record a meeting we'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on .
399.523,399.853,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
400.223,400.493,Bmr001-c1,fh,,,,so ==
400.868,406.618,Bmr001-c8,s,41a,,,but - well - we should get to a - a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible .
406.96,418.945,Bmr001-c0,s^aa|s:s,41b.42a,,,yeah | and there's also the minor matter it'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say yes this is where we do such-and-such and then be able to see uh - you know - some kind of - i mean - it's less important than doing what we're doing right now .
413.278,413.458,Bmr001-c1,s^bk,42b,,,right .
413.458,414.018,Bmr001-c1,%-,,,,not have it ==
415.072,415.262,Bmr001-c8,b,43a,,,yeah .
418.945,419.175,Bmr001-c0,fh,,,,but ==
419.568,419.728,Bmr001-c8,b,43b,,,yeah .
422.196,422.786,Bmr001-c0,fh,,,,so ==
423.273,432.079,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i mean - there's one big issue with the equipment still which is um - ultimately we're gonna - well - the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets .
432.179,434.437,Bmr001-c8,s^rt,,,,but there's this amplification problem .
434.916,437.456,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i built this thing it's - that's - it's very noisy .
437.456,442.456,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,we're actually recording - i'm - i'm going through it at the moment but it's so noisy that i am not using for this .
442.616,445.146,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,it's - it's designed to be used for the - for the desktop meeting as well .
445.746,450.196,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,but i'm using - running that through my uh - damp machine as a pre-amp as an alternative .
450.943,454.283,Bmr001-c0,s^cs,,,,well - we should be able to just go buy some preamps i would think .
455.043,455.403,Bmr001-c8,s^am,,,,yeah .
455.859,456.989,Bmr001-c8,s.%--,,,,it's just - it eh ==
457.908,459.068,Bmr001-c8,s^nd,,,,you see how clumsy this is .
459.068,459.218,Bmr001-c8,qy^d^g^rt,,,,right ?
459.218,460.998,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i have to use these batteries to bias them .
460.998,465.148,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,and i'm only get two channels and there're a bunch of - there are like three connectors in the circuit .
465.578,476.646,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,the thing is like - it's - it's not s- - it's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one - in one swoop .
477.68,479.4,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,so it seemed like it was a good idea to make one .
480.19,482.693,Bmr001-c8,fh|s,,,,um - | and i'm still not sure .
482.693,484.483,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i mean - i think i probably know how to fix this .
482.973,483.343,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
484.483,489.617,Bmr001-c8,s,45a,,,i can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise but it's kind of a buy .
488.916,490.806,Bmr001-c1,s,45b,,,well - ultimately we're gonna need to build one anyway .
491.432,491.622,Bmr001-c0,qy,46a,,,are we ?
491.988,492.248,Bmr001-c1,s^aa,46b-1,,,sure .
492.074,492.534,Bmr001-c8,s^nd.%-,46b-2,,,well - we could just ==
492.248,493.938,Bmr001-c1,s^df^rt,,,,because we- - we're gonna have to put it in a p_d_a .
495.936,496.276,Bmr001-c0,s^am.%--,,,,well ==
497.553,497.733,Bmr001-c1,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,,right ?
497.733,502.185,Bmr001-c1,s^rt,47a,,,if we have microphones in a p_d_a it's gonna need bias and a pre-amp .
502.566,505.526,Bmr001-c0,s,47b,,,i guess i'd sort of figured that - that jim would do that at some point .
505.48,505.82,Bmr001-c1,b,,,,mm-hmm .
505.826,506.016,Bmr001-c0,qy^d^f^g^rt,48a,,,right ?
506.082,506.332,Bmr001-c8,s^aa,48b.49a.50a,,,yeah .
507.434,507.694,Bmr001-c8,s^ar^bsc.%--,50b,,,well n- ==
508.143,508.403,Bmr001-c8,s^aa^r,49b,,,yeah .
511.725,512.465,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,jim is busy at the moment .
512.465,512.915,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,that's the problem .
512.915,514.405,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,i was kind of hoping that jim was going to build this box .
515.153,516.803,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,but um - but he hasn't had time .
515.173,515.473,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
517.379,519.179,Bmr001-c8,s,,,,well i think - i think he is quite interested in doing it .
519.289,519.389,Bmr001-c8,fh,,,,but ==
520.025,520.355,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,o_k .
520.878,529.748,Bmr001-c0,h|s^cs^tc,,,,well - | if it's too noisy and if there's something we can buy again for you know - moderate amount of price even if it takes a couple boxes or something maybe we should just do it .
527.12,527.33,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
528.441,528.671,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,yeah .
530.468,534.458,Bmr001-c0,s^cs.%--,,,,and then - and then later we can uh - replace it with ==
535.534,538.204,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,because there may be other considerations that will go into the design .
538.204,546.995,Bmr001-c0,s,,,,i mean - uh - our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are - i don't know - might change this design so .
542.8,543.18,Bmr001-c1,b,,,,mm-hmm .
545.919,546.139,Bmr001-c1,b,,,,right .
548.973,570.808,Bmr001-c0,s,51a,,,there was uh - a statement made uh - which i don't think is right by the way but - there was a statement made at the uh - darpa communicator meeting i was at recently that um - microphone - multiple microphones at a distance of less than three feet or something like that were totally useless .
571.248,572.088,Bmr001-c0,s^e,,,,completely irrelevant .
572.928,573.158,Bmr001-c8,s^bk^fe,51b,,,oh !
573.434,573.654,Bmr001-c0,b,,,,yeah .
573.578,575.218,Bmr001-c1,qr^bu^rt.%--,52a,,,you - you mean for noise cancelling or ?==
574.937,576.137,Bmr001-c0,s^aa^m,52b,,,for nois- - noise cancelling .
576.927,581.207,Bmr001-c0,fh|s,,50=l=a;c.a,,um - | my counter argument is - is an - uh - uh - um - a white rat .
583.28,588.08,Bmr001-c0,s,,b.e,,uh - which has th- - it's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well .
585.075,585.315,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,oh .
588.789,590.951,Bmr001-c0,fh,,,,um - but - yeah .
589.921,590.261,Bmr001-c8,b,,,,o_k .
591.123,591.623,Bmr001-c8,s^bd,,,,this happened .
591.829,593.949,Bmr001-c1,qy^bu^rt,53a,,,do they mean omnidirectional ?
593.949,594.719,Bmr001-c1,qy^rt,53a+,,,is that their point ?
594.719,600.269,Bmr001-c1,s,,,,i mean - all the noise cancelling mikes they're - you know they're a few m- - millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions .
