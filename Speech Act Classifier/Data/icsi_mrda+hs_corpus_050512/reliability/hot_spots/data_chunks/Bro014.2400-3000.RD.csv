2406.76,2417.23,Bro014-c0,s,55b++++++++.58a,,,and so if we - if we like remove the mel filter bank from the f_f_t we have something that's close to the excitation signal .
2417.83,2418.22,Bro014-c4,x,,,,oh .
2418.76,2419.35,Bro014-c2,s^bk,58b,,,o_k .
2419.12,2423.98,Bro014-c0,s^e^rt,55b+++++++++.59a,,,it's something that's like a - a- - a train of p- - a pulse train for voiced sound .

2441.59,2442.03,Bro014-c0,s.%-,6b+,,,this is ==
2441.65,2445.71,Bro014-c5,s,5b++,,,but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation .
2443.61,2444.12,Bro014-c0,b,,,,right .
2444.71,2445.13,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2445.83,2446.63,Bro014-c5,s,5b+++,,,for the difference .
2446.63,2447.96,Bro014-c5,s,5b++++.7a,,,and this is the difference .
2448.33,2449.14,Bro014-c2,s^bk,7b,,,this is the difference .
2448.53,2448.76,Bro014-c0,b,,,,yeah .
2449.14,2449.51,Bro014-c2,s^bk,7b+,,,o_k .
2450.06,2451.32,Bro014-c0,s,8a,,,so of course it's around zero .
2450.08,2450.31,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2450.38,2450.77,Bro014-c4,s^t3.%--,,,,sure looks ==

2453.21,2453.5,Bro014-c0,s.%--,,,,it is ==
2453.34,2458.13,Bro014-c5,s^df,8b+,,,because we begin uh in fifteen point - the fifteen point .
2456.79,2457.13,Bro014-c2,fg,,r,,so ==

2463.85,2464.04,Bro014-c0,s^aa,10b-1,,,yeah .
2463.88,2464.36,Bro014-c2,s^m^na,10b-2,,,the pitch .
2464.04,2464.7,Bro014-c0,s^na,10b-1+,,,it's the pitch .
2464.63,2465.1,Bro014-c2,s^bk,10b-2+,,,o_k .
2464.77,2464.97,Bro014-c1,s^bk,9b+,,,yeah .
2464.81,2464.89,Bro014-c0,b,,,,yeah .
2465.18,2465.27,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2465.18,2466.29,Bro014-c1,s,9b++.11a,,,that's like fundamental frequency .
2466.23,2466.49,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2466.65,2467.56,Bro014-c2,s^bk,11b,,,o_k .
2466.73,2468.03,Bro014-c1,fg|%--,,r,,so i mean | i- - t- - t- ==
2467.56,2468.19,Bro014-c2,s^bk,11b+,,,i see .
2468.23,2471.03,Bro014-c1,s.%--,,,,i mean to first order what you'd - what you're doing ==
2471.24,2474.55,Bro014-c1,s^co,,,,i mean ignore all the details and all the ways which is - that these are complete lies .
2474.98,2475.38,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2475.17,2485.36,Bro014-c1,fh|s,,,,uh | the - the - you know what you're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have uh in your head a - a - a - a simplified production model for speech .
2485.1,2485.25,Bro014-c5,b,,,,yeah .
2485.36,2485.74,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2485.71,2490.68,Bro014-c1,s^e,,,,in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that's driving some filters .
2486.04,2489.68,Bro014-c5,s^t3,,,,this is the - the auto-correlation - the r_zero energy .
2488.95,2489.59,Bro014-c0,qy^t3.%--,,,,do you have the mean ?==
2490.01,2493.28,Bro014-c0,qy^r^t3,12a,,,do you have the mean for the auto-correlation ?
2491.12,2494.43,Bro014-c1,s,,,,uh first order for speech recognition you say i don't care about the source .
2491.9,2492.25,Bro014-c5,s^2^t3.%--,12b,,,for ==
2493.37,2493.74,Bro014-c5,s^aa^t3,12b+,,,yeah .
2493.74,2494.43,Bro014-c5,s^na^t3,12b++.13a,,,i have the mean .
2494.19,2495.74,Bro014-c0,s^nd^t3,13b.14a,,,well i mean for the - the energy .
2494.24,2494.72,Bro014-c2,b,,,,right .
2494.43,2494.77,Bro014-c1,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,,right ?
2494.94,2495.52,Bro014-c2,b,,,,right .
2495.24,2496.76,Bro014-c1,s,,,,and so you just want to find out what the filters are .
2496.21,2496.45,Bro014-c5,s^aa^t3,14b,,,yeah .
2496.76,2507.33,Bro014-c1,s,,,,the filters roughly act like a um - a uh - a- - an overall resonant - you know f- - some resonances and so forth that th- - that's processing excitation .
2496.82,2497.06,Bro014-c5,s^na^t3,14b+,,,here .
2498.47,2499.55,Bro014-c0,s^t3,15a,,,they should be more close .
2500.01,2500.31,Bro014-c5,s^ar^t3,15b,,,ah no .
2500.31,2500.98,Bro014-c5,s^rt^t3,15b+,,,this is this .
2501.63,2503.05,Bro014-c5,s^rt^t3,15b++,,,more close is this .
2503.28,2503.58,Bro014-c5,s^t3,15b+++.16a,,,and this .
2504.59,2505.13,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2505.12,2505.39,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2505.61,2505.81,Bro014-c0,s^bk^t3,16b,,,yeah .
2505.81,2506.43,Bro014-c0,s^t3.%--,,,,so they are ==
2506.43,2507.73,Bro014-c0,s^t3,,,,this is - there is less difference .
2506.56,2506.99,Bro014-c5,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2507.76,2513.06,Bro014-c1,s,,,,so if you look at the spectral envelope just the very smooth properties of it you get something closer to that .
2508.41,2509.91,Bro014-c0,s^t3,17a,,,this is less - it's less robust .
2510.24,2510.86,Bro014-c5,s^m^na^t3,17b,,,less robust .
2510.93,2511.19,Bro014-c5,s^aa^t3,17b+,,,yeah .
2513.41,2513.84,Bro014-c0,b,,,,oh yeah .
2513.56,2519.87,Bro014-c1,s,18a,,,and the notion is if you have the full spectrum with all the little nitty-gritty details that that has the effect of both .
2516.88,2517.22,Bro014-c2,s^bk,18b,,,yeah .
2519.8,2520.27,Bro014-c2,b,18b+,,,mm-hmm .
2519.87,2523.64,Bro014-c1,s,,,,and it would be a multiplication in - in frequency domain .
2523.64,2527.89,Bro014-c1,s^e,,,,so that would be like an addition in log power spectrum domain .
2526.68,2527,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2527.39,2527.67,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2528.49,2536.24,Bro014-c1,s,,,,and so this is saying well if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope and you subtract that off what you get is the excitation .
2536.55,2538.74,Bro014-c1,s,,,,and i call that lies because you don't really have that .
2538.74,2543.18,Bro014-c1,s^df,,,,you just have some kind of signal-processing trickery to get something that's kind of smooth .
2543.61,2545.39,Bro014-c1,s^df,19a,,,it's not really what's happening in the vocal tract .
2544.88,2545.26,Bro014-c2,s^aa,19b,,,yeah .
2545.39,2547.49,Bro014-c1,s^df,,,,so you're not really getting the vocal excitation .
2545.46,2545.9,Bro014-c2,s^aa,19b+,,,right .
2547.96,2554.48,Bro014-c1,s^df,,,,that's why i was going to the - why i was referring to it in a more a more uh uh conservative way .
2554.48,2555.54,Bro014-c1,s.%--,,,,when i was saying well it's ==
2555.54,2555.68,Bro014-c1,fh,,,,yeah .
2555.88,2556.48,Bro014-c1,s,,,,it's the excitation .
2556.48,2557.64,Bro014-c1,s,,,,but it's not really the excitation .
2557.64,2559.61,Bro014-c1,s.%--,20a,,,it's whatever it is that's different between ==
2559.52,2559.86,Bro014-c2,s^bk,20b,,,oh .
2560.25,2561.17,Bro014-c2,s.%--,20b+,,,this moved in the ==
2560.25,2564.13,Bro014-c1,s,,,,so - so stand- - standing back from that you sort of say there's this very detailed representation .
2561.17,2561.55,Bro014-c2,s^bk,20b++,,,yeah .
2564.26,2564.77,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2564.52,2566.11,Bro014-c1,s,,,,you go to a smooth representation .
2566.51,2569.53,Bro014-c1,s^df^r,,,,you go to a smooth representation cuz this typically generalizes better .
2569.57,2570.15,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2570.16,2570.58,Bro014-c1,fh,,,,um ==
2570.87,2572.75,Bro014-c1,s,,,,but whenever you smooth you lose something .
2573.14,2575.59,Bro014-c1,s,21a,,,so the question is have you lost something you can you use .
2575.51,2575.92,Bro014-c2,s^aa,21b,,,right .
2576.19,2581.36,Bro014-c1,fh|s^cs,,,,um | probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta- - saying o_k our feature set will be the f_f_t .
2581.8,2585.4,Bro014-c1,s^df,,,,cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother .
2585.6,2585.94,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2585.78,2587.25,Bro014-c1,s,,,,but maybe there's something that we missed .
2587.36,2587.69,Bro014-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2587.63,2588.37,Bro014-c1,qw,,,,so what is it ?
2588.37,2590.21,Bro014-c1,s.%--,,,,and then you go back to the intuition that ==
2590.21,2591.76,Bro014-c1,s,,,,well you don't really get the excitation .
2591.76,2593.08,Bro014-c1,s,,,,but you get something related to it .
2592.89,2593.27,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2593.5,2593.8,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2593.8,2599.44,Bro014-c1,s,22a,,,and it - and as you can see from those pictures you do get something that shows some periodicity uh in frequency .
2599.64,2599.94,Bro014-c2,qh^bh^rt,,,,hmm ?
2599.76,2600.12,Bro014-c1,fh,,,,you know .
2600.12,2601.26,Bro014-c1,s,,,,and - and - and also in time .
2601.26,2601.5,Bro014-c1,fh,,,,so ==
2601.46,2602.41,Bro014-c2,s^ba,22b,,,that's - that's really neat .
2602.25,2602.67,Bro014-c1,fg,,,,so ==
2603.57,2605.48,Bro014-c2,qy^bu^d^rt,23a,,,so you don't have one for unvoiced picture ?
2606.02,2606.82,Bro014-c5,s^nd,23b.24a,,,uh not here .
2607.15,2607.42,Bro014-c2,s^bk,24b,,,oh .
2607.29,2607.78,Bro014-c5,s^nd.%--,23b+,,,no i have s- ==
2607.87,2608.82,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2608.35,2608.6,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2608.6,2609.31,Bro014-c5,s^nd,23b++,,,but not here .
2610.09,2615.97,Bro014-c1,s.%--,25a,,,but presumably you'll see something that won't have this kind of uh uh uh regularity in frequency uh in the ==
2611.23,2611.38,Bro014-c0,fg,,,,but ==
2615.17,2616.3,Bro014-c0,s^bk,25b,,,yeah well .
2615.28,2615.47,Bro014-c5,s.x,,,,not here .
2616.84,2619.03,Bro014-c2,s,26a,,,i would li- - i would like to see those pictures .
2617.06,2617.6,Bro014-c5,b,,,,well so .
2618.4,2618.65,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2618.86,2620.75,Bro014-c5,s^nd,26b,,,i can't see you now .
2619.56,2619.79,Bro014-c2,fh,,,,yeah .
2620.05,2620.3,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2622.51,2622.79,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2623.57,2623.89,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2623.76,2624.13,Bro014-c5,s^nd,26b+,,,i don't have .
2625.3,2626.51,Bro014-c2,qy^bu^d.%--,,,,and so you said this is pretty ?==
2626.51,2629.32,Bro014-c2,qy^rt,27a,10=l=o.a,,doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise ?
2629.65,2630.66,Bro014-c0,s^na,27b,,,it seems .
2630.66,2630.86,Bro014-c0,s^aa,27b+,,,yeah .
2630.99,2631.12,Bro014-c5,b,,,,pfft .
2631.08,2631.33,Bro014-c2,b,,,,huh .
2631.12,2632,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,um ==
2631.68,2631.82,Bro014-c5,s,,,,oops .
2632.31,2634.41,Bro014-c5,s,,b,,the mean is different with it .
2634.72,2638.5,Bro014-c5,s^df.%--,28a,c,,because the - the histogram for the - the classifica- ==
2637.57,2637.94,Bro014-c0,s^ar,28b.29a,,,no no no .
2637.94,2639.97,Bro014-c0,s^df.%--,28b+,,,but th- - the kind of robustness to noise ==
2638.5,2638.78,Bro014-c5,s^bk^fe,29b,,,oh !
2639.97,2648.69,Bro014-c0,s.%--,30a,,,so if - if you take this frame uh from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance ==
2642.49,2642.76,Bro014-c5,b,,,,hmm .
2649.05,2650.51,Bro014-c2,qy^2,30b.31a,,,you end up with a similar difference ?
2650.25,2651.26,Bro014-c0,s^aa,31b,,,y- - y- - y- - yeah .
2651.26,2651.99,Bro014-c0,s^na^r.%--,31b+,,,we end up with ==
2651.57,2652.11,Bro014-c2,qy^d^rt,,,,over here ?

2654.16,2657.77,Bro014-c5,s^rt,33a,,,i have here the same frame for the clean speech .
2654.23,2654.49,Bro014-c2,s^ba^bk,32b+,,,cool .
2657.94,2658.74,Bro014-c2,s^bk,33b,,,oh that's clean .
2658.38,2658.95,Bro014-c5,s.%--,,,,the same cle- ==
2659.06,2659.68,Bro014-c2,s^bk,33b+,,,oh o_k- - .
2659.22,2660.64,Bro014-c5,s,34a,,,but they are a difference .
2660.82,2666.83,Bro014-c5,s^df^rt,35a,,,because here the f_f_t is only with two hundred fifty-six point .
2660.83,2661.18,Bro014-c0,s^bk,34b,,,yeah .
2661.18,2661.43,Bro014-c0,%--,,,,that's ==
2667.03,2669.62,Bro014-c5,s,36a,,,and this is with five hundred twelve .
2667.1,2667.72,Bro014-c2,s^bk,35b,,,oh .
2669.9,2670.45,Bro014-c2,s^bk,36b,,,o_k .
2670.1,2670.34,Bro014-c0,fg,,,,yeah .
2670.34,2672.15,Bro014-c0,s,,,,this is kind of inter- - interesting also .
2672.15,2691.15,Bro014-c0,s^df,,,,because if we use the standard uh frame length of - of like twenty-five milliseconds um what happens is that for low-pitched voiced because of the frame length y- - you don't really have - you don't clearly see this periodic structure .
2691.59,2691.98,Bro014-c1,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2693.68,2696.55,Bro014-c0,s^df,,,,because of the first lobe of - of each - each of the harmonics .
2696.07,2698.94,Bro014-c2,s^bu.%--,37a,,,so this one inclu- - is a longer - ah ==
2697.34,2701.17,Bro014-c0,s,37b.38a,,,so this is like - yeah fifty milliseconds or something like that .
2700.56,2701.2,Bro014-c5,s^m^na.%--,38b,,,fifty millis- ==
2701.66,2701.9,Bro014-c5,s^aa,38b+,,,yeah .
2702.18,2703.53,Bro014-c0,s,,,,yeah but it's the same frame .
2703.68,2704.74,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,and ==
2704.34,2706.33,Bro014-c2,s^bu,39a,,,oh it's that time-frequency trade-off thing .
2706.35,2706.61,Bro014-c0,s^aa,39b.40a,,,yeah .
2706.43,2706.69,Bro014-c2,qy^d^g^rt,39a+,,,right ?
2707.53,2708.31,Bro014-c2,s^bk,40b,,,i see .
2709.39,2709.64,Bro014-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2710.04,2710.33,Bro014-c0,fg,,,,so yeah .
2710.04,2710.49,Bro014-c1,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2710.06,2712.13,Bro014-c2,qy^rt,41a,,,oh oh so this i- - is this the difference here ?
2713.05,2713.38,Bro014-c5,s^ar,41b,,,no .
2713.38,2714.34,Bro014-c5,s^nd,41b+,,,this is the signal .
2713.42,2713.75,Bro014-c2,qy^d^e^rt,,,,for that ?
2714.81,2715.76,Bro014-c5,s^nd^r,41b++,,,this is the signal .
2715.56,2715.88,Bro014-c0,s,,,,i see that .
2715.88,2716.19,Bro014-c0,s^bk,,,,oh yeah .
2716.57,2717.3,Bro014-c5,s,41b+++.42a,,,the frame .
2717.6,2718.71,Bro014-c2,s,42b.43a,,,oh that's the f- - the original .
2718.36,2719.9,Bro014-c5,s^na,43b,,,this is the fra- - the original frame .
2718.69,2718.89,Bro014-c0,fg,,,,yeah .
2718.89,2721.44,Bro014-c0,s,,,,so with a short frame basically you have only two periods .
2720.47,2720.9,Bro014-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2721.44,2724.47,Bro014-c0,s,,,,and it's not - not enough to - to have this kind of neat things .
2721.47,2722.1,Bro014-c2,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2721.56,2722.07,Bro014-c5,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2722.87,2723.35,Bro014-c2,b,,,,yeah .
2724.93,2725.09,Bro014-c0,%--,,,,but ==
2725.38,2725.76,Bro014-c5,s.%--,,,,and here ==
2725.76,2726.52,Bro014-c5,s^ar,,,,no well .
2727.58,2727.73,Bro014-c0,fg,,,,yeah .
2727.73,2730.75,Bro014-c0,s^cs,44a,,,so probably we'll have to use like long f- - long frames .
2730.85,2730.94,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,mm-hmm .
2730.85,2731.22,Bro014-c2,s^bk,44b,,,mm-hmm .
2731.44,2731.78,Bro014-c4,b,,,,hmm .
2734.07,2734.22,Bro014-c2,s^bk,,,,oh .
2734.44,2735.02,Bro014-c2,s^ba,45a,,,that's interesting .
2734.69,2735.07,Bro014-c1,b,,,,mmm .
2735.69,2736.14,Bro014-c1,s^am,45b,,,yeah maybe .
2738.08,2739.01,Bro014-c1,s^bd,45b+,,,well i mean it looks better .
2739.01,2749,Bro014-c1,s^df,45b++,,,but i mean the thing is if - if uh - if you're actually asking - you know if you actually j- - uh need to do - place along an f_f_t it may be - it may be pushing things .
2749.2,2749.4,Bro014-c0,b,,,,yeah .
2749.8,2751.26,Bro014-c1,fh,,,,and - and uh ==
2752.87,2757.58,Bro014-c2,qy^rt,46a,,,would you - would you wanna do this kind of uh difference thing after you do spectral subtraction ?
2759.22,2761.32,Bro014-c0,h|s^am,46b-1,,,uh | maybe .
2760.82,2761.03,Bro014-c5,s^ar,46b-2,,,no .
2761.67,2762.58,Bro014-c5,s^am,46b-2+,,,maybe we can do that .
2765.39,2767.62,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,mmm ==
2772.23,2772.41,Bro014-c1,b,,,,hmm .
2772.79,2774.92,Bro014-c1,s.%--,,,,the spectral subtraction is being done ==
2775.72,2777.26,Bro014-c1,qw,47a.48a,,,at what level is it being done ?
2777.26,2778.91,Bro014-c1,qy^e^rt,47a+.48a+,,,at the level of f_f_t bins ?
2778.91,2781.63,Bro014-c1,qrr^e^rt,48a++,,,or at the level of uh mel spectrum or something ?
2780.64,2781.89,Bro014-c0,fh,47b,,,um ==
2784.03,2785.35,Bro014-c0,s,48b,,,i guess it depends .
2786.53,2787.35,Bro014-c1,qw,49a,20=l-=a.a,,i mean how are they doing it ?
2787.57,2788.41,Bro014-c0,s^bk^m,49b,b-,,how they're doing it .
2788.41,2788.77,Bro014-c0,s^bk,49b+,b,,yeah .
2789.48,2790.59,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,um ==
2792,2795.94,Bro014-c0,s,49b++.50a,c,,i guess ericsson is on the um filter bank .
2794.76,2796.64,Bro014-c5,s^2,50b,,,f_f_t filter bank .
2796,2796.23,Bro014-c0,qy^d^g^rt,50a+,,,no ?

2798.81,2799.59,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,so yeah .
2799.97,2800.89,Bro014-c0,s.%--,,,,probably ==
2803.49,2805.66,Bro014-c1,s,51a,,,so in that case it might not make much difference at all .
2803.79,2805.33,Bro014-c0,s^aa,51b,,,i- - i- - it - yeah .
2806.18,2808.76,Bro014-c2,s^cs,52a,,,seems like you'd wanna do it on the f_f_t bins .
2809.19,2809.45,Bro014-c1,s^am,52b,,,maybe .
2810.08,2811.3,Bro014-c1,s^na,52b+,,,i mean certainly it'd be better .
2810.11,2811.42,Bro014-c2,s^df.%--,,r,,i- - i mean if you were gonna ==
2811.42,2812.78,Bro014-c2,s^e,,,,uh for - for this purpose that is .
2813.31,2813.56,Bro014-c1,b,,,,yeah .
2813.42,2813.81,Bro014-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .

2828.71,2837.78,Bro014-c0,s^cc,54a,,,so we'll perhaps try to convince o_g_i people to use the new - the new filters .
2837.78,2838.36,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,and ==
2839.03,2839.25,Bro014-c0,fh,,,,yeah .

2905.79,2910.08,Bro014-c5,s^cs^j,62a,b,,i think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it's better that i don't speak .
2915.98,2916.72,Bro014-c1,s^bk,62b,c,,yeah well .
2916.03,2916.28,Bro014-c5,s^df.%-,,,,because ==

2920.42,2924.31,Bro014-c1,s,62b++,50=w-=a;s.a,,and we do - we want to recognize uh you too .
2923.95,2930.45,Bro014-c5,s^cs^j,63a,b,,after the - after uh the result for the t_i-digits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people .
2931.76,2932.22,Bro014-c0,%,,,,yeah but ==
2931.85,2932.13,Bro014-c2,%,,,,y- ==

2943.14,2944.52,Bro014-c1,s^j,63b++++,c,,that way there's lots of work to do .
2945.03,2945.29,Bro014-c1,s.%--,,,,so it's ==
2947.33,2947.84,Bro014-c1,fg,,,,uh ==
2948.84,2949.38,Bro014-c1,qy^d.%--,64a,,,anything to ?==
2950.78,2952.4,Bro014-c3,h|s^nd,64b,,,n- - um | not- - not- - not much is new .
2951.05,2951.44,Bro014-c1,qy^d,,,,talk about ?
2952.4,2969.89,Bro014-c3,s,,,,so when i talked about what i'm planning to do last time i said i was um going to use avendano's method of um using a transformation um to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .
2970.52,2975.03,Bro014-c3,s,,,,{and} he has a trick for doing that involving viewing the d_f_t as a matrix .
2975.63,2976.1,Bro014-c3,fh,,,,um ==
2976.91,2981.02,Bro014-c3,fh|s,,,,but uh um | i decided not to do that after all .
2981.02,2990.3,Bro014-c3,s^df,,,,because i - i realized to use it i'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow .
2990.1,2990.79,Bro014-c1,b,,,,mm-hmm .
2990.3,2997.16,Bro014-c3,s^df,,,,and right now i think our feature computation is set to up to um take um audio as input in general .
2997.61,3002.24,Bro014-c3,s^cc,,,,so i decided that i - i'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows .
