3010.61,3011.23,Bmr007-c8,qw^bu,1b.2a,,,what was that called ?
3011.48,3012.38,Bmr007-c8,s^br,1b+.2a+,,,the uh say again .
3011.89,3018.8,Bmr007-c3,s,2b,,,i - well i- - i'm probably saying this wrong but what i said was exploratory analysis of long-distance inferences for topic coherence .
3019.54,3020.23,Bmr007-c3,s,2b+,,,something like that .
3021.6,3028.57,Bmr007-c3,fh|s,,,,um so uh | i - a lot of that was from you know what - what - what you two were doing .
3028.57,3029.49,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,so i - i sent it to you .
3029.49,3033.52,Bmr007-c3,s^cs,,,,and you know please mail me you know the corrections or suggestions for changing .
3032.15,3032.49,Bmr007-cB,b,,,,mm-hmm .
3033.52,3037.74,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,i - i don't want to make this twice it's length but - but you know just im- - improve it .
3038.01,3039.54,Bmr007-c3,fh|s.%-,,,,um | is there anything anybody ==
3038.78,3041.66,Bmr007-cB,s,3a,,,i - i did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits .
3042.61,3043.59,Bmr007-c3,s^bk^m.%-,3b,,,bunch of stuff for s- ==
3043.59,3046.5,Bmr007-c3,s^co,4a.3b+,,,o_k maybe - maybe send me a sentence that's a little thought through about that .
3044.32,3047.21,Bmr007-cB,qy^bu^cc^d^rt,4b.5a,,,so o_k i'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say a bunch of ?
3047.19,3049.53,Bmr007-c3,s^nd,5b.6a,,,bunch of stuff yeah stuff is probably bad too .
3048.13,3048.4,Bmr007-cB,b,,,,yep .
3049.05,3050.73,Bmr007-cB,s^na,6b.7a,,,stuff is not very technical .
3050.77,3051.35,Bmr007-c3,s^aa,7b,,,yeah well .
3051.15,3053.28,Bmr007-cB,s^cc,6b+.8a,,,i'll try to phrase it in passive voice .
3052.03,3052.26,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3052.97,3053.68,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah yeah .
3053.55,3054.27,Bmr007-c0,s,6b++.8a+,,,technical stuff .
3054.33,3055.54,Bmr007-c3,s^cs,,,,range of things yeah .
3057.28,3066.07,Bmr007-c3,fh|s,,,,um | and - and you know i sort of threw in what you did with what jane did on - in - under the uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps .
3066.34,3073.98,Bmr007-c3,fh|qy^co^rt^t^tc,9a,,laughing by others,uh uh | thilo can you tell us about all the work you've done on this project in the last uh last three months ?
3066.68,3066.86,Bmr007-c4,b,,,,yeah .
3069.78,3072.38,Bmr007-c2,qy.%-,,,,so - what is - what - um ?==
3073.98,3074.25,Bmr007-c3,%-,,,,that's ==
3074.03,3074.54,Bmr007-c2,s^ar,9b.10a,,,not really .
3075.96,3076.72,Bmr007-c0,s,10b,,,it's too complicated .
3076.02,3077.22,Bmr007-c2,fh|s^no,9b+,,,um | i didn't get it .
3077.22,3079.11,Bmr007-c2,qw,9b++.11a,,,wh- - what is audio pixelization ?
3079.4,3080.93,Bmr007-c3,h|s,11b,,,uh | audio pix- - wh- - he did it .
3080.93,3082.12,Bmr007-c3,qw^co,12a,,,so why don't you explain it quickly ?
3081.94,3085.62,Bmr007-cB,s,12b.13a,10=l=a.a,,it's just uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting .
3085.62,3091.43,Bmr007-cB,s,12b+.13a+,**b.c,FBH,so you know you can say things like well this should probably not be on the record ** but beep .
3090.7,3091.82,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,o_k o_k .
3092.53,3092.93,Bmr007-c2,s^bk,13b,,,i got that .
3093.23,3093.44,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3093.44,3105.1,Bmr007-c3,s,,20=l=a.a.b.e,,we - we - we spent a - a - a fair amount of time early on just talk- - dealing with this issue about op w- - e- - e- - we realized well people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later and how do you get around that .
3095.63,3095.89,Bmr007-c2,%,,,,{@reject@} .
3103.91,3104.12,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,o_k .
3105.1,3110.69,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,so in the consent form it says well you - we will look at the transcripts later and if there's something that you're unhappy with yeah .
3108.83,3109.7,Bmr007-c2,s.%--,,,,o_k and you can say ==
3110.86,3111.03,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,o_k .
3111.4,3113.26,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,but you don't want to just totally excise it .
3113.26,3114.37,Bmr007-c3,%--,,,,because ==
3114.74,3115.3,Bmr007-c3,fh,,,,um ==
3116.54,3119.26,Bmr007-c3,s,14a,,,uh well you have to be careful about excising it how - how you excise it .
3119.26,3120.82,Bmr007-c3,s^e,14a+,,,keeping the timing right and so forth .
3120.82,3125.9,Bmr007-c3,s^e,14a++,,,so that at the moment tho- - th- - the idea we're running with is - is h- - putting the beep over it .
3126.07,3128.07,Bmr007-cB,s,14b,,,yeah you can either beep or it can be silence .
3126.33,3126.69,Bmr007-c2,fh,,,,o_k .
3128.19,3130.97,Bmr007-cB,s^no,14b+,,,i - i couldn't decide which was the right way to do it .
3128.99,3129.51,Bmr007-c4,b,,,,ah yeah .
3130.97,3132.47,Bmr007-cB,s,15a,,,beep is good auditorily .
3132.77,3135.82,Bmr007-cB,s,15a+,,,if someone is listening to it there's no mistake that it's been beeped out .
3133.19,3133.36,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,yeah .
3135.62,3135.86,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,yeah .
3136.28,3138.86,Bmr007-cB,s^cs,15a++,,,but for software it's probably better for it to be silence .
3139,3139.2,Bmr007-c0,s^ar,15b,,,no no .
3139.2,3143.75,Bmr007-c0,s^nd,15b+.16a,,,you can - you know you could make a m- - as long as you keep using the same beep people could make a model of that beep .
3139.61,3139.98,Bmr007-c8,b,,,,hmm .
3143.76,3144.02,Bmr007-cB,s^bk,16b-1,,,yep .
3143.85,3144.04,Bmr007-c0,fh,,,,and ==
3144.16,3145.03,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,16b-2,,,i like that idea .
3144.51,3148.38,Bmr007-cB,s,16b-1+,,,and i use - it's - it's uh it's an a_ below middle c_ beep .
3145.06,3146.79,Bmr007-c1,s^ba,16b-3,,,i think the beep is a really good idea .
3146.23,3146.87,Bmr007-c8,s,16b-2+,,,it's very clear .
3146.46,3146.75,Bmr007-c0,b,,,,yeah .
3146.87,3148.23,Bmr007-c8,s,16b-2++.17a,,,then you don't think it's a long pause .
3147.4,3147.84,Bmr007-c1,%-,,,,also ==
3148.38,3148.85,Bmr007-cB,fh,,,,so ==
3148.82,3152.83,Bmr007-c0,s^na,17b,,,yeah it's more obvious that there was something there than if there's just silence .
3152.53,3152.75,Bmr007-c8,b,,,,yeah .
3152.53,3154.75,Bmr007-c3,fg|s^bu,18a,,,yeah | that - i mean he's - he's removing the old thing .
3152.72,3153.02,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,yeah .
3154.23,3154.45,Bmr007-c4,b,,,,yeah .
3154.57,3154.81,Bmr007-cB,b,,,,yep .
3154.75,3155.71,Bmr007-c3,fh,,,,and - and - and ==
3155.29,3155.64,Bmr007-c0,s^aa,18b,,,yea- - right .
3155.87,3156.05,Bmr007-c0,s^aa,18b+,,,right .
3155.99,3156.48,Bmr007-cB,s.%-,,,,yeah it's not ==
3156.34,3160.15,Bmr007-c0,s.%--,18b++.19a,r-**,,but i mean if you just replaced it with silence ** it's not clear whether that's really silence or ==
3158.03,3158.2,Bmr007-c2,b,,,,yeah .
3159.47,3159.74,Bmr007-c4,b,,,,yeah .
3159.56,3160.11,Bmr007-c8,s^aa,19b,,,yeah i agree .
3159.85,3160.14,Bmr007-cB,b,,,,yep .
3160.12,3160.35,Bmr007-c4,b,,,,yeah .
3160.5,3160.96,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3160.56,3161.29,Bmr007-c8,s,,,,one - one question .
3161.29,3162.65,Bmr007-c8,qy^rt,20a,,,do you do it on all channels ?
3162.72,3163.19,Bmr007-cB,s^aa,20b.21a,,,of course .
3163.31,3163.77,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,21b,,,interesting .
3163.82,3164.27,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,21b+,,,i like that .
3164.68,3167.68,Bmr007-cB,s,20b+,,,yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's uh audible .
3164.71,3164.9,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3164.72,3165.34,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,21b++,,,yeah i like that .
3165.38,3165.93,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,21b+++,,,very clear .
3167.88,3168.36,Bmr007-c8,s^ba^r,21b++++,,,very clear .
3168.4,3171.32,Bmr007-cB,s,20b++,,,uh it's - it's potentially audible you could potentially recover it .
3171.66,3172.63,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,ke- - keep a back door .
3172.66,3174.8,Bmr007-c8,s.%-,,,,well the other thing that - you know i mean the - the alternative might be to s- ==
3172.8,3173.13,Bmr007-cB,b,,,,yeah .
3174.51,3176.86,Bmr007-cB,s,,,,well i - i haven't thrown away any of the meetings that i beeped .
3176.86,3180.83,Bmr007-cB,s,,30=l=a.a,,actually yours is the only one that i beeped and then uh the ar- - darpa meeting .
3179.96,3181.3,Bmr007-c1,s,22a,b.e,,notice how quiet i am .
3182.12,3182.58,Bmr007-cB,s^fa,22b,,,sorry .
3182.88,3185.25,Bmr007-cB,s,,,,and then the darpa meeting i just excised completely .
3185.57,3185.83,Bmr007-c8,b,,,,yeah .
3185.68,3186.87,Bmr007-cB,s,,,,so it's in a private directory .
3186.19,3186.66,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,,,,that's great .
3186.2,3189.27,Bmr007-c1,s^j,23a,40=l=a;c.a.b.e,,you have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings .
3189.49,3189.64,Bmr007-c8,b,,,,yeah .
3190.3,3190.58,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,o_k .
3191.3,3192.12,Bmr007-c0,s^j,23b,,,they're easy to find then .
3192.67,3196.1,Bmr007-c3,s^co^rt^t^tc,24a,,,alright so uh i think we should uh uh go on to the digits .
3196.74,3196.94,Bmr007-cB,s^bk,24b,,,o_k .
3196.95,3201.16,Bmr007-c8,s^ba^tc,25a,,,i have one concept a- - t- - i - i want to say which is that i think it's nice that you're preserving the time relations .
3201.3,3204.47,Bmr007-c8,s^e,25a+,,,s- - so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing scissor snips .
3204.14,3204.42,Bmr007-cB,s^bk,25b,,,right .
3204.47,3208.34,Bmr007-c8,s,,,,you're - you're keeping the uh the time duration of a - de- - deleted - deleted part .
3207.23,3208,Bmr007-c1,b,,,,yeah definitely .
3207.57,3207.75,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3208.34,3209.1,Bmr007-c8,s^bk|s^t^tc,,,,o_k good | digits .
3209.02,3212.28,Bmr007-cB,s^tc,,,,yeah since we wanna possibly synchronize these things as well .
3212.76,3213.61,Bmr007-cB,s,,,,oh i should have done that .
3213.72,3214.08,Bmr007-cB,s^fe,,,,shoot !
3213.96,3214.31,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,,,,it's great .
3214.54,3214.84,Bmr007-cB,s,,,,oh well .
3214.68,3214.91,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3214.91,3215.37,Bmr007-c3,%-,,,,oh- ==
3215.04,3221.69,Bmr007-c1,qy^d,26a,,,so i guess if there's an overlap like if i'm saying something that's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped too ?
3220.64,3221.22,Bmr007-cB,s,26b,,,you'll lose it .
3221.44,3222.33,Bmr007-cB,s,26b+,,,there's no way around that .
3222.71,3222.9,Bmr007-c3,b,,,,yeah .
3223.42,3231.87,Bmr007-c3,fh|s^co^t^tc,27a,,,um | i d- - i did - before we do the digits i did also wanna remind people uh please do send me you know uh thoughts for an agenda .
3230.82,3231.1,Bmr007-cB,qy^2^d^rt,27b.28a,,,agenda ?
3231.87,3232.08,Bmr007-c3,s^aa,28b,,,yeah .
3232.08,3233.38,Bmr007-c3,s,,,,that - that would be that'd be good .
3232.8,3232.95,Bmr007-c8,s^ba,,,,good .
3233.59,3235.82,Bmr007-c3,s.%-,,,,eh so that uh people's ideas don't get ==
3234.85,3236.51,Bmr007-cB,s,29a,,,thursday crept up on me this week .
3236.67,3238.56,Bmr007-c3,s^na,29b,,,yeah well it does creep up .
3238.56,3238.93,Bmr007-c3,qy^d^g,29b+,,,doesn't it ?
3239.06,3239.37,Bmr007-c3,fh,,,,o_k .
3239.46,3242.44,Bmr007-c1,s,30a,,,and i wanted to say i think this is really interesting analysis .
3241.41,3242.77,Bmr007-cB,s^na,30b,,,it's cool stuff definitely .
3241.56,3241.9,Bmr007-c8,s^ft,,,,thank you .
3242.24,3242.54,Bmr007-c8,s^ft^r,,,,thank you .
3242.5,3245.38,Bmr007-c1,s,,,,i meant to say that before i started off on the switchboard stuff .
3244.27,3246.03,Bmr007-cB,s^j,31a,,,i was gonna say can you do that for the other meetings .
3245.38,3245.78,Bmr007-c1,s^ba,,,,it's neat .
3246.03,3246.62,Bmr007-cB,qy^j,31a+,,,can you do it for them ?
3246.62,3248.18,Bmr007-cB,s^ar^j,31a++,,,and no actually you can't .
3246.76,3246.88,Bmr007-c1,b,,,,yeah .
3247.27,3247.76,Bmr007-c1,qy.%-,,,,does it take ?==
3247.43,3250.52,Bmr007-c0,s,31b,,,<mm-hmm> actually - actually i - i thought that's what you were giving us was another meeting and i was like oh o_k .
3248.25,3248.57,Bmr007-c8,s^ft,,,,thank you .
3250.09,3250.98,Bmr007-cB,s^fe,,,,ooo cool !
3250.57,3251.1,Bmr007-c8,b,,,,yeah .
3251.1,3251.54,Bmr007-c8,s^ft,,,,aw thanks .
3251.75,3256.3,Bmr007-c1,qw.%-,32a,,,how long does it take just briefly like t- - to - o_k - to label the ?==
3252.36,3252.53,Bmr007-c8,s^ar,,,,no .
3253.66,3254.56,Bmr007-c8,s,32b.33a,,,i have the script now .
3254.56,3256.95,Bmr007-c8,s,32b.33a,,,so i mean it can work off the uh other thing .
3255.33,3258.05,Bmr007-cB,s,33b,,,it's - as soon as we get labels yep .
3256.35,3256.7,Bmr007-c1,b,,,,o_k .
3256.85,3258.25,Bmr007-c0,qy^d,34a,,,but it has to be hand-labeled first ?
3257.47,3257.64,Bmr007-c8,%-,32b++.33a++,,,but ==
3258.63,3259.35,Bmr007-c8,h|s^aa,34b,,,uh well | yeah .
3259.5,3265.21,Bmr007-c8,s,34b+.35a,,,because uh well i mean once his - his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way .
3262.81,3263.78,Bmr007-cB,s,35b-1,,,if it works well enough .
3264.33,3269.88,Bmr007-cB,s,35b-1+,,,right now it's not - not quite to the point where it works .
3265.54,3265.79,Bmr007-c1,s^bk,35b-2,,,o_k .
3265.72,3267.34,Bmr007-c8,s.%--,,,,but i - i just worked off of my ==
3266.09,3266.69,Bmr007-c3,s.%-,,,,o_k go ahead ==
3266.29,3266.83,Bmr007-c1,s^ba,36a,,,it's really neat .
3267.43,3267.73,Bmr007-c8,s^ft,36b,,,thanks .
3267.82,3268.28,Bmr007-c8,s^ft,36b+,,,appreciate that .
3269.29,3273.68,Bmr007-c8,s,,,,i think - what i what - this has uh caused me - so this discussion caused me to wanna subdivide these further .
3273.68,3275.36,Bmr007-c8,s^cc,,,,i'm gonna take a look at the uh backchannels .
3275.36,3277.92,Bmr007-c8,s,,,,how much we have anal- - i hope to have that for next time .
3278.14,3280.55,Bmr007-cB,s^rt,,,,yeah my - my algorithm worked great actually on these .
3278.22,3278.97,Bmr007-c0,s^ba,,,,that'd be interesting .
3280.71,3288.33,Bmr007-cB,s,37a,,,but when you wear it like that or with the uh lapel or if you have it very far from your face that's when it starts failing .
3284.45,3284.91,Bmr007-c0,b,,,,mm-hmm .
3288.87,3290.09,Bmr007-c1,s^cc.%-,37b.38a,,,well i can wear it i mean if you ==
