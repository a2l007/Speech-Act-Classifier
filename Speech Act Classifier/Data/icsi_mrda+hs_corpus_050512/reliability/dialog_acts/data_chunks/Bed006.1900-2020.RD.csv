1891.27,1894.85,Bed006-cA,s^cs,,,{and} {you} {can} {also} {describe} {them} {in} {a} {general} {way} {as} {source} {path} {goal} {schema} .
1894.85,1897.65,Bed006-cA,s^cs,,,{and} {maybe} {there's} {other} {image} {schemas} {that} {you} {could} {you} {know} {add} {after} {this} .
1898.4,1902.63,Bed006-cA,s^e,,,{that} {you} {know} how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics or how do they work in f- - terms of other things .
1901.67,1901.96,Bed006-c2,b,,,{huh} {huh} {huh} {huh} mm-hmm .
1901.96,1902.27,Bed006-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
1902.27,1902.6,Bed006-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
1902.86,1911.44,Bed006-cA,s,,,so all of those have um - basically f- - either specific - frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding .
1911.44,1916.74,Bed006-cA,s,,,so the question is are - um - how to represent when things are linked in a certain way .
1916.94,1919.81,Bed006-cA,s,,,so we know for enter that there's container potentially involved .
1919.81,1921.28,Bed006-cA,%--,,,and it's not ==
1921.97,1926.06,Bed006-cA,fh|s,,,uh - | i don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema s_p_g schema .
1926.06,1928.93,Bed006-cA,s,,,it - it's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container .
1928.93,1936.87,Bed006-cA,s,,,and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source-path-goal um - you know goal - uh - goal i guess in this case .
1937.21,1944.25,Bed006-cA,fh|qy,,,so | uh - is there an easy way in this notation to show when there's identity basically between things ?
1943.46,1943.65,Bed006-c2,b,,,yeah .
1944.25,1947.17,Bed006-cA,s^no.%-,,,and i di- - don't know if that's something we need to invent or you know just ==
1946.91,1950.02,Bed006-c1,qy^bu.%--,,,the - wa- - wasn't there supposed to be a link in the ?==
1947.81,1948.26,Bed006-c5,b,,,right .
1951.04,1952.14,Bed006-c1,s^no,,,i don't know if this answers your question .
1952.14,1953.74,Bed006-c1,s^df,,,i was just staring at this while you were talking .
1953.74,1954.18,Bed006-c1,s^fa,,,sorry .
1955.09,1955.39,Bed006-cA,s^aa,,,it's o_k .
1955.62,1958.81,Bed006-c1,s.%--,,,uh - a link between the action schema ==
1958.81,1965.66,Bed006-c1,s,,,a field in the s- - in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use .
1965.66,1966.17,Bed006-c1,s.%-,,,so we could ==
1965.79,1966.07,Bed006-c2,fg,,,yeah .
1967.15,1971.79,Bed006-c2,fh|s.%--,,,um - | well that's - that's one - one thing is that we can link up ==
1972.53,1982.96,Bed006-c2,s,,,think also that um - we can have one or m- - as many as we want links from - from the schema up to the s- - action um - description of it .
1981.53,1981.79,Bed006-cA,b,,,hmm .
1983.45,2003.15,Bed006-c2,s^bs,,,but the notion i got from nancy's idea was that we may f- - find sort of concepts floating around i- - in the a- - action description of the action f- - enter frame up there that are e- - when you talk about the real world actually identical to the goal of the - the s- - source-path-goal schema .
2001.1,2001.66,Bed006-cA,s^aa,,,exactly .
2002.27,2002.51,Bed006-cA,s^aa,,,right .
2003.02,2003.3,Bed006-cA,s^aa,,,right .
2003.62,2006.6,Bed006-c2,qy,,,and do we have means of - of telling it within that ?
2006.96,2007.24,Bed006-cA,b,,,right .
2007.01,2008.61,Bed006-c2,s,,,a- - and the answer is absolutely .
2008.79,2008.95,Bed006-cA,b,,,yeah .
2009.27,2016.18,Bed006-c2,s,,,the way - we absolutely have those means that are even part of the m_-three-l_ a_ a_p_i meaning we can reference .
2013.44,2013.79,Bed006-cA,s^ba,,,oh great .
2013.79,2013.95,Bed006-cA,%-,,,s- ==
2013.95,2014.23,Bed006-cA,b,,,uh-huh .
2016.33,2016.89,Bed006-c2,s.%-,,,so meaning ==
2016.34,2016.58,Bed006-cA,s^ba,,,great .
2016.79,2019.05,Bed006-cA,s^ba^na,,,that's exactly what is necessary .
2018.44,2018.8,Bed006-c1,b,,,yeah .
2018.45,2018.93,Bed006-c2,fg,,,and um ==
2018.8,2019.58,Bed006-c1,%-,,,st- ==
