187.51,196.506,Bmr007-c8,h|s,,,o_k so | it's indicated to - to - so the people know what parts of sp- - which - which stretches of speech were in the clear versus being overlapped by others .

202.586,206.336,Bmr007-c8,s,,,i wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes .
207.146,210.106,Bmr007-c8,s,,,of which we ended up with forty five and a little bit .
210.856,216.276,Bmr007-c8,s,,,and uh you know minute zero of course is the first minute up to sixty seconds .
