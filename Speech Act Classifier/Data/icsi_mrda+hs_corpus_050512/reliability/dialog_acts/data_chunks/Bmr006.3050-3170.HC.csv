3048,3054.41,Bmr006-c2,s.%-,,,very difficult to apply eh eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see ==
3048.13,3048.36,Bmr006-c3,b,,,yeah .
3053.89,3068.22,Bmr006-c3,fg|s^cs,1a,,well | that - that - that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things - things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are - are better to use than very complex ones because {they'd} be more reliable .
3054.78,3055.95,Bmr006-c2,s.%-,,,but i suppose ==
3059.5,3060.81,Bmr006-c1,s^2,1b-1,,are probably better yep .
3059.51,3059.77,Bmr006-c2,s^aa,1b-2,,yeah .
3059.97,3060.27,Bmr006-c2,s^aa^r,1b-2+,,yeah yeah .
3060.27,3063.32,Bmr006-c2,s,,,i - i - i will put eh the energy here .
3065.31,3065.55,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3067.53,3067.75,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3068.77,3070.12,Bmr006-c3,s^rt^tc,2a,,{chu-} - chuck was gonna ask something i guess .
3069.32,3069.55,Bmr006-c2,s^bk,2b,,yeah .
3069.75,3070.41,Bmr006-c2,qy^d,3a,,you have a question ?
3070.37,3070.89,Bmr006-c0,s^aa.%--,3b,,yeah i {d-} ==
3071.7,3077.64,Bmr006-c0,sj,4a,,maybe this is a dumb question but i thought it would be - i thought it would be easier if you used a p_d_a .
3074.41,3074.76,Bmr006-c3,s^ar,4b,,nah .
3077.96,3084.33,Bmr006-c0,qy^rt,5a,,because can't you couldn't you like use beam-forming or something to- - detect speaker overlaps ?
3084.94,3085.21,Bmr006-c0,s.%--,,,i mean ==
3085.92,3088.72,Bmr006-c1,s^na,5b.6a,,well if you used the array rather than the signal from just one .
3088.89,3089.19,Bmr006-c0,s^bk,6b-1,,uh-huh .
3089.52,3091.15,Bmr006-c3,s^aa,6b-2,,yeah no you- - {you} {re} - you're right .
3090.06,3090.44,Bmr006-c1,s.%--,,,but that's ==
3091.15,3096.39,Bmr006-c3,s^e,,,that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information .
3096.89,3098.28,Bmr006-c3,s^e,,,which we don't have with the one .
3098.72,3100.48,Bmr006-c3,s.%-,,,and - and so that's ==
3100.43,3102.37,Bmr006-c0,qy^rt,7a,,is that not allowed with this project ?
3102.15,3105.63,Bmr006-c3,h|s,7b,,uh | well no i mean we- - we don't have any rules r- - {uh} really .
3105.52,3106.27,Bmr006-c0,s.%--,,,but i didn't mean - i ==
3105.63,3114.19,Bmr006-c3,sj^ba,,,i - i - i think - i think it's - it's - it's a - it's an additional interesting question .
3106.67,3110.19,Bmr006-c0,qy.%-,,,given - given the goal i mean is that violation of the ?==
3109.71,3110.02,Bmr006-c2,b,,,oh .
3110.52,3110.92,Bmr006-c2,b.%,,can't hear the 'no',no .
3114.33,3114.59,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3114.66,3123.52,Bmr006-c3,sj,,,i mean i think you wanna know whether you can do it with one because you know it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to do this with will have two .
3123.64,3124.13,Bmr006-c0,b,,,mm-hmm .
3124.07,3124.45,Bmr006-c2,b.%,,can't hear this either,yeah .
3124.08,3128.42,Bmr006-c3,h|s,,,uh | if on the other hand we show that there's a huge advantage with two well then that could be a real point .
3129.1,3129.37,Bmr006-c2,b.%,,or this!,yeah .
3129.22,3135.3,Bmr006-c3,s,8a,,but we don't even know yet what the effect of detecting - having the ability to detect overlaps is you know maybe it doesn't matter {as} much .
3134.75,3135.08,Bmr006-c0,s^aa,8b,,right .
3135.38,3135.62,Bmr006-c0,s^aa^r,8b+,,right .
3135.7,3135.92,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3136.01,3137.41,Bmr006-c3,s,9a,,so this is all pretty early stages .
3136.07,3136.32,Bmr006-c0,s^bk,8b++,,o_k .
3136.47,3136.79,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3137.41,3138.31,Bmr006-c3,s^aa,,not sure what he's referring to,but no you're absolutely right .
3137.65,3137.89,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3137.69,3138,Bmr006-c0,s^bk,9b,,i see .
3137.89,3139.01,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah yeah yeah .
3138.31,3140.19,Bmr006-c3,sj^ba,10a,,that's a good thing to consider .
3138.89,3139.24,Bmr006-c0,s^bk,10b,,o_k .
3139.28,3145.99,Bmr006-c4,s^ng,11a,,there - there is a complication though and that is if a person turns their back to the - to the p_d_a then some of the positional information goes away .
3146.29,3148.41,Bmr006-c3,s.%-,,,well it - it - it does i- - it d- - it does but ==
3146.4,3146.67,Bmr006-c2,b.%,,,yeah .
3147.07,3149.2,Bmr006-c0,s^ar,11b,,no it's not - it's not that so much as .
3147.25,3147.6,Bmr006-c4,%-,,,and then ==
3148.41,3150.58,Bmr006-c3,s.%-,,,the - the issue is that - that ==
3150.06,3153.98,Bmr006-c4,s,,,and if they're on the access - on the axis of it that was the other thing i was thinking he - you mentioned this last time .
3151.78,3152.09,Bmr006-c1,b.%,,I don't think this is c1!,mm-hmm .
3153.66,3155.75,Bmr006-c1,s^co|fh,,,yeah we {had} - need to put it on a little turntable | and .
3154.22,3159.18,Bmr006-c4,s,,,that - that if - if you're straight down the midline then - then - the - the left-right's gonna be different .
3154.31,3154.77,Bmr006-c2,fg,,,i - i ==
3155.65,3158.65,Bmr006-c2,fg,,,i - i - i th- ==
3157.92,3158.72,Bmr006-c0,fg,,,well it's- ==
3158.65,3158.72,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3159.18,3162.14,Bmr006-c4,s,,,and - and - and in his case i mean he's closer to it anyway .
3160.59,3160.85,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3162.14,3169.05,Bmr006-c4,s,12a,,it seems to me that - that it's not - a p- - uh you know it's - this - the topograph- - the topology of it is - is a little bit complicated .
3162.58,3162.91,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3164.62,3166.13,Bmr006-c1,s^ng,12b,,but it's another source of information .
3165.04,3165.5,Bmr006-c2,fg,,,i - i ==
3167.04,3167.26,Bmr006-c2,b,,,yeah .
3167.54,3168.71,Bmr006-c0,s^no.%-,,,i don't - i don't know ho- ==
3167.68,3168.73,Bmr006-c2,fg,,,i - i - i think ==
3168.85,3169.29,Bmr006-c2,sj^by,,,sorry .
