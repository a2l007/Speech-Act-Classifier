1463.95,1465.6,Bmr027-c0,s,,,there're bound to be some glitches the first time through .
1464.52,1464.98,Bmr027-c1,fh,,,so ==
1465.9,1469.04,Bmr027-c1,fh|s^fa,1a,,and uh - | and i'm sorry responding without uh having much knowledge .
1469.04,1472.13,Bmr027-c1,s^df,1a+,,but the thing is uh i am like one of these people who gets a gazillion mails .
1472.13,1474.07,Bmr027-c1,s^df.%-,,,and - and stuff comes in as ==
1472.77,1474.78,Bmr027-c5,s,1b,,well and that's exactly why i did it the way i did it .
1474.78,1477.46,Bmr027-c5,s^e,1b+,,which is the default is if you do nothing we're gonna release it .
1477.46,1484.26,Bmr027-c5,s^df,1b++,,because you know i have my stack of emails of to d- - to be done that you know fifty or sixty long .
1477.78,1478.09,Bmr027-c1,b,,,yeah .
1484.26,1486.03,Bmr027-c5,s^df,1b+++.2a,,and the ones at the top i'm never gonna get to .
1486.42,1486.78,Bmr027-c1,s^bk,2b-1,,right .
1486.71,1487.31,Bmr027-c5,fh,,,and uh ==
1487.58,1488.3,Bmr027-c2,s^cs^j,2b-2.3a,,move them to the bottom .
1487.89,1488.68,Bmr027-c5,fh,,,so - so ==
1489.39,1489.96,Bmr027-c5,s^bk,3b,,yeah right .
1489.72,1494.03,Bmr027-c1,fg|s:s^bk,,,so - so | the only thing we're missing is - is some way to respond to easily to say uh o_k .
1490.98,1492.27,Bmr027-c5,s.%-,,,so i- - this is gonna mean ==
1493.89,1495.12,Bmr027-c2,s^cs,4a,,just re-mail them to yourself .
1494.03,1495.05,Bmr027-c1,s:s^co,,,go ahead or something .
1495.05,1495.35,Bmr027-c1,b,,,yeah .
1495.12,1495.89,Bmr027-c2,s^df,4a+,,and then they're at the bottom .
1495.13,1495.34,Bmr027-c5,b,,,yeah .
1496.41,1496.56,Bmr027-c5,s^bk,4b,,yeah .
1496.46,1496.71,Bmr027-c0,b,,,yeah .
1496.56,1497.86,Bmr027-c5,s^ba,4b+,,that's actually definitely a good point .
1497.86,1504.01,Bmr027-c5,s^df.%--,4b++.5a,,the m- - email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email as op- - as opposed to going to the form and ==
1503.13,1503.4,Bmr027-cB,%,,,in ==
1503.42,1503.73,Bmr027-c0,b,,,mm-hmm .
1503.81,1504.23,Bmr027-c4,s^bk,5b-1,,right .
1504.2,1511.77,Bmr027-c0,s,5b-2.6a,,and it also doesn't give a - a specific - i didn't think of it - s- - i think it's a good idea - an ex- - explicit time by which this will be considered definite .
1511.03,1511.69,Bmr027-c5,s^bk|s^2,6b,,yeah | release .
1512.36,1514.3,Bmr027-c0,s,5b-2+,,and - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint .
1514.93,1515.12,Bmr027-c1,b,,,yeah .
1515.5,1516.17,Bmr027-c1,s,7a,,it's converging .
1516.63,1516.94,Bmr027-cB,%--,,,this ==
1517.05,1518.63,Bmr027-cB,s,,,um i've seen this recently .

1517.31,1517.67,Bmr027-c0,s^aa,7b+,,that's right .
1518.63,1519.56,Bmr027-cB,s,,,uh i got email .
1519.98,1529.93,Bmr027-cB,s:s^co,8a,,and it i- - if i use a mime-capable mail reader it actually says you know click on this button to confirm receipt of the - of the mail .
1530.79,1531.02,Bmr027-c3,b,,,hmm .
1530.95,1532.54,Bmr027-c0,s^bk|s^ba,8b-1,,oh | that's interesting .
1531.18,1531.74,Bmr027-cB,fh,,,so ==
1531.88,1532.49,Bmr027-c5,s.%--,,,you - you can ==
1532.89,1535.14,Bmr027-c5,s,8b-2.9a,,a lot of mailers support return receipt .
1532.93,1534.36,Bmr027-c3,s,,,it's like certified mail .
1534.05,1534.74,Bmr027-c0,s,8b-1+,,could do that .
1535.15,1535.59,Bmr027-cB,s^bk,9b,,right .
1535.65,1537.42,Bmr027-c5,s^ng,8b-2+.10a,,but it doesn't confirm that they've read it .
1536.9,1537.5,Bmr027-cB,s^ar,10b,,no no no .
1537.5,1538.13,Bmr027-cB,s^nd,10b+,,this is different .
1538.13,1538.68,Bmr027-cB,s.%--,10b++,,this is not ==
1538.68,1545.03,Bmr027-cB,s^df,10b+++.11a,,so i - i know you can tell you know the uh mail delivery agent to - to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox .
1542.92,1543.17,Bmr027-c0,b,,,mmm .
1544.22,1544.54,Bmr027-c5,s^bk,11b,,right .
1545.03,1545.77,Bmr027-cB,s^ar,10b++++,,but - but no .
1545.77,1546.36,Bmr027-cB,s^nd,10b+++++,,this was different .
1546.67,1548.83,Bmr027-cB,s^df.%-,12a,,ins- - in the mail there was a ==
1549.78,1550.51,Bmr027-c5,s^bk|s^2,12b.13a,,oh | just a button .
1549.9,1560.02,Bmr027-cB,fh|s^na,13b.14a,,uh | th- - there was a button that when you clicked on it it would send uh you know a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail .
1550.84,1551.09,Bmr027-c5,b,,,oh yeah .
1559.85,1560.19,Bmr027-c5,s^bk,14b,,yeah .

1560.58,1561.49,Bmr027-c5,s^aa|s^na,14b+,,yeah | we could do that .
1561.49,1562.42,Bmr027-c5,s^ba,14b++,,but i hate that .
1561.63,1567.11,Bmr027-cB,s^df.%-,15a,,but it o- - but it only works for you know mime-capable - you know if you use netscape or something like that for your n- ==
1565.33,1565.63,Bmr027-c5,b,,,yeah .
1566.05,1567.84,Bmr027-c4,s^cs^ng,15b,,you might as well just respond to the mail .
1566.37,1566.61,Bmr027-c1,%,,,and ==
1567.74,1569.16,Bmr027-c1,s,16a,,and we actually need a third thing .
1567.8,1568.03,Bmr027-cB,b,,,right .
1568.01,1568.52,Bmr027-c4,fh,,,i mean ==
1569.16,1570.29,Bmr027-c1,s^df,16a+,,it's not that you've looked at it .
1570.29,1575.43,Bmr027-c1,s^df,16a++,,it's that you've looked at it and - and - and agree with one of the possible actions .
1574.65,1574.87,Bmr027-cB,s^ar,16b,,no no .
1574.87,1575.51,Bmr027-cB,s^nd,16b+.17a,,you can do that .
1575.43,1575.74,Bmr027-c1,qy^d^g^rt,,,right ?
1575.51,1577.55,Bmr027-cB,s^df,16b++.18a,,you know you can put this button anywhere you want .
1576.06,1576.28,Bmr027-c1,qy^bh,17b,,oh ?
1577.55,1584.22,Bmr027-cB,s^df:s,16b+++.19a,,and you can put it the bottom of the message and say here by - you know by clicking on this i - i agree - uh you know i acknowledge .
1577.88,1578.41,Bmr027-c1,s^bk,18b,,oh i see .
1582.74,1585.67,Bmr027-c1,s^2^j,19b,,that i- - i- - my first-born children are yours .

1589.48,1591.8,Bmr027-c5,s,20a,,well i could put a u_r_l in there without any difficulty .
1591.8,1594.55,Bmr027-c5,s^df,20a+,,and even pretty simple mime readers can do that .
1594.62,1596.65,Bmr027-c0,qw,20b.21a,,but why shouldn't they just email back ?
1594.62,1594.87,Bmr027-c5,fh,,,so ==
1596.66,1596.87,Bmr027-c5,s^bk,21b-1,,yeah .

1596.77,1597.74,Bmr027-c0,s^df,,,i don't see there's a problem .

1596.93,1597.21,Bmr027-cB,s^bk,21b-2,,right .
1597.9,1598.51,Bmr027-c0,s^ba,,,it's very nice .
1598.11,1598.83,Bmr027-c1,b,,,yeah .
1598.51,1600.07,Bmr027-c0,s,22a,,i - i like the high-tech aspect of it .
1599.58,1600.14,Bmr027-cB,s^ar,22b,,no no no .
1600.07,1600.51,Bmr027-c0,s.%-,,,but i think ==
1601,1601.94,Bmr027-cB,s^nd,22b+,,i actually don't .
1601.56,1602.23,Bmr027-c0,s,,,i appreciate it .
1602.35,1604.45,Bmr027-cB,s.%--,22b++,,i'm just saying that if ev- ==
1603.11,1604.79,Bmr027-c5,s,,,well i - cuz i use a text mail reader .
1604.36,1605.46,Bmr027-c4,qy^rt,23a,,don't you use v_i ?
1604.45,1604.79,Bmr027-cB,s.%-,,,but i'm ==
1606.75,1607.19,Bmr027-c4,s^e.%--,,,for your mai- ==

1607.93,1608.95,Bmr027-c1,s,24b+,,that's - that's my guy .
1609,1609.38,Bmr027-c1,s,,,alright .
1609.05,1610.89,Bmr027-c5,qy^bu^d^rt,25a,,you - you read email in v_i ?
1609.29,1609.58,Bmr027-cB,s^aa,25b-1,,yeah .
1610.24,1610.47,Bmr027-c0,s^aa,25b-2,,yeah .
1610.95,1612.03,Bmr027-cB,%--,,,so - i - i- ==
1611.36,1611.86,Bmr027-c0,s,,,i like v_i .
1612.2,1616.6,Bmr027-cB,s,26a,,there's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page like powered by v_i .
1617.85,1618.13,Bmr027-c3,s^bk,26b-1,,yeah .
1618.71,1619,Bmr027-c1,s^ba,26b-2,,wow .
1619.24,1620.28,Bmr027-c4,s,,,anyway quick question .
1619.25,1620.69,Bmr027-c5,s^cs,26b-3,,you could put wed bugs in the email .
1619.69,1619.95,Bmr027-c3,s^bk,,,i see .
1620.35,1620.85,Bmr027-c4,qw.%--,,,how m- ?==
1620.41,1620.67,Bmr027-cB,b,,,yeah .
1621.01,1623,Bmr027-c4,s.%--,27a,,like there were three meetings this time or so- ==
1623,1623.78,Bmr027-c4,qw,,,or how many ?
1623.42,1623.85,Bmr027-c0,s,27b.28a,,six .
1623.78,1624.28,Bmr027-c4,qy^bu^d^rt,28b,,six ?
1624.6,1626.32,Bmr027-c4,s,28b+,,but no- - of different people .
1626.32,1628.84,Bmr027-c4,s,,,so i guess if you're in both these types of meetings you'd have a lot .
1628.84,1629.99,Bmr027-c4,%--,,,but how ==
1630.33,1632.26,Bmr027-c4,s.%--,,,i mean it also depends on how many ==
1632.93,1636.2,Bmr027-c4,s,,,like if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings .
1636.19,1638.67,Bmr027-c4,qo,29a,,but what if we release like twenty-five meetings to people ?
1639.32,1646.18,Bmr027-c5,s,29b.30a,,well what my s- - expectation is is that we'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .
1639.66,1639.92,Bmr027-c4,%-,,,in th- ==
1640.72,1641.04,Bmr027-c4,fh,,,i don't know .
1646.43,1646.69,Bmr027-c4,s^bk,30b,,oh .
1646.69,1647.13,Bmr027-c4,s^bk,30b+,,oh o_k .
1647.36,1647.63,Bmr027-c5,fh,,,so ==
1647.56,1649.18,Bmr027-c4,s^bu,31a,,so this time was just the first chunk .
1647.63,1648.75,Bmr027-c5,s^df,30b++,,tha- - that was my intention .
1648.75,1649.06,Bmr027-c5,s.%--,,,it's just ==
1649.06,1651.18,Bmr027-c5,s^aa|s,31b.32a,,yeah - | that we just happened to have a bunch all at once .
1649.26,1649.68,Bmr027-c4,s^bk,32b,,o_k .
1650.44,1651.39,Bmr027-c4,s^ba,,,well that's a good idea .
1651.9,1653.96,Bmr027-c5,qy^rt,33a,,i mean maybe - is that the way it's gonna be you think jane ?
1653.17,1653.76,Bmr027-c0,s^na,,,i agree with you .
1654.13,1657.24,Bmr027-c0,s,33b,,it's - we could do it uh - i- - i could - i'd be happy with either way batch-wise .
1657.24,1657.95,Bmr027-c0,s.%--,,,what i was thinking ==
1657.95,1660.66,Bmr027-c0,s.%--,,,uh so this one that was exactly right that we had a - uh uh ==
1660.96,1664.03,Bmr027-c0,s^rt,,,i - i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready .
1664.5,1665.08,Bmr027-c0,s,,,don't have it .
1665.36,1669.45,Bmr027-c0,s,,,but uh this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable .
1668.91,1669.61,Bmr027-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
1669.45,1671.5,Bmr027-c0,s^df,,,people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then .
1671.94,1680.37,Bmr027-c0,s^cc,,,my um - i was thinking that with the n_s_a meetings i'd like - there are three of them and they're - uh i - i will have them done by monday .
1680.81,1682.48,Bmr027-c0,s,,,uh unfortunately the time is later .
1682.48,1683.69,Bmr027-c0,s^no,,,and i don't know how that's gonna work out .
1683.69,1685.9,Bmr027-c0,s^cs,,,but i thought it'd be good to have that released as a clump too .
1685.9,1689.28,Bmr027-c0,s^df,,,because then you know they're - they - they have a - it- - it's in a category .
1689.28,1691.49,Bmr027-c0,s^df,,,it's not quite so distracting to them is what i was thinking .
1691.59,1692.69,Bmr027-c0,s^df.%--,,,and it's all in one chu- ==
1692.88,1699.67,Bmr027-c0,s,34a,,but after that when we're caught up a bit on this process then um i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available .
1700.26,1700.61,Bmr027-c4,s^bk,34b,,o_k .
1700.82,1701.69,Bmr027-c0,s,,,i could do it either way .
1701.69,1704.44,Bmr027-c0,s^df,,,i mean it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .
1708.49,1709.59,Bmr027-c1,qy^d^rt,35a,,we heard anything from i_b_m ?
1710.36,1710.67,Bmr027-c1,s^e,35a+,,at all .
1710.9,1711.71,Bmr027-c2,h,35b,,uh .
1712.06,1712.62,Bmr027-c2,h,35b+,,let's see .
1712.62,1713.31,Bmr027-c2,%--,35b++,,we ==
1713.31,1713.67,Bmr027-c2,s^bk,35b+++,,yeah right .
1713.67,1715.86,Bmr027-c2,s,35b++++,,so we got the transcript back from that one meeting .
1715.86,1717,Bmr027-c2,s,35b+++++,,everything seemed fine .
1717.12,1719.91,Bmr027-c2,s,35b++++++,,adam had a script that will put everything back together .
1719.91,1721.56,Bmr027-c2,s,35b+++++++,,and there was - well there was one small problem .
1721.56,1722.76,Bmr027-c2,s^bd,35b++++++++,,but it was a simple thing to fix .
1723.47,1727.98,Bmr027-c2,s,35b+++++++++,,and then um we uh - i sent him a pointer to three more .
1728.65,1732.26,Bmr027-c2,s,35b++++++++++,,and so he's off and working on those .
1731.38,1731.55,Bmr027-c5,b,,,yeah .
1731.75,1738.98,Bmr027-c5,s,36a.37a,,now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .
1738.91,1739.71,Bmr027-c0,s,36b,,that's on my list .
1738.98,1740.38,Bmr027-c5,s^cs,37a+,,so at some point we need to do that .
1739.64,1739.8,Bmr027-c2,b,,,yeah .
1740.38,1741.16,Bmr027-c0,s,37b,,well that's on my list .
1741.64,1741.8,Bmr027-c2,fg,,,yeah .
1741.8,1744.32,Bmr027-c2,s,,,it's gonna have to go through our regular process .
1743.8,1746.43,Bmr027-c5,s,,,i mean the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels .
