1998.13,2000.74,Bmr014-c8,s^cs^rt,,,{so} {maybe} {you} {don't} give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .
2001.9,2002.47,Bmr014-cB,s.%--,,,well i guess ==
2002.23,2003.59,Bmr014-c8,fg|s^fa,,,so - so - so | i'm sorry .
2002.63,2004.17,Bmr014-cB,b,,,yeah hmm .
2003.59,2006.1,Bmr014-c8,s,,,so - so - so maybe this is a s- - a way out of it .
2006.1,2008.9,Bmr014-c8,s^rt,,,you've provided something that's useful for you to do - handle .
2009.25,2011.81,Bmr014-c8,s,,,and useful for someone else if they need it .
2012.65,2019.24,Bmr014-c8,s^rt,,,but i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh they get access to this if they really need it .
2013.4,2013.58,Bmr014-c4,%-,,,well ==
2019.86,2024.75,Bmr014-c2,s,1a,,so you're saying the - the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists .
2024.75,2029.6,Bmr014-c2,s,1a+,,contacts them via whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting .
2029.82,2030.01,Bmr014-c8,s^aa^rt,1b,,right .
2030.55,2032.55,Bmr014-c2,s,2a,,and then if they don't you're done .
2032.88,2035.66,Bmr014-c2,s,2a+,,if they do then he provides them access to the - the web site .
2035.92,2036.48,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,w- - w- ==
2036,2037.64,Bmr014-c4,s,2b.3a,,well to some extent i have to do that anyway .
2036.93,2038.3,Bmr014-c2,s,2a+,,or a printed-out form .
2037.64,2039.79,Bmr014-c4,s^df,2b+.3a+,,because as i said we have to distribute passwords .
2039.66,2040.17,Bmr014-c8,s.%--,,,there's - there ==
2040.17,2040.56,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,y- ==
2040.66,2040.95,Bmr014-c4,fh,,,so ==
2041.13,2044.23,Bmr014-c8,s,3b.4a,,but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i'm saying .
2044.83,2045.19,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,so ==
2044.93,2045.43,Bmr014-c4,%-,,,well but ==
2045.98,2046.84,Bmr014-c2,s^e,4b-1,,only if they want it .
2046.41,2048.75,Bmr014-c4,s,4b-2,,what i'm saying is that i can't just email them the password .
2048.75,2049.65,Bmr014-c4,s^df,4b-2+,,because that's not secure .
2049.65,2049.95,Bmr014-c8,s^ar,5b,,no no no .
2049.95,2051.5,Bmr014-c8,s.%--,,,but you aren't necessarily giving them ==
2049.99,2051.66,Bmr014-c4,s,6a,,so they have to call me and ask .
2052.45,2052.83,Bmr014-c8,s^bk,6b,,right .
2053.53,2057.32,Bmr014-c8,s,7a,,but we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .
2054.58,2054.67,Bmr014-c1,b.%,,,{laugh} ?==
2057.75,2058.93,Bmr014-c4,s^nd,7b,,well we do because of privacy .
2058.93,2060.92,Bmr014-c4,s^e,7b+,,we can't just make it openly available on the web .
2060.45,2061.55,Bmr014-c8,s^ar|s^rt,,,no no | you're missing the point .
2060.89,2061.13,Bmr014-cB,b,,,mm-hmm .
2062.11,2069.47,Bmr014-c8,s^rt,,,we're - we're trying i- - we're trying to make it less of an obvious just l- - l- - l- - l- - uh fall off a log to do this .
2069.92,2071.95,Bmr014-cB,s,,,not everyone gets a password unless they ask for it .
2071.17,2071.44,Bmr014-c8,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,right ?
2071.91,2076.2,Bmr014-c8,s,,,so th- - so what i would see is that first you contact them .
2072.56,2072.69,Bmr014-cB,b,,,yeah .
2076.2,2078.99,Bmr014-c8,s^cs.%--,,,and ask them if they would like to review it for - to check for the ==
2078.99,2079.91,Bmr014-c8,s^rt,,,not just for fun .
2080.73,2081.08,Bmr014-c8,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,o_k ?
2081.08,2089.44,Bmr014-c8,s,,,but to - to check this for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it at - from their memory .
2090.29,2095.91,Bmr014-c8,fh|s,,,um and uh | and we should think carefully - actually we should review - go through how that's worded .
2096.26,2096.61,Bmr014-c8,qy^d^f^g^rt,,,o_k ?
2097.44,2100.46,Bmr014-c8,s.%--,,,then if someone uh wants to review it ==
2101.16,2106.21,Bmr014-c8,s,,,uh and i know you don't like this but i'm offering this as a suggestion is that - is that we then give them a print out .
2107.36,2115.94,Bmr014-c8,s:s,8a,,and then if they say that i have a potential problem with these things then you - you say o_k well you might wanna hear this in context to s- - think if you need that .
2116.18,2118.41,Bmr014-c8,s.%-,8a+,,you issue them a password i- - in the ==
2117.58,2122.03,Bmr014-c4,s,8b,,but the - the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them it's inconvenient for me .
2122.77,2128.65,Bmr014-c4,s,,,because that means multiple contacts every time - for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .
2129.52,2131.81,Bmr014-c4,s,9a,,i would much prefer to have all be automatic .
2131.81,2133.45,Bmr014-c4,s,9a+,,they visit the {website} if they want to .
2133.88,2134.97,Bmr014-c4,s^df,9a++,,obviously they don't have to .
2135.26,2136.19,Bmr014-c8,s,9b,,i know you'd prefer it .
2136.25,2136.86,Bmr014-c8,s.%--,,,but the proble- ==
2136.86,2137.19,Bmr014-c8,s.%--,,,we have ==
2137.15,2137.25,Bmr014-c4,fg,,,yeah .
2137.19,2138.07,Bmr014-c8,s,,,there's a problem with it .
2137.64,2141.12,Bmr014-c4,s,10a,,so i think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping .
2141.12,2142.52,Bmr014-c4,s,10a+,,and i just don't think that's gonna happen .
2143.05,2146.49,Bmr014-cB,s,10b,,i'm also concerned about the spirit of the - of the informed consent thing .
2146.49,2150.44,Bmr014-cB,s^df.%--,,,cuz i think if they feel that uh it's - i th- - i th- ==
2150.44,2162.94,Bmr014-cB,s,,,you know if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that .
2163.5,2167.67,Bmr014-cB,s:s,,,um but - but they might be able to argue oh well it was cumbersome .
2167.67,2171.11,Bmr014-cB,s:s,,,and i was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down .
2171.11,2173.38,Bmr014-cB,s,1a,,so it could that the burden would come back onto us .
2173.38,2176.86,Bmr014-cB,s,1a+,,so i'm a little bit worried about uh making it harder for them from the legal standpoint .
2175.61,2177.63,Bmr014-c8,s,1b,,well you can go too far in that direction .
2177.63,2179.61,Bmr014-c8,s,1b,,and you need to find somewhere between i think .
2177.89,2178.18,Bmr014-cB,b,,,yeah .
2179.68,2180.18,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,because ==
2179.74,2185.78,Bmr014-c4,s:s,,,it seems to me that sending them email saying if you have an o_- - o_k reply to this email and say o_k .
2181.72,2182.19,Bmr014-c8,b,,,uh-huh .
2185.78,2188.72,Bmr014-c4,s:s,,,if you have a problem with it contact me and i'll give you a password .
2189.38,2192.62,Bmr014-c4,s,,,seems like is a perfectly reasonable compromise .
2192.62,2194.75,Bmr014-c4,s,2a,,and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .
2195.38,2196.4,Bmr014-cB,s,2b,,or we could print it up for them .
2196.4,2207.79,Bmr014-cB,s,,,i mean we could offer that but - but there's uh another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form um my impression is that they - that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript .
2196.67,2196.94,Bmr014-c1,b,,,yeah .
2207.79,2209.23,Bmr014-cB,s.%--,,,and - and i ha- ==
2209.23,2211.99,Bmr014-cB,s,,,i don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage .
2209.29,2209.55,Bmr014-c8,b,,,yeah .
2212.58,2213.65,Bmr014-cB,s.%--,,,i mean i - i thought that you were ==
2213.84,2215.73,Bmr014-cB,s^bd^df,3a,,maybe i misinterpreted what you said .
2215.72,2219.84,Bmr014-c8,s,3b.4a.5a,,having access to it doesn't necessarily mean that - having it .
2215.73,2216.16,Bmr014-cB,s.%-,,,but it's ==
2218.74,2219.19,Bmr014-c4,s^2,4b-1,,having it .
2219.22,2219.91,Bmr014-cB,s^2,4b-2,,giving it to them .
2219.84,2220.08,Bmr014-c8,qy^d^f^g,3b+.4a+,,right ?
2219.96,2220.25,Bmr014-cB,s^bk,5b,,o_k .
2220.08,2221.69,Bmr014-c8,s^e,,,it just means they have the right to have it .
2220.2,2220.54,Bmr014-c4,s.%--,,,well the in ==
2220.37,2220.64,Bmr014-cB,s^bk,,,alright .
2220.69,2223.11,Bmr014-c4,s,,,the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it .
2221.75,2222.39,Bmr014-cB,s^bk,,,fine o_k .
2222.64,2222.94,Bmr014-cB,s^bk,,,fair enough .
2223.17,2223.4,Bmr014-c4,fh,,,so ==
2223.69,2224,Bmr014-c8,b,,,yeah .
2224.57,2225.65,Bmr014-cB,%-,,,sh- - sh- ==
2224.92,2225.75,Bmr014-c4,qy^rt^t3,6a,,d- - you want me to grab one ?
2225.65,2225.97,Bmr014-cB,s^t3.%--,6b.7a,,well i could ==
2226.09,2226.52,Bmr014-cB,s^t3,6b+.7a+,,i'm closer .
2226.52,2226.73,Bmr014-cB,s.%--,6b++.7a++,,i could ==
2226.86,2227.68,Bmr014-c4,s^bk,7b.8a,,yeah | but you're wired .

2227.83,2228.28,Bmr014-cB,s^na,8b,,yeah that is true .
2231.86,2234.53,Bmr014-c8,fg|s^df,,,um yeah | i mean i don't wanna fool them .
2232.72,2233.28,Bmr014-cB,s^no.%--,,,i don't know ==
2234.77,2241.24,Bmr014-c8,s,9a,,i just meant that e- - every - ev- - any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a - a bias that is presented .
2235.66,2236.06,Bmr014-cB,s^aa,9b,,oh yeah yeah .
2236.06,2236.48,Bmr014-cB,sj^ba,,,oh i know .
2241.43,2241.78,Bmr014-c8,qy^d^f^g^rt,9a+,,right ?
2241.48,2242.03,Bmr014-cB,s^aa^rt,,,yeah that's true .
2241.78,2242.89,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,of - and ==
2242.22,2248.39,Bmr014-c4,s:s,,,if you agree to participate you'll have the opportunity to have anything ex- - anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set .
2242.23,2242.42,Bmr014-cB,b,,,yeah .
2248.67,2248.84,Bmr014-c8,b^rt,,,yeah .
2249.04,2253.92,Bmr014-c4,s,,,once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r- - larger research community .
2254.29,2258.05,Bmr014-c4,s,,,there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you'd prefer to have excised from the database .
2258.37,2261.24,Bmr014-c4,s,10a,,and they will m- - be removed both from the transcript and the recording .
2261.74,2261.91,Bmr014-cB,s^bk,10b,,hmm .
2262.02,2263.69,Bmr014-cB,sj^ba,10b+,,well that's more open than i realized .
2264.28,2264.72,Bmr014-c4,s.%--,,,well i mean it ==
2265.29,2268.78,Bmr014-c4,s,,,the one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .
2265.41,2265.8,Bmr014-c8,%--,,,i ==
2267.83,2268.23,Bmr014-c1,b,,,yeah .

2268.85,2269.43,Bmr014-cB,s,,,tha- - that's true .

2269.43,2272.72,Bmr014-cB,s,1a,,that's more severe but the next one says the transcript will be around .
2270.34,2270.8,Bmr014-c8,s,,,that's right .
2272.72,2274.46,Bmr014-cB,s,1a+,,and it doesn't really say we'll send it to you .
2274.46,2276.86,Bmr014-cB,s,1a++,,or wi- - it'll be available for you on the web or anything .
2276.4,2278.99,Bmr014-c2,s^ng,1b,,i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them .
2277.14,2277.49,Bmr014-c8,%-,,,i- - i ==
2278.47,2279.31,Bmr014-cB,s,,,at least it more often .

2284.24,2286.54,Bmr014-c4,s,,,they just have to make sure that it is available to them .
2286.21,2287.7,Bmr014-cB,s,,,it's available to them if they ask for it .
2288.43,2288.8,Bmr014-c8,s^bk,,,yeah .

2289.89,2298.94,Bmr014-c8,s,,,i think i have an idea that may be sat- - may satisfy both you and me in this which is um it's a - it - we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded .
