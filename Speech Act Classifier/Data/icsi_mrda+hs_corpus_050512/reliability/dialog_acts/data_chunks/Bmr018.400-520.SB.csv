399.798,400.048,Bmr018-c0,s^bk,,,o_k .
400.414,400.644,Bmr018-c2,qy^d^g^rt,,,right ?
401.08,402,Bmr018-c1,qy^d^rt,,,as of what point ?
405.029,405.429,Bmr018-c1,s.%--,,,i mean ==
405.93,411.87,Bmr018-c1,qy,1a,,the - i guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i_b_m ?
411.87,413.45,Bmr018-c1,qrr,,,or do we go ahead and send them a sample ?
413.8,414.59,Bmr018-c2,%--,1b,,why wouldn't we s- - {@reject@} {@reject@} {@reject@} {@reject@} w- ==
414.088,414.658,Bmr018-c1,%-,,,let their ==
414.71,419.42,Bmr018-c2,qh.%--,1b+,,i- - they - {if} were going sequentially through it why wouldn't we give them ?==
419.53,422.31,Bmr018-c2,qy,1b++.2a,,i mean i- - are we trying to get something done by the time brian comes ?
422.57,423.89,Bmr018-c1,s^no,2b-1,,well i - i - i mean i don't know .
423.514,424.294,Bmr018-c4,s,2b-2,,that was the question .
424.564,424.774,Bmr018-c4,%--,,,though ==
425.12,432.26,Bmr018-c2,s,3a,,so if we - if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to would be better than nothing .
427.32,427.48,Bmr018-c1,b,,,yeah .
429.479,429.929,Bmr018-c1,%-,,,uh - that ==
430.029,430.549,Bmr018-c1,s^na,3b,,i agree .
430.919,431.299,Bmr018-c1,s^na^r,,,i agree .
431.594,432.344,Bmr018-c4,s.%--,,,well i don't think ==
432.57,434.31,Bmr018-c4,qo,4a,,i mean h- - they - they typically work for what ?
434.31,434.87,Bmr018-c4,s^e^rt,4a+,,four hours .
434.87,435.6,Bmr018-c4,s^e^rt,4a++,,something like that .
436,436.87,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,4b,,hmm i gue- - hmm .
437.163,439.843,Bmr018-c4,s,,,i think the- - they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting .
441.061,441.611,Bmr018-c4,s^rt,,,i would think .
441.611,443.291,Bmr018-c4,s^df,,,unless it's a lot harder than we think it is .
443.291,444.811,Bmr018-c4,s^bd,,,which it could be certainly .
445.617,447.807,Bmr018-c0,s,5a,,if it's got like for speakers .
447.807,451.144,Bmr018-c0,s.%--,,,then i guess - i mean if ==
450.038,451.514,Bmr018-c0,%--,,,{hhh} ==
450.57,452.35,Bmr018-c4,s,5b,,or seven or eight .
450.96,452.66,Bmr018-c1,s^bu,6a,,we're just doing the individual channels .
452.66,452.91,Bmr018-c1,qy^d^g^rt,6a+,,right ?
453.599,455.349,Bmr018-c0,s^m|s^aa^rt,6b,,individual channels | yeah .
455.82,459.84,Bmr018-c1,s.%-,,,so it's gonna be depending on the number of people in the meeting um ==
460.09,467.39,Bmr018-c0,s.%--,,,i guess there is this issue of you know if - if the segmenter thought there was no speech on - on a particular stretch on a particular channel ==
460.64,460.85,Bmr018-c4,%-,,,well ==
467.39,474.873,Bmr018-c0,s^rt,,,and there really was then if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify then it might be overlooked .
475.36,481.205,Bmr018-c0,qh,,,so i mean the question is should - should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g- - can it be based on the mixed signal ?
481.325,484.755,Bmr018-c0,s,7a,,and i th- - eh - so far as i'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point .
484.825,485.205,Bmr018-c0,fh,,,and ==
484.88,490.39,Bmr018-c4,s,7b.8a,,that's what it seems to me too in that if they need to just like in the other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to .
486.33,487.4,Bmr018-c0,s,,,and that cuts down the time .
490.54,490.85,Bmr018-c0,s^aa,8b,,yeah .
491.168,492.568,Bmr018-c4,s^e,9a,,but they don't have to for most of it .
493.13,493.59,Bmr018-c0,s^aa|s^ba,9b-1,,yeah | that's good .
493.76,494.18,Bmr018-c0,fg,,,so yeah .
493.99,495.44,Bmr018-c1,s^nd,9b-2.10a,,i don't see how that will work though .
494.31,494.85,Bmr018-c0,s^ba,,,good good good .
496.13,496.98,Bmr018-c0,qw,10b,,what - what aspect ?
496.53,498.67,Bmr018-c2,s^bu,11a,,so you're talking about tightening up time boundaries .
498.44,498.7,Bmr018-c1,s^aa,11b,,yeah .
499.11,504.81,Bmr018-c4,s,,,so they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line .
499.18,499.65,Bmr018-c2,qw.%-,,,so how do you ?==
505.185,505.445,Bmr018-c1,b,,,yeah .
505.512,506.762,Bmr018-c4,s,,,but you're listening to the mixed signal .
506.762,509.522,Bmr018-c4,s,,,and you're tightening the boundaries correcting the boundaries .
509.522,510.682,Bmr018-c4,s,12a,,you shouldn't have to tighten them too much .
510.682,512.522,Bmr018-c4,s^df,12a+,,because thilo's program does that .
511.323,512.173,Bmr018-c0,s^ba,12b-1,,should be pretty good .
512.553,512.843,Bmr018-c0,b,,,yeah .
512.56,514.96,Bmr018-c3,s^arp,12b-2,,except for it doesn't do well on short things .
515.2,515.72,Bmr018-c3,s^co,,,remember .
515.25,516.68,Bmr018-c4,s^aa|s.%-,,,right | so - so you'll have to i ==
516.05,516.98,Bmr018-c3,s,13a,,it will miss them .
516.98,519.08,Bmr018-c3,s^e,13a+,,it will miss most of the really short things .
519.07,519.33,Bmr018-c4,s^bk,13b,,uh-huh .
