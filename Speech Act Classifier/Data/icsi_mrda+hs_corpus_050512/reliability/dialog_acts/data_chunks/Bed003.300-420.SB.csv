299.44,300.15,Bed003-c4,s,,,there's a lot of those .
301.27,305.54,Bed003-c2,s,,,but if you looked at it real close you could see the - the in- - intricacy of the of the walls .
305.32,305.54,Bed003-c4,s^bk,,,o_k .
305.54,307.48,Bed003-c4,s^bu,6a,,so that count as - counts as a nice wall .
307.76,308.01,Bed003-c2,s^aa,6b.7a,,right .
308.036,308.156,Bed003-c4,%-,,,the ==
308.156,308.446,Bed003-c4,s^bk,7b,,o_k .
308.2,308.54,Bed003-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
309.204,309.454,Bed003-c4,b,,,right .
310.097,312.857,Bed003-c4,s^bu,8a,,something you want to inspect at close range because it's interesting .
310.19,310.55,Bed003-c1,%-,,,the ==
311.84,312.36,Bed003-c2,s^aa,8b.9a,,exactly .
312.857,313.037,Bed003-c4,s^bk,9b,,o_k .
314.036,314.416,Bed003-c1,b,,,hmm .
314.43,314.67,Bed003-c2,qy^d,,,robert ?
315.156,317.886,Bed003-c1,s,,,well there - there is a term that's often used .
317.886,321.196,Bed003-c1,s^rt,,,that's saliency or the salience of an object .
322.392,326.132,Bed003-c1,s,,,and i was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as {landmarkiness} .
328.498,329.258,Bed003-c1,s,,,but it's really not .
329.518,331.268,Bed003-c1,s,10a,,i mean - an object can be very salient .
329.964,330.734,Bed003-c4,b,,,hmm .
331.308,333.938,Bed003-c1,s^2,10b.1a,,but not a landmark at all .
331.611,332.781,Bed003-c4,s^m,1b,,not a landmark at all .
333.78,336.87,Bed003-c4,s.%--,,,there's landmark for um - touristic reasons and landmark for ==
336.87,337.21,Bed003-c4,s^no,,,i don't know .
337.21,338.99,Bed003-c4,s,,,navigational reasons or something .
338.197,338.517,Bed003-c2,b,,,right .
338.449,338.779,Bed003-c1,b,,,yep .
338.782,338.942,Bed003-c3,b,,,yeah .
338.942,340.372,Bed003-c3,s,2a,,we meant uh - touristic reasons .
340.3,340.67,Bed003-c2,b,,,yeah .
340.71,341.15,Bed003-c4,s^bk,2b,,o_k .
341.26,341.72,Bed003-c1,b,,,hmm .
341.68,341.96,Bed003-c2,b,,,right .
341.895,342.155,Bed003-c4,b,,,o_k .
342.615,346.685,Bed003-c4,s^bu,3a,,but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth- - both kinds of things there for different um - goals .
345.282,345.482,Bed003-c1,b,,,hmm .
346.56,346.74,Bed003-c3,b,,,yeah .
347.265,347.415,Bed003-c4,qy^d^g,3a+,,right ?
347.3,347.64,Bed003-c2,s^aa,3b,,right .
348.432,348.712,Bed003-c2,s^arp.%--,,,but ==
349.37,349.57,Bed003-c2,b,,,yeah .
350.045,351.515,Bed003-c2,s.%--,,,tourist-y landmarks also happen to be ==
352.425,353.485,Bed003-c2,qy.%--,,,wouldn't - couldn't they also be ?==
353.685,354.705,Bed003-c2,s^bu,4a.5a,,they're not exclusive groups .
354.705,354.905,Bed003-c2,qy^g,4a+,,are they ?
355.613,357.523,Bed003-c2,s.%--,,,like non-tourist-y {touristy} landmarks and ==
356.145,357.315,Bed003-c1,s.%-,,,or it can be als- ==
358.611,359.661,Bed003-c4,qy^m^rt,5b.6a,,they're not mutually exclusive ?
358.85,359.71,Bed003-c2,s.%-,,,direct navigational ==
359.71,360.03,Bed003-c2,s^aa,6b.7a,,yeah .
360.48,360.82,Bed003-c4,s^aa,7b.8a,,right .
360.988,361.158,Bed003-c2,s^bk,8b,,o_k .
361.25,361.59,Bed003-c4,s^aa,8a+,,right .
361.59,362.05,Bed003-c4,s^aa,7b+.8a++,,definitely .
363.62,371.91,Bed003-c2,fg|s,,,o_k | so our initial idea was not very satisfying because - uh - our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node .
373.243,373.783,Bed003-c2,fh.%-,,,uh ==
374.96,375.95,Bed003-c4,s^bu,9a,,so a big flat structure .
376.03,376.15,Bed003-c4,qy^d^g,9a+,,right ?
376.166,376.556,Bed003-c2,s^aa,9b-1,,right .
376.703,376.883,Bed003-c3,s^aa,9b-2,,yep .
378.344,379.604,Bed003-c2,s.%--,,,and uh - so we ==
380.776,385.037,Bed003-c2,s,10a,,reasons being you know - it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that .
386.372,392.556,Bed003-c2,s,10a+,,if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort uh - according bhaskara we'd be handicapped .
393.126,395.02,Bed003-c2,s^no,,,i don't know belief-nets very well .
393.848,395.298,Bed003-c3,s.%--,10b,,well usually i mean - you know - n_ ==
395.89,398.98,Bed003-c3,s,10b+.1a,,if you have n_ features then it's two to the n_ - or - exponential in n_ .
400.19,401.05,Bed003-c2,sj^2,1b.2a,,and they wouldn't look pretty .
401.661,402.091,Bed003-c2,s.%--,,,so ==
402.036,402.346,Bed003-c3,s^aa,2b,,yeah .
402.506,404.056,Bed003-c3,s,,,they'd all be like pointing to the one node .
403.969,404.319,Bed003-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
406.461,406.921,Bed003-c2,fh.%--,,,uh ==
407.897,409.487,Bed003-c2,s,,,so then our next idea was to add a middle layer .
409.487,409.687,Bed003-c2,qy^d^f^g,,,right ?
410.281,417.603,Bed003-c2,s.%--,,,so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we've drawn from the communication of some - like - the someone s- ==
