2401.9,2402.25,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2402.63,2410.47,Bed015-c5,s,,,and i left the slot predications open because you can have um things like the guy i know from school .
2410.47,2417.65,Bed015-c5,s:s,,,or you know like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na- - amounts of prep- - you know predications that you might make .
2410.48,2411.02,Bed015-c4,b.%,,,mm-hmm .
2418.11,2420.96,Bed015-c5,fh|s.%--,,,and | it's unclear whether ==
2420.96,2425.37,Bed015-c5,s|qy^d^g^rt,,,i mean you could just have in your scenario here are some extra few things that are true | right ?
2425.61,2426.02,Bed015-c4,b.%,,,mm-hmm .
2425.82,2428.3,Bed015-c5,s,,,and then you could just sort of not have this slot here .
2428.65,2428.78,Bed015-c5,qy^d^g^rt,,,right ?
2428.78,2428.98,Bed015-c5,%--,,,you're ==
2429.06,2429.33,Bed015-c5,fh,,,but ==
2430.16,2431.84,Bed015-c5,s,1a,,but it's used for identification purposes .
2431.84,2436.22,Bed015-c5,s^df,2a,,so it's - it's a little bit different from just saying all these things are true from my utterance .
2431.85,2432.13,Bed015-c4,s^bk,1b-1,,yeah .
2431.94,2432.29,Bed015-c2,s^bk,1b-2,,right .
2435.96,2436.2,Bed015-c4,s^bk,2b,,yeah .
2437.23,2437.63,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2437.91,2438.18,Bed015-c4,s^bk,2b+,,right .
2438.18,2443.33,Bed015-c4,s:s,2b++.3a,,this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy .
2443.66,2444.95,Bed015-c4,s:s,2b+++.3a+,,i know him from school .
2444.95,2446.2,Bed015-c4,s:s,2b++++.3a++,,and he came over for dinner .
2446.2,2448.03,Bed015-c4,s,2b+++++.3a+++,,that's not the same effect .
2447.3,2447.64,Bed015-c5,s^aa,3b,,yeah .
2447.64,2449.19,Bed015-c5,s^na|qy^d^g,3b+,,it's a little bit - it's a little bit different | right ?
2449.19,2449.53,Bed015-c5,fh,,,so ==
2450.01,2452.06,Bed015-c5,s^am,,,or maybe that's like a restrictive non-restrictive .
2452.06,2454.51,Bed015-c5,s^df.%--,,,you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for ==
2452.47,2452.75,Bed015-c4,b,,,yeah .
2455.05,2461.32,Bed015-c5,fh|s^am,,,um | but maybe i'm mixing you know - this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .
2461.32,2468.83,Bed015-c5,s:s,,,so you might imagine that the information you pass to you know - in identifying a particular referent would be oh some - you know it's a guy .
2461.33,2461.69,Bed015-c4,b,,,mm-hmm .
2468.83,2469.94,Bed015-c5,s:s,,,and it's someone i know from school .
2469.94,2480.07,Bed015-c5,s^am,,,so maybe that would you know be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc- - to the whatever construal engine or whatever discourse context to find - you know either create this reference .
2470.11,2470.29,Bed015-c4,b,,,yeah .
2480.07,2481.36,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,in which case it'd be created here .
2480.28,2481,Bed015-c4,b.%,,,mm-hmm .
2481.36,2481.53,Bed015-c5,fh,,,and ==
2482.02,2483.91,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,you know so - so you could imagine that this might not ==
2483.97,2487.59,Bed015-c5,s,,,so uh i'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .
2487.42,2491.59,Bed015-c0,fg|s,,,but - | to make it m- - precise at least in my mind uh it's not precise .
2487.6,2488.32,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2491.97,2494.96,Bed015-c0,qy^bu^d^rt,4a.5a,,so house is gender neuter ?
2496.77,2498.2,Bed015-c5,h|s^na.%-,4b,,um | it could be in ==
2497.26,2498.15,Bed015-c0,s^e^rt,5a+,,in reality .
2498.59,2499.14,Bed015-c0,s^e.%-,,,or in ==
2498.74,2499.45,Bed015-c2,s^nd,5b.6a,,semantically .
2500.19,2501.26,Bed015-c5,s^m^na|s^aa,6b-1,,semantically | yeah .
2500.43,2501.06,Bed015-c0,s^bk^m,6b-2,,semantically .
2501.57,2501.99,Bed015-c0,fh,,,so ==
2501.6,2502,Bed015-c5,b,,,yeah .
2502.69,2503.49,Bed015-c5,%--,,,so it ==
2503.68,2504.61,Bed015-c5,fh|s^e,6b-1+,,uh uh | a table .
2505.78,2505.99,Bed015-c5,fh,,,you know .
2506.73,2508.15,Bed015-c5,s^df,6b-1++,,a thing that c- - doesn't have a gender .
2508.15,2508.37,Bed015-c5,fh,,,so ==
2508.37,2509.81,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,uh it could be that ==
2509.81,2510.23,Bed015-c5,fh,,,i mean ==
2511.26,2513.01,Bed015-c5,s^am.%--,,,maybe you'd - maybe not all these ==
2513.23,2518.96,Bed015-c5,s,7a,,i mean i wou- - i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most - most things .
2518.64,2519.05,Bed015-c0,fg,,,no .
2519.05,2525.13,Bed015-c0,s,7b.8a,,just to make sure that we - everybody that's - completely agreed that it - it has nothing to do with uh form .
2520,2520.39,Bed015-c5,s^bk,8b,,yeah .
2521.6,2521.81,Bed015-c5,s^bk,8b+,,o_k .
2521.81,2523.56,Bed015-c5,s.%-,8b++,,that is semantic as opposed to ==
2524.14,2524.58,Bed015-c5,s^bk,8b+++,,yeah .
2525.02,2525.26,Bed015-c5,s^bk,8b++++,,yeah .
2525.82,2526.14,Bed015-c5,s^aa,8b+++++,,that's right .
2527.14,2527.68,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2531.15,2531.87,Bed015-c5,s.%-,,,s- - so again ==
2531.28,2537.31,Bed015-c0,s,9a,,then predications makes sense to - to have it open for something like uh accessibility or not .
2534.59,2535.94,Bed015-c5,s^2,9b,,open to various things .
2537.31,2537.37,Bed015-c0,b.%,,,yeah .
2538.1,2538.39,Bed015-c5,s^aa,9b+,,right .
2539.92,2540.29,Bed015-c5,fg,,,o_k .
2540.29,2540.95,Bed015-c5,fh,,,so ==
2541.12,2541.4,Bed015-c5,fh,,,let's see .
2541.4,2550.84,Bed015-c5,fh|qy^rt,10a,,so | maybe having made that big sca- - sort of like large scale comment should i just go through each of these slots - uh each of these blocks um a little bit ?
2551.74,2552.02,Bed015-c4,s^aa.%,10b,,sure .
2552,2556.33,Bed015-c5,fh|s,,,um | mostly the top one is sort of image schematic .
2556.81,2562.22,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,and just a note which was that um - s- - so when we actually ha- ==
2562.22,2566.38,Bed015-c5,s,,,so for instance um some of them seem more inherently static .
2566.49,2566.8,Bed015-c5,qy^d^f^g,,,o_k ?
2566.8,2569.88,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,like a container or sort of support-ish .
2570.3,2573.69,Bed015-c5,s,,,and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic .
2573.93,2575.99,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,like source path goal is often thought of that way .
2576.33,2577.07,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,or force .
2577.07,2577.65,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,or something like that .
2577.97,2583,Bed015-c5,s,,,but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that .
2583,2586.91,Bed015-c5,s,,,and different x_schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic .
2587.11,2590.07,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,so path you could just be talking about the path between this and this .
2589.39,2589.83,Bed015-c4,b,,,mmm .
2590.07,2592.24,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,and you know container that you can go in and out .
2592.24,2592.72,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,all of these things .
2592.72,2593.14,Bed015-c5,fh,,,and so ==
2593.6,2607.57,Bed015-c5,fh|s,,,um | i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day - the spaniettes as we called them - um to decide like how you want to split up like s- - image schematic contributions versus like x_schematic contributions .
2607.57,2608.25,Bed015-c5,s^df,,,how do you link them up .
2608.52,2613.47,Bed015-c5,s:qr,,,and i think again um it's gonna be something in the x_schema that tells you is this static or is this dynamic .
2613.47,2614.31,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,so we definitely need ==
2614.52,2616.9,Bed015-c5,s,,,that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that .
2617.28,2617.67,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2618.79,2620.39,Bed015-c5,qy^df,,,that you know is it uh a state ?
2620.39,2621.36,Bed015-c5,qrr^df,,,or is it a change of state ?
2621.36,2623.42,Bed015-c5,qrr^df,,,or is it a um action of some kind ?
2624.03,2629.97,Bed015-c0,fg|qy^rt,11a,,uh | i- - i- - i- - is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?
2624.29,2624.82,Bed015-c5,s^bk,,,uh yeah .
2630.81,2631.2,Bed015-c0,s^e.%-,,,just means ==
2630.93,2631.31,Bed015-c5,s^bk^fe,11b,,oh oh !
2631.31,2632.34,Bed015-c5,qy^bu^d^rt,11b+.12a,,you mean in the slot ?
2632.69,2632.96,Bed015-c0,s^aa,12b,,mm-hmm .
2632.73,2633.77,Bed015-c5,fh|s^ar,11b++,,um | no .
2633.77,2636.13,Bed015-c5,s^df,11b+++,,it's like x_sc- - it's - it's like i was thinking of type constraints .
2636.13,2637.93,Bed015-c5,s,11b++++,,but x_schema well it obviously has to be an x_schema .
2638.35,2642.23,Bed015-c5,s^df,11b+++++,,agent i mean the - the performer of the x_schema that s- - depends on the x_schema .
2642.23,2644.57,Bed015-c5,s.%-,11b++++++,,you know and i - in general it would probably be you know ==
2644.46,2648.1,Bed015-c4,s^bu,13a,,so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .
2646.9,2647.37,Bed015-c5,s^aa,13b.14a,,yeah .
2647.7,2648.4,Bed015-c5,s^na,13b+.14a+,,basically .
2648.41,2648.82,Bed015-c0,b,,,mm-hmm .
2648.52,2648.81,Bed015-c4,s^bk,14b,,o_k .
2648.73,2650.31,Bed015-c5,s,13b++,,um aspectual type probably isn't obvious .
2650.31,2652.35,Bed015-c5,s^df,13b+++,,but i should have - so i just neglected to stick something in .
2651.82,2652.53,Bed015-c1,b,,,mmm .
2652.55,2654.33,Bed015-c5,s^e,,,perspective actor undergoer observer .
2654.33,2654.7,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2655.44,2657.72,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,i think we've often used agent patient obser- ==
2656.51,2656.91,Bed015-c4,s^fe,15a,,whee !
2657.36,2658.22,Bed015-c4,s^bu|qy^d^g^rt,15a+,,that's that one | right ?
2657.72,2658.5,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,15b,,yeah | exactly .
2659.7,2660.2,Bed015-c5,s^na^r,15b+,,exactly .
2660.44,2675.62,Bed015-c5,fh|s,,,um | and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this example of like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch- - you know - definitely it is one way to - for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object .
2675.9,2680.05,Bed015-c5,s:qy^rt,,,and so then we talked about you know whether well does that specify topic as well .
2680.05,2681.14,Bed015-c5,s:s^am,,,well maybe there are other things .
2681.14,2683.51,Bed015-c5,s^df,,,you know now that it's - subject is more like a topic .
2683.51,2684.08,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,and now that you know ==
2684.76,2685.05,Bed015-c5,fg,,,anyway .
2685.05,2685.47,Bed015-c5,s^fa,,,so sorry .
2685.47,2688.04,Bed015-c5,s^cc^rt,,,i'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it's not that f- - important right now .
2688.47,2688.91,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2688.66,2695.12,Bed015-c2,s,16a,,n- - now for the moment we just need the ability to l- - l- - write it down if - if somebody figured out what the rules were .
2691.44,2692.03,Bed015-c5,s^2.%--,16b,,to know how ==
2694.25,2694.66,Bed015-c5,s^aa,16b+,,yeah .
2694.95,2695.32,Bed015-c5,s^aa^r,16b++,,yeah .
2695.3,2695.45,Bed015-c2,fh,,,yeah .
2695.32,2695.9,Bed015-c5,s^na,16b+++,,exactly .
2696.15,2696.75,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2697.62,2698.53,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,some of these other ones ==
2698.53,2698.85,Bed015-c5,fh,,,let's see .
2698.85,2699.27,Bed015-c5,fh,,,so ==
2700.22,2703,Bed015-c5,s^no,,,uh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts .
2703,2704.99,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,needs to be merged,so polarity uh is using for like ==
2703.18,2703.61,Bed015-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
