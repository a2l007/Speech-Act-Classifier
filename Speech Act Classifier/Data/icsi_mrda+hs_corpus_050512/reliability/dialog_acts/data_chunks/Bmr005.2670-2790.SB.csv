2724.76,2725.5,Bmr005-c2,qrr.%-,9a+,,or - every ?==

2736.85,2738.11,Bmr005-c4,s,,,and we're recording those .
2738.75,2744.29,Bmr005-c4,fh|s,10a,,uh - | there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded .
2743.94,2744.33,Bmr005-c2,sj^ba,10b,,great .

2749.01,2752.01,Bmr005-c4,s,,,so actually we're gonna start having a - a pretty significant chunk .
2752.01,2752.23,Bmr005-c4,fh,,,and ==
2752.75,2757.44,Bmr005-c4,s,,,so you know - adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy .
2757.44,2758.96,Bmr005-c4,s,,,and come up quicker when they do crash .

2762.74,2767.03,Bmr005-c4,s,,,so right now i - i'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings .
2767.59,2769.73,Bmr005-c4,s,,,but there are scattered other meetings in it .
2769.73,2771.32,Bmr005-c4,s,,,and that - that amount is gonna grow .
2771.59,2774.38,Bmr005-c4,fh|s.%--,,,uh - so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately ==
2774.95,2779.47,Bmr005-c4,s,,,i- - if {we} - if we collect fifty or sixty hours {of} the meeting meetings it will probably be you know - twenty or thirty percent of it .
2779.47,2781.22,Bmr005-c4,s,,,not - not - not eighty or ninety .
2781.43,2781.61,Bmr005-c4,fh,,,but ==
2782.07,2784.5,Bmr005-c2,s^bu,11a,,so there's probably - there's three to four a week .
2785.58,2786.34,Bmr005-c8,s,11b.12a,,{it's} what we're aiming for .
2786.01,2786.98,Bmr005-c2,s^bk^m,12b,,that we're aiming for .
