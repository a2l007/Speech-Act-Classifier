698.281,702.981,Bro007-c1,s^cs,1a,,and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .
704.117,706.467,Bro007-c2,s^aap|fh,1b.2a,,yeah it's - it's significantly worse | well but .
707.167,707.307,Bro007-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
707.957,709.907,Bro007-c1,s^r,2b.3a,,it's significantly worse .
709.907,712.867,Bro007-c1,%--,,,it's - it's uh ==
710.705,714.025,Bro007-c2,s^arp^rt,3b,,exc- - except for the h_m .
713.368,715.248,Bro007-c3,s,,,for many a mismatch it's worse .
714.025,714.355,Bro007-c2,fh,,,but ==
715.1,716.47,Bro007-c1,s,,,it's - it's mostly worse .
717.19,717.54,Bro007-c1,fh,,,yeah .
718.725,719.505,Bro007-c1,s,,,but it is {a} little .
719.765,721.895,Bro007-c1,s,,,i mean not - not by a huge amount .
721.895,722.455,Bro007-c1,s^no,,,i don't know .
723.692,726.382,Bro007-c1,qw^rt,4a,,what are - what are the sizes of any of these sets ?
726.382,729.082,Bro007-c1,s,,,i - i'm - i'm sure you told me before but i've forgotten .
729.942,737.431,Bro007-c1,fh|qw,4a+,,so - | you know how many words are in uh - one of these test sets ?
730.045,730.425,Bro007-c2,h,,,uh ==
737.491,738.211,Bro007-c3,s^no,4b-1,,i don't remember .
739.091,747.919,Bro007-c2,h|s^rt,4b-2,,um - | it's - it depends - well - the well matched is generally larger than the other sets .
739.555,740.065,Bro007-c1,s^e,4a++,add-on to the question above,about .
749.2,756.065,Bro007-c2,sj,4b-2+.5a,,and i think it's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps at least .
752.157,752.777,Bro007-c3,%--,,,ye- ==
754.922,756.092,Bro007-c3,qy^d^ng^rt,5b.6a,,but words ?
756.845,757.025,Bro007-c2,br^rt,6b.7a,Not sure which question marking to put - essentially this is "what was that?",hmm ?
757.602,757.942,Bro007-c3,qy^bu^d^rt,7b,,well word ?
758.432,758.952,Bro007-c3,s^no,5b+,,i don't know .
759.315,759.985,Bro007-c2,s^aa^r,7b.8a,,the words yeah .
759.542,760.262,Bro007-c3,s^ng,8b.9a,,sentences .
759.985,761.915,Bro007-c2,s^m,9b,,s- - sentences .
762.345,764.215,Bro007-c2,s,10a,,some sets have five hundred sentences .
764.925,765.255,Bro007-c2,fh,,,so ==
764.991,765.291,Bro007-c3,s^aa,10b.11a,,yeah .
766.53,767.17,Bro007-c2,s^bk,11b,,mmm .
766.718,771.678,Bro007-c1,s,,,so the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences let's say .
772.048,775.448,Bro007-c1,qy^bu^d^rt,12a,,and each sentence on the average has four or five digits ?
775.448,777.268,Bro007-c1,qrr.%--,12a+,,or is it - most of them longer or ?==
778.743,778.913,Bro007-c3,fg,,,yeah .
778.913,782.453,Bro007-c3,s,12b.13a,,for the italian even seven digits y- - more or less .
778.931,779.541,Bro007-c2,b,,,yeah .
780.381,781.621,Bro007-c2,%-,,,it - it d- ==
782.453,786.373,Bro007-c3,s^rt,12b+,,but sometime the sentence have only one digit .
782.618,783.358,Bro007-c2,s^r,13b,,seven digits .
786.683,793.603,Bro007-c3,s,12b++,,and sometime uh - like uh - the number of uh - credit cards something like that .
793.145,793.855,Bro007-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
795.777,796.967,Bro007-c1,fh|qy^bu^d^rt,,,right | so between one and sixteen ?
796.967,802.667,Bro007-c1,s^df,,,see the - i mean - the reason i'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and i don't know how seriously to take them .
798.623,799.573,Bro007-c2,b^rt,,,mm-hmm ?
802.667,802.927,Bro007-c1,qy^d^g^rt,14a,,right ?
803.057,803.457,Bro007-c1,fh,,,so ==
804.011,804.711,Bro007-c2,s^aa,14b,,yeah .
804.287,818.975,Bro007-c1,fh|s,,,uh - | if you had uh - just you know to give an example if you had uh - um - if you had a thousand words then uh - a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word .
818.975,819.295,Bro007-c1,qy^d^g^rt,,,right ?
