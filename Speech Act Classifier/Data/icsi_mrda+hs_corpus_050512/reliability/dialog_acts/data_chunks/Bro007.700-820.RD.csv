698.281,702.981,Bro007-c1,s^cs,5a,,and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .
704.117,707.307,Bro007-c2,s,5b.6a,,yeah it's - it's significantly worse well but - mm-hmm .
707.957,709.907,Bro007-c1,s^na,6b,,it's significantly worse .
709.907,716.47,Bro007-c1,s^na,6b+,,it's - it's uh - it's - it's mostly worse .
710.705,714.355,Bro007-c2,s|fh,5b+,,exc- - except for the h_m | but .
713.368,715.248,Bro007-c3,s,,,for many a mismatch it's worse .
717.19,717.54,Bro007-c1,b,,,yeah .
718.725,719.505,Bro007-c1,s,,,but it is little .
719.765,721.895,Bro007-c1,s^df,,,i mean not - not by a huge amount .
721.895,722.455,Bro007-c1,s^no,,,i don't know .
723.692,726.382,Bro007-c1,qw,7a,,what are - what are the sizes of any of these sets ?
726.382,729.082,Bro007-c1,s,7a+,,i - i'm - i'm sure you told me before but i've forgotten .
729.942,737.431,Bro007-c1,qw,7a++,,so - you know how many words are in uh - one of these test sets ?
730.045,730.425,Bro007-c2,h,,,uh ==
737.491,738.211,Bro007-c3,s^no,7b-1,,i don't remember .
739.091,747.919,Bro007-c2,h|s,7b-2,,um - | it's - it depends - well - the well matched is generally larger than the other sets .
739.555,740.065,Bro007-c1,qy^d,7a+++,,about ?
749.2,756.065,Bro007-c2,s,,,and i think it's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps at least .
752.157,752.777,Bro007-c3,%-,,,ye- ==
754.922,758.952,Bro007-c3,s,,,but words - well word - i don't know .
756.845,757.025,Bro007-c2,qo^d,,,hmm ?
759.315,759.985,Bro007-c2,s,,,the words yeah .
759.542,760.262,Bro007-c3,s,8a,,sentences .
759.985,761.915,Bro007-c2,s^m,8b,,s- - sentences .
762.345,765.255,Bro007-c2,s|fh,8b+.9a,,some sets have five hundred sentences | so .
764.991,765.291,Bro007-c3,s^bk,9b,,yeah .
766.53,767.17,Bro007-c2,b,,,mmm .
766.718,771.678,Bro007-c1,s,,,so the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences let's say .
772.048,775.448,Bro007-c1,qy^d^rt,10a,,and each sentence on the average has four or five digits ?
775.448,777.268,Bro007-c1,qrr.%--,10a+,,or is it - most of them longer or ?==
778.743,778.913,Bro007-c3,s^aa,10b-1.11a,,yeah .
778.913,782.453,Bro007-c3,s^na,10b-1+.11a+,,for the italian even seven digits y- - more or less .
778.931,779.541,Bro007-c2,s^aa,10b-2,,yeah .
780.381,781.621,Bro007-c2,%-,,,it - it d- ==
782.453,786.373,Bro007-c3,s^arp^rt,10b-1++.11a++,,but sometime the sentence have only one digit .
782.618,783.358,Bro007-c2,s,,,seven digits .
786.683,793.603,Bro007-c3,s,10b-1+++.11a+++,,and sometime uh - like uh - the number of uh - credit cards something like that .
793.145,793.855,Bro007-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
795.777,796.967,Bro007-c1,s^bk|s^bu,11b,,right | so between one and sixteen .
796.967,802.927,Bro007-c1,s^df|qy^d^g,,,see the - i mean - the reason i'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and i don't know how seriously to take them | right ?
798.623,799.573,Bro007-c2,x,,,mm-hmm ?
803.057,819.295,Bro007-c1,fh|s^bu|qy^d^g,,,so uh - | i- - if - if you had uh - just you know to give an example if you had uh - um - if you had a thousand words then uh - a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word | right ?
804.011,804.711,Bro007-c2,b,,,yeah .
