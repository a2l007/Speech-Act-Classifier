698.281,702.981,Bro007-c1,s^cs,1a,,and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .
704.117,706.467,Bro007-c2,s,1b.2a,,yeah it's - it's significantly worse well but .
707.167,707.307,Bro007-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
707.957,709.907,Bro007-c1,s^br^h^m,2b,,it's significantly worse .
709.907,716.47,Bro007-c1,s,3b,,it's - it's uh - it's - it's mostly worse .
710.705,714.355,Bro007-c2,s.%-,,,exc- - except for the h_m but ==
713.368,715.248,Bro007-c3,s,3a,,for many a mismatch it's worse .
717.19,717.54,Bro007-c1,b,,,yeah .
718.725,719.505,Bro007-c1,sj^ba,,,but it is little .
719.765,721.895,Bro007-c1,sj^ba^e,,,i mean not - not by a huge amount .
721.895,722.455,Bro007-c1,s^no,,,i don't know .
723.692,726.382,Bro007-c1,qw^rt,,,what are - what are the sizes of any of these sets ?
726.382,729.082,Bro007-c1,s^df,,,i - i'm - i'm sure you told me before but i've forgotten .
729.942,737.431,Bro007-c1,qw,4a,,so - you know how many words are in uh - one of these test sets ?
730.045,747.919,Bro007-c2,h|s^rt,6b,,uh - um - | it's - it depends - well - the well matched is generally larger than the other sets .
737.491,738.211,Bro007-c3,s^no,4b.5a,,i don't remember .
739.555,740.065,Bro007-c1,qw^g,5b.6a,,about ?
749.2,756.065,Bro007-c2,s,6b+.7a,,and i think it's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps at least .
752.157,752.777,Bro007-c3,%-,,,ye- ==
754.922,756.092,Bro007-c3,qy^rt,7b.8a,,but words ?
756.845,757.025,Bro007-c2,qw^rt,8b.9a,,hmm ?
757.602,757.942,Bro007-c3,qy^r^rt,9b.10a,,well word ?
758.432,758.952,Bro007-c3,s^no,,,i don't know .
759.315,759.985,Bro007-c2,s^aa,10b,,the words yeah .
759.542,760.262,Bro007-c3,s^bc,1a,,sentences .
759.985,761.915,Bro007-c2,s^bk^m,1b,,s- - sentences .
762.345,765.255,Bro007-c2,s|fh,2a,,some sets have five hundred sentences | so .
764.991,765.291,Bro007-c3,s^aa,2b,,yeah .
766.53,767.17,Bro007-c2,b,,,mmm .
766.718,771.678,Bro007-c1,s^rt,,,so the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences let's say .
772.048,777.268,Bro007-c1,qr^d,3a,,and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it - most of them longer or ?
778.743,782.453,Bro007-c3,s^aa|s,3b.4a,,yeah | for the italian even seven digits y- - more or less .
778.931,779.541,Bro007-c2,h,,,yeah .
780.381,781.621,Bro007-c2,s.%-,,,it - it d- ==
782.453,786.373,Bro007-c3,s^rt,3b+.4a+,,but sometime the sentence have only one digit .
782.618,783.358,Bro007-c2,s,,,seven digits .
786.683,793.603,Bro007-c3,s,3b++.4a++,,and sometime uh - like uh - the number of uh - credit cards something like that .
793.145,793.855,Bro007-c1,b,,,mm-hmm .
795.777,796.967,Bro007-c1,s^bk|s,4b,,right | so between one and sixteen .
796.967,802.667,Bro007-c1,s,5a,,see the - i mean - the reason i'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and i don't know how seriously to take them .
798.623,799.573,Bro007-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
802.667,802.927,Bro007-c1,qy^d^f^g^rt,5a+,,right ?
803.057,818.975,Bro007-c1,fh|s,6a,,so uh - | i- - if - if you had uh - just you know to give an example if you had uh - um - if you had a thousand words then uh - a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word .
804.011,804.711,Bro007-c2,s^bk,5b,,yeah .
818.975,819.295,Bro007-c1,qy^d^f^g^rt,6a+,,right ?
