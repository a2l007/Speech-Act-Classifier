2401.9,2405.69,Bed015-c5,s,,,um and i left the slot predications open .
2406.09,2410.47,Bed015-c5,s^df,,,because you can have um things like the guy i know from school .
2410.47,2417.65,Bed015-c5,s,,,or you know like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na- - amounts of prep- - you know predications that you might make .
2410.48,2411.02,Bed015-c4,b,,,mm-hmm .
2418.11,2420.96,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,and it's unclear whether ==
2420.96,2425.37,Bed015-c5,s|qy^d^f^g,,,i mean you could just have in your scenario here are some extra few things that are true | right ?
2425.61,2426.02,Bed015-c4,b,,,mm-hmm .
2425.82,2428.78,Bed015-c5,s|qy^d^f^g,,,and then you could just sort of not have this slot here | right ?
2428.78,2431.84,Bed015-c5,s,1a,,you're - but - but it's used for identification purposes .
2431.84,2436.22,Bed015-c5,s,2a,,so it's - it's a little bit different from just saying all these things are true from my utterance .
2431.85,2432.13,Bed015-c4,s^aa,1b-1,,yeah .
2431.94,2432.29,Bed015-c2,s^aa,1b-2,,right .
2435.96,2436.2,Bed015-c4,b,,,yeah .
2437.23,2437.63,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2437.91,2444.95,Bed015-c4,fg|s:s,2b.3a,,right | this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school .
2444.95,2446.2,Bed015-c4,s:s,2b+.3a+,,and he came over for dinner .
2446.2,2448.03,Bed015-c4,s,2b++.3a++,,that's not the same effect .
2447.3,2449.01,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,3b,,yeah | it's a little bit - it's a little bit different .
2449.01,2449.53,Bed015-c5,s^f|%--,,,right | so ==
2450.01,2452.06,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,or maybe that's like a restrictive non-restrictive ==
2452.06,2454.51,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for ==
2452.47,2452.75,Bed015-c4,b,,,yeah .
2455.05,2461.32,Bed015-c5,s,,,um but maybe i'm mixing you know - this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .
2461.32,2468.83,Bed015-c5,s,,,so you might imagine that the information you pass to you know - in identifying a particular referent would be oh some - you know it's a guy .
2461.33,2461.69,Bed015-c4,b,,,mm-hmm .
2468.83,2469.94,Bed015-c5,s,,,and it's someone i know from school .
2469.94,2480.07,Bed015-c5,s,,,so maybe that would you know be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc- - to the whatever construal engine or whatever discourse context to find - you know either create this reference .
2470.11,2470.29,Bed015-c4,b,,,yeah .
2480.07,2481.36,Bed015-c5,s,,,in which case it'd be created here .
2480.28,2481,Bed015-c4,b,,,mm-hmm .
2481.36,2481.53,Bed015-c5,fh,,,and ==
2482.02,2483.91,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,you know so - so you could imagine that this might not ==
2483.97,2487.59,Bed015-c5,s,,,so uh i'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .
2487.42,2491.59,Bed015-c0,s,4a,,but - to make it m- - precise at least in my mind uh it's not precise .
2487.6,2488.32,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2491.97,2494.96,Bed015-c0,qw^rt,4a+,,so house is gender neuter ?
2496.77,2498.2,Bed015-c5,h|s.%-,4b=1,,um | it could be in ==
2497.26,2498.15,Bed015-c0,qy^d^rt,4a+,,in reality ?
2498.59,2499.14,Bed015-c0,qrr.%-,,,or in ?==
2498.74,2499.45,Bed015-c2,s,4b-2.5a,,semantically .
2500.19,2502,Bed015-c5,s^m^na|s^aa,5b-1,,semantically yeah | yeah .
2500.43,2501.06,Bed015-c0,s^bk^m,5b-2,,semantically .
2501.57,2501.99,Bed015-c0,%-,,,so ==
2502.69,2504.61,Bed015-c5,s:s,,,so it uh uh a table .
2505.78,2508.15,Bed015-c5,s,,,you know a thing that c- - doesn't have a gender .
2508.15,2510.23,Bed015-c5,fg|s.%--,,,so | uh it could be that - i mean ==
2511.26,2513.01,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,maybe you'd - maybe not all these ==
2513.23,2518.96,Bed015-c5,s,6a,,i mean i wou- - i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most - most things .
2518.64,2525.13,Bed015-c0,s^ar|s,6b.7a,,no | just to make sure that we - everybody that's - completely agreed that it - it has nothing to do with uh form .
2520,2520.39,Bed015-c5,s^bk,7b,,yeah .
2521.6,2523.56,Bed015-c5,s^bk|s.%-,7b+,,o_k | that is semantic as opposed to ==
2524.14,2526.14,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,7b++,,yeah yeah | that's right .
2527.14,2527.68,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2531.15,2531.87,Bed015-c5,%-,,,s- - so again ==
2531.28,2537.31,Bed015-c0,s,8a,,then predications makes sense to - to have it open for something like uh accessibility or not .
2534.59,2535.94,Bed015-c5,s^2,8b,,open to various things .
2537.31,2537.37,Bed015-c0,b,,,yeah .
2538.1,2538.39,Bed015-c5,b,,,right .
2539.92,2541.4,Bed015-c5,s^bk|s,,,o_k | so let's see .
2541.4,2550.84,Bed015-c5,qy^rt^t^tc,9a,,so maybe having made that big sca- - sort of like large scale comment should i just go through each of these slots - uh each of these blocks um a little bit ?
2551.74,2552.02,Bed015-c4,s^aa,9b,,sure .
2552,2556.33,Bed015-c5,s,,,um mostly the top one is sort of image schematic .
2556.81,2558.85,Bed015-c5,s,,,and just a note .
2558.85,2559.78,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,which was that um ==
2560.18,2562.22,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,s- - so when we actually ha- ==
2562.22,2563.23,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,so for instance um ==
2564.29,2566.8,Bed015-c5,s|s^f,,,some of them seem more inherently static | o_k .
2566.8,2569.88,Bed015-c5,s,,,like a container or sort of support-ish .
2570.3,2573.69,Bed015-c5,s,,,and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic .
2573.93,2575.99,Bed015-c5,s,,,like source path goal is often thought of that way .
2576.33,2577.65,Bed015-c5,s,,,or force or something like that .
2577.97,2583,Bed015-c5,s,,,but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that .
2583,2586.91,Bed015-c5,s,,,and different x_schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic .
2587.11,2590.07,Bed015-c5,s,,,so path you could just be talking about the path between this and this .
2589.39,2589.83,Bed015-c4,b.%,,,mmm .
2590.07,2592.24,Bed015-c5,s,,,and you know container that you can go in and out .
2592.24,2592.72,Bed015-c5,s,,,all of these things .
2592.72,2594,Bed015-c5,fh,,,and so um ==
2594.81,2599.15,Bed015-c5,s,,,i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day .
2599.4,2600.96,Bed015-c5,s^bsc,,,the spaniettes as we called them .
2601.17,2607.57,Bed015-c5,s,,,um to decide like how you want to split up like s- - image schematic contributions versus like x_schematic contributions .
2607.57,2608.25,Bed015-c5,qh^e,,,how do you link them up ?
2608.52,2613.47,Bed015-c5,s,,,and i think again um it's gonna be something in the x_schema that tells you is this static or is this dynamic .
2613.47,2616.9,Bed015-c5,s^cs,10a,,so we definitely need - that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that .
2617.28,2623.42,Bed015-c5,fg|s,,,um | that you know is it uh a state or is it a change of state or is it a um action of some kind .
2624.03,2629.97,Bed015-c0,qy,10b.11a,,uh i- - i- - i- - is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?
2624.29,2624.32,Bed015-c5,fh,,,uh ==
2624.68,2624.82,Bed015-c5,s^bk,11b,,yeah .
2630.81,2631.2,Bed015-c0,%-,,,just means ==
2630.93,2632.34,Bed015-c5,s^bk|qy^bu^d,11b+.12a,,oh oh | you mean in the slot ?
2632.69,2632.96,Bed015-c0,s^aa,12b,,mm-hmm .
2632.73,2636.13,Bed015-c5,s^ar|s,,,um no | it's like x_sc- - it's - it's like i was thinking of type constraints .
2636.13,2637.93,Bed015-c5,s,13a,,but x_schema well it obviously has to be an x_schema .
2638.35,2641.19,Bed015-c5,s,13a+,,agent i mean the - the performer of the x_schema .
2641.19,2642.23,Bed015-c5,s,13a++,,that s- - depends on the x_schema .
2642.23,2644.57,Bed015-c5,s.%-,13a+++,,you know and i - in general it would probably be you know ==
2644.46,2648.1,Bed015-c4,s^bu,13b.14a,,so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .
2646.9,2648.4,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,14b.15a,,yeah | basically .
2648.41,2648.82,Bed015-c0,b,,,mm-hmm .
2648.52,2648.81,Bed015-c4,s^bk,15b,,o_k .
2648.73,2650.31,Bed015-c5,s^bd,,,um aspectual type probably isn't obvious .
2650.31,2654.7,Bed015-c5,s^df.%-,,,but i should have - so i just neglected to stick something in perspective actor undergoer observer um ==
2651.82,2652.53,Bed015-c1,b,,,mmm .
2655.44,2657.72,Bed015-c5,s.%-,16a,,i think we've often used agent patient obser- ==
2656.51,2656.91,Bed015-c4,s^fe,16b.17a,,whee !
2657.36,2658.22,Bed015-c4,s^bu|qy^d^g,16b+.17a+,,that's that one | right ?
2657.72,2660.2,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,17b,,yeah | exactly exactly .
2660.44,2675.62,Bed015-c5,fh|s,,,um | and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this example of like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch- - you know - definitely it is one way to - for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object .
2675.9,2680.05,Bed015-c5,qh,,,and so then we talked about you know whether well does that specify topic as well ?
2680.05,2681.14,Bed015-c5,s,,,well maybe there are other things .
2681.14,2683.51,Bed015-c5,s,,,you know now that it's - subject is more like a topic .
2683.51,2684.08,Bed015-c5,s.%--,18a,,and now that you know ==
2684.76,2685.22,Bed015-c5,fg|%--,18a+,,anyway | so ==
2685.29,2686.39,Bed015-c5,s^fa|s,18a++,,sorry | i'm gonna trail off on that one .
2686.39,2688.04,Bed015-c5,s^df,18a+++,,cuz it's not that f- - important right now .
2688.47,2688.91,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2688.66,2695.12,Bed015-c2,s,18b.19a,,n- - now for the moment we just need the ability to l- - l- - write it down if - if somebody figured out what the rules were .
2691.44,2692.03,Bed015-c5,s^2.%-,19b,,to know how ==
2694.25,2695.9,Bed015-c5,s^aa|s^na,19b+.20a,,yeah yeah | exactly .
2695.3,2695.45,Bed015-c2,s^bk,20b,,yeah .
2696.15,2696.75,Bed015-c5,fh,,,um ==
2697.62,2698.53,Bed015-c5,s.%--,,,some of these other ones ==
2698.53,2698.85,Bed015-c5,s,,,let's see .
2698.85,2699.27,Bed015-c5,fh,,,so ==
2700.22,2703,Bed015-c5,s,,,uh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts .
2703,2707.61,Bed015-c5,s,,,so polarity uh is using for like action did not take place for instance .
2703.18,2703.61,Bed015-c2,b,,,mm-hmm .
