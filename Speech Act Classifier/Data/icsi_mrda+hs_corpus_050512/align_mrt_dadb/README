The .mpf (merged punctuation format) files contain information on the
punctuations given by both the MRT and the DADB files.  Each file contains
all the words (except digits task words) for each channel of each meeting in
the 75 meetings in the ICSI Meeting Recorder 1.0 release.

In each file, the following header exists

                SEGMENT PUNCTUATION
           WORD   MRT   MRT  DADB  
-----------------------------------

followed by a line for each MRT word that contains the following columns

<MRT Word>         : found in the MRT files
<MRT Segment>      : 0 when there is no segment boundary after the word
                     # when there is a segment boundary after the word
<MRT Punctuation>  : . ? ! - , or a combination
<DADB Punctuation> : . ? ! - | == ?== or a combination

Here is an example

                SEGMENT PUNCTUATION
           WORD   MRT   MRT  DADB  
-----------------------------------
            O_K     0     .     .
             So     0     0     0
             uh     0     ,     -
           he's     0     0     0
            not     0     0     0
           here     0     ,     .
             so     0     0     0
            you     0     0     0
            get     0     0     0
             to     #     -    ==
           Yeah     #     .     .
         Mm-hmm     #     .     .

Several notes:
-There are 0 or more leading spaces for each line, depending on the length of
 the MRT word.
-Occassionally, several punctuations exist after a word.  These are preserved
 in this file.  Multiple MRT punctuations have no space between them, but
 multiple DADB punctuations have a space between them.
-Quotation marks are not included in the mpf files.
-As noted in the introduction paragraph of this document, MRT segments marked
 with the "DigitTask=true" attribute are not included.
