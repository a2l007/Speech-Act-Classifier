              I     0     0     0

          you'd     0     0     0
           need     0     0     0

       separate     0     0     0
            set     0     0     0
             up     0     0     .
            and     0     0     0
            the     0     0     0
     assumption     0     0     0
           that     0     0     0
            you     0     0     0
          could     0     0     0
           time     0     0     0
          align     0     0     0

           much     0     0     0
        worried     0     0     0

              I     0     0     0

            the     0     0     0
           real     0     0     0
          issue     0     0     0
             is     #     0     0
           that     0     ,     0
             uh     0     ,     0
          there     0     0     0
             is     0     0     0
             no     0     0     0
            way     0     0     0

             So     0     0     0
            you     0     0     0
          would     0     0     0
