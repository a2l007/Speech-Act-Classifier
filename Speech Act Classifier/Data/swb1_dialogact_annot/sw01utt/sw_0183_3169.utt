o          A.1 utt1:   Is, {F uh, } kind of fun. - /
sv          A.1 utt2: It's best done when you have leisure time  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C and } I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now <breathing>.  /
sd          A.1 utt4: {C And } I grew up in an area that, {F uh, } was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake  /
sd          A.1 utt5: {C and } we had <noise> a variety of boats at our disposal <breathing>.  {F Uh, }  /
sd          A.1 utt6:  I worked for a camp for a number of years.  /
sd          A.1 utt7: My father was on staff there,  /
sd          A.1 utt8: {C and } we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats,  /
sd          A.1 utt9: you name it,  they had it  /
sd          A.1 utt10: {C and } we did a lot of [ watering, + <breathing>, water sports. ]  /
sd          A.1 utt11: {C But } I think, {F uh, } <breathing> the thing I liked the best was, {F uh, } we spent about a summer <lipsmack> - /
sd          A.1 utt12: couple of guys, {F uh, } restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real [ h-, +  big ] old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves,  /
sd          A.1 utt13: {C or } the wind came from the side  /
sd          A.1 utt14: {C and } we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it.  /
sd          A.1 utt15:  If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up.  /
sd          A.1 utt16: It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, {F uh, } upright again.  /
sd          A.1 utt17:  This one you had to work with.  /
sd          A.1 utt18:  You <laughter> get out of the water again and get it upright.  /
sd          A.1 utt19: {C And, }  {F uh, } sailing [ was, +  was ]  kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against [ the, +  the ] wind, as it were, tacking back and forth  /
sd          A.1 utt20: {C and, } {F uh, } more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day  /
sd          A.1 utt21: {C and, } {F uh, } the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing  /
sd@          A.1 utt22: {C and } as soon as the front came over, it was calm.  So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle <breathing>  /  *[[ Seems that a new slash unit should start with "So . . ." ]]
sd          A.1 utt23: {C and } you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away.  /
sd          A.1 utt24: {C And } that didn't always work.  /
sd          A.1 utt25:  We oftentimes got wet, <breathing>.  /
sd          A.1 utt26: {C But, }  {F uh, } [ it's, +  it's ] a [ nice, +  nice ] hobby to have.  /
sd          A.1 utt27:   Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore,  /
sv          A.1 utt28: {D so } things change, I guess.  /
qw          A.1 utt29:  What are your memories of boating,  /
qrr          A.1 utt30: {C or } current, -/  

sd          B.2 utt1:   {F Uh, } about the only memories that I have of boating, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.2 utt2: my husband's family had [ a, + a ] motor boat, {F uh, }  when we got engaged  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C and } they took us out on the lake several times.   /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C And, }  {F uh, } I really did enjoy that.  /
sd          B.2 utt5:  [ I, +  I ] don't know that I ever learned to drive it or  anything,  /
sd          B.2 utt6: {C but, }  {F uh, } we did some water skiing, of course,  [ and, +  and, ]  {F uh, } driving around the lake in the boat [ and, +  and ] just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting.  {F Uh, } {D you know, }  /
sd          B.2 utt7: [ they, +  they ]  just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever.  /
sd          B.2 utt8: [ The, +  the ] laws were there  /
sd          B.2 utt9:  {C and } if you didn't obey them, {F uh } --   

b          A.3 utt1:   Right. /  

+          B.4 utt1:   -- {D you know, } <laughter> there were a lot of accidents,  I   guess. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:   That's true. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:   {C But, }  {F uh, } I found the motor boating was real fun. /  

b          A.7 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: I remember learning how to ski, {F oh, }  /
sd          A.7 utt3: I guess I was seven or eight years old  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C and } the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C and } it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres  /
sd          A.7 utt6: {C and } [ it was, +  {F uh } <breathing>, it had ]  a lot of, {F uh, } turtles in it.  /
sd          A.7 utt7: {C And } I got all ready to go  /
sd          A.7 utt8:  {C and } I was down in the water [ and, +   and ] set to go  /
sd          A.7 utt9: [ {C and, } +   {F uh, } {C and } ]  just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back. /  

b          B.8 utt1:   Oh <breathing>. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:   It didn't hurt too much,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C but } it bit enough to where I let go.  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C And } the boat went off without me  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } I reached back there  and [ s-, + ] pushed him away and got out of the water [ a, +  a ] while  /
sd          A.9 utt5: [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } it didn't even leave a mark.  /
sd          A.9 utt6:  It was just a little nibble  /
sd          A.9 utt7: {C and so } I told everybody what happened  /
sd(^q)       A.9 utt8: {C and } they go, {F oh, }  yeah,  sure, {D you know. } /  

x          B.10 utt1:   <Laughter>.   

sd          A.11 utt1:   {C And so } I get back down in there  /
sd          A.11 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  I'll be if he didn't do it again.  /
sd          A.11 utt3:  This time a little earlier [ [ and, +  and ] + ] I had let go before then and, before they took off this time [ and, + and ] swatted him away.  /
sd          A.11 utt4: {C So } I moved over [ a, +  a ]  few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and,  {F uh, } managed to get up.  /
sd          A.11 utt5: Didn't go very  far,  /
sd          A.11 utt6: {C but } I got up.  /
sd          A.11 utt7:   {C And } [ it, +  it ] was a [ nice, + {F uh, } nice ] long skiing career,  /
sd          A.11 utt8:  {C but } now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me. /
sd          A.11 utt9:  [ I've, +  I've, ] {F uh, } done about all I dare do on skis.  {D You know, } skiing on one and jumping around here and there  /
sd          A.11 utt10: {C and }  [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ] know how you can get injured doing much more than that  /
sd          A.11 utt11: {C and } I just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that. /
sd          A.11 utt12: Just, {F uh, } can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager, I guess <breathing>.   /
sd          A.11 utt13: {D So } life just changes a little bit in that respect <breathing>.  /
sd          A.11 utt14: I'd kind of like, someday, to maybe end up on a pair of skis [ that, +  that ] doesn't have a, {F uh, }  {D well, } - /
sd          A.11 utt15:  what they call trick skis. - /
sd          A.11 utt16: They'll allow you to ski backwards.  /
sd          A.11 utt17:  I haven't [ cr-, +  managed ] to get a hold on that, {F uh, } craft yet,  /
%          A.11 utt18:  {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.12 utt1:   That sounds like a real challenge. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: [ it, +  it ] would be kind of nice.  /
sd          A.13 utt3: I hadn't quite figured out,  /
sd          A.13 utt4: I don't have anybody to teach me either.  /
sd          A.13 utt5: That's another little thing.  /
sd          A.13 utt6:  You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do,  /
sd          A.13 utt7: {C but, }  just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick <breathing>, {D you know. }  Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around. /  

b          B.14 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

h          A.15 utt1:   {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: maybe someday  [ I'll +  <lipsmack>, I'll ] get back to that [ as, +  after ] the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:   {D Well, } my son, -/
