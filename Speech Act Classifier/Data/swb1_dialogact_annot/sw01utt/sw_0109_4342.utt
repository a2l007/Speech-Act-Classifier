sd          B.70 utt1: {F Oh, } I would imagine [ [ in, + {F uh, } {D you know, } in, ] + in ] Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover, that it gets hard covering all of the [ sub-, + suburbs ]  /

sd        A.73 utt3: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] find that attitude kind of arrogant, though.  /
sd(^q)       A.73 utt4: It's like you're taking our money,  /
