ad          B.1 utt2: {D Well, } {F uh, } I'll let you start, I guess <sniffing>. /  

b          A.2 utt1: <Throat_clearing> {D Well, } {F uh, } yeah,  /
sd          A.2 utt2: [ I, + I'm ] employed by a company that does do, {F uh, } random drug testing  /
sd           A.2 utt3: {C and } I've got some <laughter> very definite, {F uh, } opinions about it.  {F Uh, } {D you know, } <sigh> which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions [ from, + from ] [ when they, + when they ] announced it. But, {F uh, } developed a little more, I guess, but haven't changed that much.  /  
qo          A.2 utt4: What about you?  /
qy          A.2 utt5: Are you, {F uh, } [ in-, + involved ] at all? /  

nn          @B.3 utt1: {F Uh, } no.  /
sd^e          @B.3 utt2: {E I mean, } I'm not,  /
sd          @B.3 utt3: my employer does not do that. {F Uh, } although, {F uh, } I had an ex-employer that, - /
sd          @B.3 utt4: {F uh, } the previous job I used to have, {F uh, } they, - /
sd          @B.3 utt5: [ after, + I guess a few years after ] I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test. /  

b          A.4 utt1:  Yes. /  

h          B.5 utt1: {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know.  /
sd          B.5 utt2: My feeling is that <sigh> certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb, {F uh, }  if should somebody be under the influence of drugs, [ I, + I'd ] be willing to support that.  /
sd          B.5 utt3: For example, {F uh, } <inhaling> {F uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } train engineers. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          B.9 utt2: {C and } <inhaling> I guess air traffic controllers.  I wouldn't want them to be <laughter> on drugs. And airplane pilots.  /
sd          B.9 utt3: {C But } [ where it's not necessary, + {F uh, } in that regard, where it's not an immediate threat ] to life and limb or property --   

b          A.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.11 utt1:  -- {F uh, } [ [ I, + I'd, ] + I ] would seriously  question it.  /

sv          A.12 utt6: [ it, + to me, no matter how much [ [ the, + th-, ] + our ] company claims it's ] not a constitutional issue. That, because this is, {F uh, } between a company and an employee [ it is not, + it is not ] a government,  /
sv          A.12 utt7: it's not,  /
sv          A.12 utt8: the Constitution doesn't apply.  /
sv          A.12 utt9: {C But } [ [ I + <sigh>, it, ] + it ] seems to me that it still should.  /
sd          A.12 utt10: [ [ I, + I, ] + our ] company's doing it because they're a, {F uh, } government contractor <lipsmack>.  /
sd          A.12 utt11: {F Uh, } {C and so } [ it's, + it's required for certain, ] + [ some form, + some form ] of drug program is required ] to get the government contracts  /

qy^d          B.13 utt1:  {C So } it's the government that's mandating  it to a certain extent?  <noise>. /

sv          A.14 utt6: first off [ we don't, + we don't ] have enough courage to, {F uh, } pick out the people [ that, + that ] have some sort of indication of possible drug usage, {F uh, } because that would offend them, {F uh, } [ if they, + if they ] weren't.  /
sv          A.14 utt7: {C So } we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and,
