qw          A.1 utt1:  (( Jimmy )) , {D so } how do you get most of your news? /  

sd          B.2 utt1: {D Well, } [ I kind of, + {F uh, } I ] watch the, {F uh, } national news every day, for one.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: I also read one or two papers a day  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C and } [ I'm a, + I'm pretty much a ] news junkie  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } I tune in to C N N a lot. /  

ba          A.3 utt1: {F Oh, } wow.  /
qw^d          A.3 utt2: {D So, } when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news is when? /  

sd          B.4 utt1: {F Uh, } every evening at six thirty, I believe,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: I watch the national news. /  

sd^r          A.5 utt1: {F Oh, } okay.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {D Well, } I would probably be a junkie or [ s-, + watch ] <laughter> C N N a lot,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C but } [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't, ] {F uh, } subscribe to cable --   

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.7 utt1: -- [ be-, + because ] of the poor service and also, {F uh, } because, - /
sd          A.7 utt2: {D well, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] give to the United Way  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C and so } I figured that amount of money I just donate to that. /  

b          B.8 utt1: Uh-huh,  /
bf          B.8 utt2: as opposed to paying for cable. /  

aa          A.9 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: I take away a, {F uh, } addiction <laughter>. /  

x          B.10 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

bf          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } something. /  

aa          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  {D Well } I, -/  

%          B.14 utt1: {F Uh, } overall [ I, + I, ] - /
sv          B.14 utt2: the quality of the news you get [ o-, + off ] of most, {F uh, } sources I would say is pretty low.  /
%          B.14 utt3: It's, - /
sv          B.14 utt4:  usually you get pretty incomplete coverage  /
sd          B.14 utt5: {C and } that's one of the reasons [ where I, + why I ] try and get as many sources as possible,  /
sv          B.14 utt6: {C because } if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture [ of, + of ] what is going on. You would hope,  /
sv          B.14 utt7: {C but } still, {D you know, } hard to say --   

b          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh. } /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- that what you've heard is what really is. /  

qw          A.17 utt1:  [ What, + what, ] {F uh, } newspapers do you read? /  

sd          B.18 utt1: {D Well, } I read, {F uh, } the local newspaper  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and } I also try and read one of the, {F uh, } major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that. /  

b          A.19 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.19 utt2: For a while there [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] {F uh, } subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, [ a-, + actually ] a couple of newspapers because, {F uh, } {D you know, } my fiance, - /
sd          A.19 utt3: {D well, } she was unemployed for a while  /
sd          A.19 utt4: {C so } she, {D you know, } really needed to look at [ the, + <inhaling> the ] [ want-, + help wanted ] ads -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.21 utt1: -- {C and } so often [ [ they, + they tr-, ] + the newspapers are ] trying to compete with a lot of other sources of [ newspape-, + {F uh, } news. ] /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

h          A.23 utt1: {C And, } I don't know,  /
sv          A.23 utt2: NEW YORK TIMES is okay,  /
sv          A.23 utt3: [ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] when you read a lot of this stuff, [ the, + the ] quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so,  /
sd          A.23 utt4: {C but } --   

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] say it's  like the sixth grade reading level,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C but } --   

b          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  -- I swear it's at least second or third grade,   

x          B.28 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.29 utt1:  sometimes. /  

bf          B.30 utt1:  Pretty low. /  

sd          A.31 utt1: <Throat_clearing> {C But, } I don't know,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {F uh, } I think if you listen to {D like } N P R or something like, -/  

aa          B.32 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: [ I, + I ] really like N P R a lot. /  

sv          A.33 utt1: That's pretty good.  /
sd          A.33 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } I like listening to that [ on, + on, ] {F uh, } - /
sd          A.33 utt3: when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time [ to, + to ] listen to it, because I, -/  

aa          B.34 utt1: Right,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: I [ miss + ] N P R a lot also.  /
sd          B.34 utt4: I really like them because they give, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.34 utt5: instead of being, as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which I think is good. /  

%          A.35 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

%          B.36 utt1: {C And } they also, - /
sv          B.36 utt2: their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing. /  

sd          A.37 utt1: {D Well, } McNeil <<mispronounced>>, [ Neil-, + ] and Lehrer, - /
sd          A.37 utt2: I guess he's leaving,  /
sd          A.37 utt3: one of them is leaving. /  

b          B.38 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1: {F Uh, } [ they're, + they're ] pretty good, too.  /
qy^g          A.39 utt2: {F Uh, } I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right? /  

na          B.40 utt1:  Right <laughter>  /
ny          B.40 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  Had that invasion or whatever it is. /  

aa          B.42 utt1:  Sure was. /  

h          A.43 utt1: {F Uh, } {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sv          A.43 utt2: I guess [ a lot of + it's still a lot of ] hype.  /
ad          A.43 utt3: Look at [ the, + the ] Smith trial. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  {E I mean, } that was a joke. /  

aa          B.46 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: that was, - /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C but } then you also have things [ where you, + {F uh, } where they ] broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was [ r-, + really ] good. /  

aa          A.47 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: the N P R doing that,  /
%          A.47 utt3: yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt4: I know,  /
sd          A.47 utt5: I had, {F uh, } some visitor  /
sd          A.47 utt6: {C and } he was [ just in-, + just, ] I don't know, fixated on that, {D you know, } just listened to it --   

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-uh. /  

+          A.49 utt1: -- constantly.  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } I guess that's good when it's live, [ if you, + if you'll ] really want that, /
sv          A.49 utt3: {C but } that's not really providing you news. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.51 utt1:  [ It's, + it's ] more like a media event rather than --   

sv          B.52 utt1:  {D Well, } [ {C but } the -- +   

+          A.53 utt1:  -- reporting. /  

+          B.54 utt1: -- {C but } the ] [ [ ne-, + news, ] + news ] that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which [ I, + I ] tune into every once in a while. /  

bh          A.55 utt1:  {F Oh, } really?  /
sd          A.55 utt2:  That's kind of boring to me, I think. /  

aa          B.56 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt2: [ it, + it ] is, really kind of boring,  /
%          B.56 utt3: {C but, } {D you know, } that's, - /
sv           B.56 utt4: [ if, + if ] you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned, {F uh, } report, somebody else's view about it  /
sv          B.56 utt5: {C and } that's what [ you're supposed, + you're supposed ] to, - /
sv          B.56 utt6: if you watch the news, [ you're going, + your opinion is going ] to be formed [ about, + ] on what somebody else thought about it --   

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.58 utt1: -- as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own [ pinion, + opinion, ] which I [ haven't, + would ] be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's. /  

aa          A.59 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.59 utt2: I guess that's true.  /
sd          A.59 utt3: {C But, } one of the ways that I get information is, {F uh, } every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to [ this, + this ] thing,  /
sd          A.59 utt4: it's free inside the company,  /
sd          A.59 utt5: it's called INTELLECT  /
sd          A.59 utt6: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they basically, {F uh, } type out abstracts which are really literally, - /
sd          A.59 utt7: [ I've, + I've ] actually read the actual articles,  /
sd          A.59 utt8: they're pretty g-, -/
