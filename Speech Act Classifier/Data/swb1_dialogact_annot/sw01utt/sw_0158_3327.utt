sd          B.42 utt2:  [ [ I, + I  did a lot of things that I, ] + I did everything that I ] could think to do. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {C And, }  eventually I brought it up to [ a, + a  ] place called Just Brakes -- /

sd          B.46 utt1:  -- {C and } it turns out that there's a, - /

sd          B.46 utt3: [ there's a, + there's  ]    disc brakes  /
sd          B.46 utt4: {C and } the parking brake is a piston deal. /  

%          A.47 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {C And } because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up. /  

%          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh. } /  

sd          B.50 utt1: {D So } they ended up having to pound it out.   /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C And } one of them, they,   

x          A.51 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          B.52 utt1:  were able to get running, {F uh, } kind of oiling it and playing with it  /
sd          B.52 utt2: {C and } the other one [ they just, + it was just ] frozen solid,  /
sd          B.52 utt3: {C so } I ended up having to buy one  /
sd          B.52 utt4: {C and } [ altog-, + all total, ] it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or  not, to get all that done <laughter>. /

h          B.60 utt6: <throat_clearing> [ {D a-, } + {D actually, } ] I'd say this.   /
sd          B.60 utt7: [ I, + I've ] gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore.  Only because, -/  

^2          A.61 utt1:  Disposal is a problem. /  

aap          B.62 utt1:  {D Well, } that is one problem,  /
