sd          B.18 utt4:  my electrical system shorted out {D like } two or three times,  /
sd          B.18 utt5: {C and } it's been torn up since April,  /
sd          B.18 utt6:  [ {C and } +  [ I, + ] {C and } ] luckily, everything was under warranty,  /
sd          B.18 utt7: {C so } it's only costing  {D like } a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed.  /
sd          B.18 utt8:  It would have been {D like } two thousand <laughter>. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  {D Well, } [ we've always, + {F uh, } we've always ]  had Oldsmobiles, and, {F uh, } been very, {F uh, } happy with Oldsmobiles,  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  {C but, }  {F uh, } my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C and then } she kind of changed her mind  and thinks her next car ought to be one of those, {F uh, } Mitsubishi Eclipses.  /

sd          B.22 utt1:  {F Um, } the gas mileage for one thing,  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  {C and } [ [ I've, +  I've, ] +  I've ] always had {D like } stick shift.  /
sd          B.22 utt3: [ I want to, + the next car I get I want it to ] be automatic. /

sd          B.24 utt1:  [ [ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] +  I ]  hate driving anyway,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: [ {C and } then, +  {C and } ] changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.25 utt2: especially when you're in high traffic areas --   

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  -- and have to mess with that all the time. -/  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } when you work  nine to five, or eight to five, and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work, unfortunately. /  

bf          A.29 utt1:  That makes it very frustrating. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } I look, - /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C and } one of the  things with Chrysler right now [ is, +  is ] [ their, +  the ] warranties that they have,  /
%          B.30 utt3: {C and } [ I, +  I ]  feel like their, - /
sd          B.30 utt4: everybody I've talked to that owns one, [ [ has, +  has, ] +  has ]  been real pleased with it,  /
sd          B.30 utt5: {C and } I like [ the, +  the ] driver's air bag,  /
sd          B.30 utt6: I like that. /  

qy^d          A.31 utt1:  Now this is a LeBaron? /  

ny          B.32 utt1:  {F Uh, } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.32 utt2: {D well } all Chrysler  products has it in there,  /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C but } LeBaron would be the next car I get,  /
%          B.32 utt4: yeah. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  I sure like [ the, +  {F uh, } [ convertible, + ]  those ] rag top LeBarons,  /
sv          A.33 utt2: they really look sporty. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: [ I like, +  I like ]  that too, {F huh, }  /
sd          B.34 utt4: {C but, }  {F uh, }  [ I, +  I ] couldn't afford the insurance on one of those <laughter>. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  <Laughter> {D Well, } {F uh, } we always, - /
sd          A.35 utt2:  this last Oldsmobile we bought, {F uh, } it's an eighty-seven,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C but } we bought it in eighty-eight,  {D you know, } right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ we found that, +   {F uh, } we found ] a real good interest rate,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {D you know, } when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like  that, they really come down on their prices  /
sd          A.37 utt3:  {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we looked around at used cars,  /
sd          A.37 utt4: {C and } we really couldn't,  {F uh, } afford the payments on a used car,  /
sd          A.37 utt5: {C because, } {F uh, } if you go to the bank and try to get a loan, they want to charge twelve, thirteen percent, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.37 utt6:  {C and } we ended up, I think, with {D like }  a four and a half percent interest rate on a  brand new car, and the payments. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } that's what I'm paying on mine now.  /
sd          B.38 utt2:  I had to get {D like } a first time, - /
sd          B.38 utt3:  my dad's always cosigned [ on, +  on ] [ my, +  my ]  loans, or whatever,  /
sd          B.38 utt4: {C and } this is one, when I bought,  /
sd          B.38 utt5: I got my Mustang this time [ was + ]  by myself, because I got on my own, or whatever,  /
sd          B.38 utt6: {C and, }  {F um, } I had said, - /
sd          B.38 utt7:   [ they, +  they ] said it had to be {D like } a first time buyer's car or whatever,  /
sd          B.38 utt8:  {C and } they're charging me unreasonable  ((   )) interest,  /
sd          B.38 utt9: {C but } <inhaling> I've got  eight more payments  /
sd          B.38 utt10: {C and } it's paid for. /  

ba          A.39 utt1:  {D Well, } that's great. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {C But } [ I got it when, + I got it when ]  the eighty-eights first came out,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: [ [ it's a, +  it's, ] +  it's a ] good car, {E I mean, }   I got in eighty-seven, I guess, in {D like } November or something like that,  /
%          B.40 utt3: {C and. } -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {D Well, } when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door.  /
sd          A.41 utt3:  Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven.  /
sd          A.41 utt4:   It was a two door Cutlass Supreme,  /
sd          A.41 utt5: {C and, }  {F uh, } it just happened  that when we looked for [ our, +  our ] new car, they had a thing going with Oldsmobile  /
sd          A.41 utt6:  {C and } if you'd buy [ a, +  a ] new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate,  because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.43 utt1:  I belie-,  /
b          A.43 utt2: yeah  /
sd^r          A.43 utt3: seventy-fifth anniversary.  /
sd          A.43 utt4: {C So  } in addition to everything else we got off the car,   all we had to do is show them our, {F uh, } papers on our first car,  /
sd          A.43 utt5: {C and } they gave us another four  hundred dollars off on it.  /
sd          A.43 utt6: {C So } [ we, +  we ] got a four door this time,  /
sd          A.43 utt7:  {C and } I sort of went more for [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] comfort factor,  /
sd          A.43 utt8: {C and, }  {F uh, } I liked the smaller cars,  /
sd          A.43 utt9:  {C but } I'm a bigger person,  /
sd          A.43 utt10: {C and } [ I, +  I ] really like comfort, {D you know, } driving along the road and stuff. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } that's another big factor of mine.  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  [ Next, +  next ] car I get's going to be a four door too.  Something with some room. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C Because } [ I, +  {F uh, } my ] Mustang  [ [ is, +  is, ] +  is ] two door with bucket seats,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C and } you buy groceries and stuff like that. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {C And } if you try to take anybody, {D you know, } go to the show or go out for supper, and you go as a foursome, -/
