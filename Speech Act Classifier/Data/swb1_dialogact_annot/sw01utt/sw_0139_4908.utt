sd          A.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } around here we have a program where,  {F uh, }  [ [ we, + we put out [ the, +  the, ] + we separate the ] bottles and the cans  and the plastic stuff from the newspapers.  /
sd          A.2 utt2: {C And } we keep the newspapers [ in a, + in a, ] - /
sd          A.2 utt3:  they're collected twice a month  and the trash [ and, + and ] this bottled stuff  that is put [ in a, + in a ] little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck.  /

bf          B.5 utt1:  {C But } I gather  you do not separate,  {F uh, } the bottles and cans. /

sd          B.11 utt3:  Not only have I come  to Washington but, {F uh, } I find it very amusing that, {F uh, } the thing that was  just instituted here is very similar.  /
sd          B.11 utt4: That is we also have blue bins.  /
sd          B.11 utt5:   We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and  gets separated in the truck and, {F uh, } landfill space is, in deed,   the driving factor here.  /
sd          B.11 utt6:  {C And, }  in fact, {F uh, } despite all of our open space out here, landfill space is still, {F uh, } very hard to come by. /

sd         B.21 utt1:  {F Um, } in fact, Los Alamos, {F uh, }  has, {F uh, } done a fair amount of research, {F uh, } in recycling things in general.  /
sd          B.21 utt2: {F Um, } [ it, + it ]  involves, for instance, {F uh, } creating biological organisms which can remove  heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, {F uh, } other things from,  {F uh, } waste material in general. [ And, + {F uh, } and ] purify the waste of specific,  {F uh, } {F uh, } nasty elements. /  

sv          A.22 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ isn't that a, + that's a, ] +  that's ] pretty, {F uh, } upscale, {F uh, } trash, {F uh, } {F uh, } situation.  /

+          B.27 utt1:  -- the thing that just was in the local  news bulletin was, <sniffing> somebody [ [ has, + {F uh, } ter-, ] + made ]  some special, {F uh, } polymers that have the ability to, {F uh, } make certain actinide elements adhere to them. /
sd          B.27 utt2:   {F Uh, } {F uh, } they've, {F uh, } looked at, {F uh, } plutonium and uranium  and, {F uh, } some other similar things # to # --

+          B.29 utt1:  -- try to remove those from radio active waste  /
sd          B.29 utt2:  {C and, }  again, this is driven by all of the documentation and, {F uh, } E S  and H, {F uh, } {F uh, } considerations that, {F uh, } people are, {F uh, } worrying about,  I  think, much more than they should.  /
sd          B.29 utt3: # {D Actually } # --

+          B.31 utt1:  -- I've been involved in recycling  for long before it became fashionable.  /
sd          B.31 utt2: Back when I was in graduate school,  I did all of the recycling of the, {F uh, } paper from the computer center  /
sd          B.31 utt3:  {C and, }  {F uh, } in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on  [ recyclable pa-, + recycled paper. ] /  

%          A.32 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

x          B.33 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.34 utt1:  {D Well } that's certainly, {F uh, }  {D you know, } {F uh, } getting into the swim of things.  /
sv(^q)        A.34 utt2: [ I, + I ] think [ it should be, + [ i-, + it ] should go ]  [ to the, + to the ] heart of the matter though  and say, okay guy,  /
^q          A.34 utt3: [ [ you, + y-, ] +  everybody ] gets, {D you know, } five pounds of garbage that they can throw away, {D you know. }  /
^q          A.34 utt4:   {F Uh, } {C but } more than that every week, {F uh, } you've got to pay by the pound. #  /

sv          B.35 utt1:  # I think that's # a wonderful idea. /  

+          A.36 utt1:  -- I think ]  [ people [ would be, +  would get ]  [ very, + very, ] + {D you know, } they'd be  very ] careful about how they bought stuff. /  

sv          B.37 utt1:  The only alternative I would see is, {F uh, }   {A and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's  garbage would be a real pain. }  {F Uh, } if you did it by volume rather than by weight --   

b          A.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.39 utt1:  -- it would, {F uh, } speak more  directly to the space needs and the landfill  /

b          A.40 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.41 utt1:  -- also cause people to compact their garbage more. /  

b          A.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.43 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]  limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight. /  

sv          A.44 utt1:  {D Well, } of course,  [ that, + {F uh, } {D you know, } those ] big trucks  [ [ can, + can, ] + probably are ] far more efficient in packing  than any kind of little household compactor. /
