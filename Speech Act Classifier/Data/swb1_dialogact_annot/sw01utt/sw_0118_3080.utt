ny          @B.2 utt2: yes,  /
sd^e          @B.2 utt3: [ I, + {F uh, } {F uh, } I ]  guess it actually changes,  /
sd          @B.2 utt4: I do a number of different things --    

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- simply walking with my wife -- /

sd          B.10 utt2: not every morning,  it probably averages about two days a week -- /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  -- {C and then } with my wife I actually  go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C but } it's along the lines, /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Right. /  

qo          B.14 utt1:  How about yourself. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } that's a hard  question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  I walk with my parents, occasionally,  /
sd          A.17 utt2:  nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule, /
sd          A.17 utt3: {C and, }  {F um, } I play racquetball,  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C but } I haven't since  I've been out of school.  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C Because } I really don't like to exercise,  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  I think that's the basic point of it, is [ I'm not, + [ I, + I ] don't ] enjoy it --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- if I know that it's exercise,  /

sd          A.25 utt1:  -- {C so } I have to disguise it,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: it's  like feeding little babies food and  telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it. /  

aa          B.26 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  That's kind of the same thing for me.  /
sd          A.27 utt2:  I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Right.  /
bf          B.28 utt2: {C So } you look at it more as a task. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } yeah,  /
sd         A.29 utt2: if it's exercise, it's a task. /

sd          B.38 utt1:  -- {C and so, } it's interesting that  as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  My job at Texas Instruments,   I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, I   don't get any exercise doing that -- -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right. /  

sd         B.42 utt1:  -- {C and } plus there's a build up of stress -- /

sd(^q)       B.46 utt2:  {C so } even though I can look at it as a task, [ the, + ] {D you know, } [ I kind of get the,  + I get some kind of ] global benefit --   

b          A.47 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- from the whole thing by saying,  {D Well, } I'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and [ thus, + that ] type stuff. /

sd          B.56 utt2: something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  I do that at the end of the day,  /
sd          B.58 utt2:  {C and } it takes, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.58 utt3: [ [ that, + that ] + during that ] time the stress from the day goes away.  /
sd          B.58 utt4:   I get to share whatever I did with my wife, [ and, + and ] vice versa. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  Going to the gym [ is, + is ] actually  something different [ than, + than, ] {D like, } - /
sd          B.60 utt2: {F oh, } and the running,  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C and } I enjoy that too. /

sd          B.68 utt1:  -- {C and } you don't think about the pain of it.  /
sd          B.68 utt2:   [ [ You, + you, ] + you ] take the time to relax some how  /
sd          B.68 utt3: {C and } you think about other things.  /
sd          B.68 utt4:  During those first few months you have to think about running  and why your elbow hurts and --   

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- why you can't breathe and this and that,  /
sd          B.70 utt2:  {C and } that's no fun.  /
sv          B.70 utt3:  {C And } it's so  hard to get past that for a lot of people. /

sd          A.71 utt3: I never got past that stage. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Yeah,  /
