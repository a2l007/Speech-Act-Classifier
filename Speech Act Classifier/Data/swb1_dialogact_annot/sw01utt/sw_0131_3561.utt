=======================================================================
  

o          B.1 utt1:  All right,  /
%          B.1 utt2: {D well. } -/  

sv          A.2 utt1:  {F Um, } short term, I don't think  anything's going to be done about it --    

b          B.3 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.4 utt1:  -- or probably should be done about it. /  

qy          B.5 utt1:  {F Uh, } are you saying you don't think  anything should be done in the short term? /  

sv          A.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } the short term, the recession is  [ getting, + getting ] top attention. /  

aa          B.7 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.7 utt2: [ I, + I ] think that  you're absolutely right there.  /
sd          B.7 utt3: The other thing is,  is that we've got [ [ these, + {F um, } these, ] +   all these ] bank defaults going on, [ and, + and ]  savings and loan defaults, [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          A.8 utt1:  {C And } that effectively adds to whether  it's officially on the books or not. /  

aa          B.9 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          B.9 utt2: Exactly.  {F Um, } /  

sv          A.10 utt1:  {C And } that's got to be paid. /  

aa          B.11 utt1:  Exactly,  /
sv          B.11 utt2: [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C so } ]  this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.  /
sd          B.11 utt3:  {F Um, } I'm not really, {F uh, } sure that I even understand why the administration  is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that  [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] they're talking about reducing, {F uh, } the tax that needs to be paid,  or the tax that's currently being paid, then [ that can't, + it seems to me it can't ]  possibly, {D you know, } help with [ the, + the ] deficit picture. /  

sv          A.12 utt1:  It can only hurt the deficit picture. /  

aa          B.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.13 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          A.14 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } [ the, + the ]  severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting  you can do without, {F uh, } bringing [ on, + on  ] serious problems for the longer term. /
  
aa          B.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.15 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          A.16 utt1:  {C So } [ [ that, + that, ] + that's ] the current predicament. /  

aa          B.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.17 utt2: it [ see-, + seems ] like  [ it's, + it's ] a kind of a Catch Twenty-two.  /
%          B.17 utt3: {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] the, {F um, } - /
sd          B.17 utt4: my  understanding is [ what they're try-, +  [ what, +  what ] supposedly they're trying ] to do by reducing taxes  is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.17 utt5:  {C and } if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, {F uh, } which in turn will generate revenue.  /
sv          B.17 utt6:   {C But } [ it, + it ] seems [ like, +  like, ] {F uh, } it's sort of [ [ a, + {F uh, } a sp-, ] + an unending spiral, ]  /
%          B.17 utt7: {C and } [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] {F uh, } - /
sd          B.17 utt8:  [ I'm, + I'm ] not sure that there's any real  genuine truth to [ the, + {F uh, } the ] idea [ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ]  decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye   the Bush administration and  things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, {F uh, }  result in substantial amounts of money, {D you know, } for consumers to spend.  /
%          B.17 utt9: {C And, }  {F uh, } -/  

aa          A.18 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.18 utt2: I'm not sure how I feel about paying  on [ the quest, + the long term quests ] that tax cuts are worth at this point.  /
sv          A.18 utt3:   It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is. /  

aa          B.19 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.19 utt2: [ it, + {F uh, } it ]  would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do. /  

sv          A.20 utt1:  {D Well, } {D well, } first of all you  look to the Fed to fight the recession --   

b          B.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.22 utt1:  -- as indeed it has, with interest rates. /  

aa          B.23 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.23 utt2: I think that's been a positive development.  /
sv          B.23 utt3:   I think what that's done is  [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ]  help keep inflation from, {F um, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          A.24 utt1:  {D Well, } at the moment we're doing very well on inflation. /  

aa          B.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.25 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          A.26 utt1:  That's the sort of upside to the deficit. /  

sv          B.27 utt1:  It's a sort of a piece of luck. /  

sv          A.28 utt1:  That's the upside to the recession. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Yeah, {F um. }  /
h          B.29 utt2: I don't know,  /
qw          B.29 utt3: what kind of things do you think can be done [ [ in, + in, ] + {F uh, } in ] the long term? /  

sv          A.30 utt1:   ((   ))  {D Well, } can be done or will be done  are two different things.  /
sd          A.30 utt2: {F Um, } at various places to look [ for, + for ]  cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned --   

b          B.31 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          A.32 utt1:  -- depending on the world situation.  /
sv          A.32 utt2:   {C But } there are various other areas such [ as, + as ] farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.  /
sv          A.32 utt3:  {F Uh, } a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, {F uh, }  they should put [ a, + in ] - /
sv          A.32 utt4: the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor --   

b          B.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.34 utt1:  -- but left them for the middle class, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.34 utt2:  in the longer term, {F uh, } [ [ we, + we, ] + we'd ] do well, I think [ to make, + to make, ]  {F uh, } reductions there.  /
sv          A.34 utt3:  Also somewhat ((   ))  is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed. /  

aa          B.35 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.35 utt2: [  I think that, + I think [ that, +    that ] ] I agree with you certainly in the second situation, /
sd          B.35 utt3: {C and } I think certain entitlements  [ I, + I'm ] inclined to agree with you, too.  /
sv          B.35 utt4:  Education happens to be one  place where I think that we would foolish to {F um, } {F uh, } -/  

sd          A.36 utt1:  A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools --   

b          B.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.38 utt1:  -- which are sort of not colleges  /
sd          A.38 utt2: {C but }  schools that teach you trades, {D you know, } beautician --   

bk          B.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ I see, + I see ] what you're saying. /  

+           A.40 utt1:  -- {D well, } [ and + ] often exists only  because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans  for their full tuition, {F uh, } and the school gets paid off immediately, {F uh } -- /  

sv          B.41 utt1:  # [ {C And then } they # -- +   

^2          A.42 utt1:  -- # {C and then } they # don't provide very much education. /  

+          B.43 utt1:  -- {C and then } the people ] default --   

b          A.44 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.45 utt1:  -- on the loans.  /
sd           B.45 utt2: {D Well, } I would have  to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, {F uh, } around, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.45 utt3:  {C and } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,  /
sd          B.45 utt4:  [ {C but, } + {C but } ] taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely. /  

b          A.46 utt1:  Yeah. /
