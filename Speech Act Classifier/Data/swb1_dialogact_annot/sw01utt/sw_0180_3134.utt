b          A.41 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- both at home, - /
sv          B.42 utt2: they don't know what to expect at home.  /

sv          B.48 utt2: I think that's the main problem. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  {C And } school's now are supposed  to solve social problems, {F uh, } mental and  emotional problems --   

%          A.51 utt1:  {F Huh. } /

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  {C And } that's overwhelming. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  {D Well } [ we've got, + {F uh, } {D you know }   at our school we have  ] over a thousand elementary kids  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C and } last year was the  first year that we ever had more than one counselor.  /
sd          A.55 utt3: {C And } that's just really not enough. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  No.   /
aa          B.56 utt2: # It isn't. # /

sd(^q)       A.57 utt2: {C and } they said, {F oh, }  [ but + ] we need more  in the middle school because that's when kids are, {D you know, } at a tougher and rougher age and all that.  /
sd          A.57 utt3:  {C But, } {D you know, } part of my feeling is that if you [ solve, +  help ]  them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there. /  

aa          B.58 utt1:  True.  /
sv          B.58 utt2:  I think [ they, +  there ]  has to be at least a counselor  /
sd          B.58 utt3: {C and } we just recently had a counselor at elementary.  /
sd          B.58 utt4:   We didn't even have # counselors in elementary. # /  

b          A.59 utt1:  # Really. # /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  We have always, though, had three at  middle schools  because we had about a thousand kids  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C and } they divided them up  between three counselors  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C but } for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor  /
sd          B.60 utt4:  {C and } they decided that didn't work. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {D So } they started, {F uh, }  dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees --   

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /

b          A.67 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.68 utt1:  # {C And } I think # that would give  them more security in going to the counselor. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.70 utt1:  If they have a rapport with their counselor.  /
sd          B.70 utt2:  {D Now } if they don't,   

o@          A.71 utt1:  <Laughter>.

sd          B.74 utt2: {C And } occasionally that happens. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Right. /

sd          A.87 utt3: {C But, } anyway, one of the key things was [ that +  that ]  we believed that the public education is the best <lipsmack> <<pause>>  economic value.  /
