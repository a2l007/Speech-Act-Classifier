bk          A.3 utt1:  -- okay. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  I'll offer anything that I can on the subject.  /
sd          B.4 utt2:   {F Uh, } my husband and I [ just bought a, + just moved here ] recently  /
sd          B.4 utt3:  {C and, }  {F uh, } we bought, {F uh, } this house about, {F uh, } I don't know, year and a half ago. /
sd          B.4 utt4:   What we have here now is just a basic three bedroom, two bath, brick house which  is, {F uh, } completely different from what I had had before.  /
sd          B.4 utt5: When I was working and  before I married, {F uh, } I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and, {F uh, } historic old houses and things like that  /
sd          B.4 utt6: {C  so } I, {F uh, } tried to, - /

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C So, }  {F uh, } it had to have everything  done from top to bottom to having it leveled, jacked up, {F uh, } new plumbing,  new wiring, wallpaper, paint,  /

sd          B.10 utt2:  it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } I agree. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  I have done something, {F uh, } like that, too,  only not nearly as extensive. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  {C But } it must be interesting now trying to do  something to a basic ranch,

aa          B.22 utt1:  [ That's, + that's ] true.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:   When, {F uh, } I met my husband, he was living in an apartment at the time   /
sd          B.22 utt3: [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]   {F uh, } the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here. /

sd          B.22 utt7: we hadn't really planned on buying  /
sd          B.22 utt8:  {C and, }  as you probably heard [ from the, + in the ] Dallas and Texas area period the  housing market is just unreal.  /
sd          B.22 utt9:  {E I mean } you can get things for such a song. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C So, }  [ that's, + that's ] really why we  ended up in a house like this.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  This is not [ what we, + {D you know, } what we ]  want to stay in forever, because [ I have to have my, +  I've found that after doing this other house,  I have to have my ] hands into stuff  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C and, }   

b          A.25 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /

%          B.26 utt3:  {C so, } -/  

ad          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } maybe you can, {F uh, } make that  one charming [ and, + and ] make a little bit money, {F uh, } /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.28 utt2: [ That's, + that's ] the key, {D you know, }  /

sd          B.28 utt4: {C so } I feel sort of, {F uh, }  {D you know, } like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now <laughter> and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it.  /
sd          B.28 utt5:  {C So, } {F uh, } [ we'll see, +
