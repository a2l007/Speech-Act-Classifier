sd^t          A.1 utt1:  I guess we're supposed to talk about  what's being done about recycling. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Yes. /  

qy^g          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } lots, right? /  

na          B.4 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

o          A.5 utt1:  <Laughter> Finally. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Really,  /
qw          B.6 utt2: [ what, + what ] do you do, now? /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } we have saved our newspapers for years and years --    

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.9 utt1:  -- because the, {F uh, } Boy Scouts --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- our boys have been involved in have,  {F uh, } had a huge recycling bin, <lipsmack> over at Resurrection Lutheran Church -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } <lipsmack> {C so } ]  we've done that for quite some time,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C but } since the price of paper has gone down - /
sd          A.13 utt3:   {D like } it's about a fifth of what it used to be -- /  

bh          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  -- {C so } the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {D So } now we just put ours out for the City of Plano.  /
qy          A.17 utt2: Do you live in Plano? /  

ny          B.18 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          B.18 utt2: I do. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Okay,  /
b          A.19 utt2: yeah. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

qy          B.22 utt1:  Have you had yours now? /  

ny          A.23 utt1:  Yes. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  Although [ just, + just ]  about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, {F uh, } work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's why I asked you.  /
sd@          B.26 utt2: I guess [ it -- + -/  *[[ Why treated as a slash unit when it continues in B.28? ]] 

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd@          B.28 utt1:  -- {D you know, } it  ] does go in cycles,  /  *[[ I would treat this as a continuation of B.26 utt2 and label it '+' ]]
sd          B.28 utt2:  {C and } not everyone got theirs right away. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.29 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } [ I, +  I ] was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, [ make, + ] {D you know, } recycling the aluminum and --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Right,  /
b          A.33 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.33 utt3: we used --   

%          B.34 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh } -- -/  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- to take ours there. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  -- my garage was just getting overwhelmed. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:  <Laughter> I know. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C And, }  of course, I didn't go weekly,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C  so } it became quite a big --   

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  -- # thing,  /
%          B.40 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } # -/  

aa          A.41 utt1:  # Right,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: I'm really glad # they do it.  /
%          A.41 utt3:   {F Uh, } yeah,  /
sd          A.41 utt4: I do news, mostly newspapers and, {F uh, } plastic two liter diet Coke bottles <laughter>.   

b          B.42 utt1:  Yes,  /
b          B.42 utt2: yeah. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  And aluminum cans some,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C but } I don't use as many of those. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  I guess the ones that are hard to  convince yourself to do are the ones [ that you have to really, + that are really  dirty that you have ] to wash out <laughter>. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {D well, } I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two. /  

ba          A.47 utt1:  {F Uh, } ha. /  

b^m          B.48 utt1:  {F Uh, } ha,  /
sd@          B.48 utt2: {C so } it was wasting a lot of time.  *[[ Why no slash?  B's next utterance is a backchannel to A.49. ]]

bf          A.49 utt1:  Wasting all your time and effort and,    

+@          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /   *[[ Should be independent slash unit]]

+          A.51 utt1:  # Putting it in there. # /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  # Thinking I was safe # in buying those  jars as far as the environment was concerned. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.53 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> {D you know, }  {C but } [ it, + it's ] not that hard now that I've got this --   

^2          A.55 utt1:  # Got your routine down. # /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- # system under control. # /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.59 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess there are some places,  {F uh, } in the north, in particular that, {F uh, } have a real definite way of encouraging  you to recycle  /
sd          A.59 utt2: {C because } [ they charge you, +  let's see, they charge you ]  for your garbage pick up by the weight. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  {F Uh, } uh-huh. /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  {C So } if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.62 utt2: I do find that I don't have as much to throw away --   

b          A.63 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.64 utt1:  -- because --   

aa          A.65 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.66 utt1:  -- all the bulky things [ are, + are -- ]   

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  -- being tossed in --   

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- with the recycling.  /
sd          B.70 utt2: {C And, }  {F uh, }  I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, {F uh, } <lipsmack> - /
t1          B.70 utt3: what are some of the things they don't recycle.  /
sd          B.70 utt4:   {F Oh, } one thing I thought about the other day were batteries,  /
sd          B.70 utt5: just everyday regular batteries.    

%          A.71 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.72 utt1:  Supposedly, {D you know, } leak [ and, +  and ] contaminate --   

b          A.73 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.74 utt1:  -- the landfills  /
qh          B.74 utt2: {C and, }  yet,  what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out. /  

aa          A.75 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
aa          A.75 utt2: right. /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  {C And } they don't take, -/  

sv          A.77 utt1:  Probably going to throw them in your trash <laughter>. /  

aa          B.78 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.78 utt2: that's what happens  /
%          B.78 utt3: {C because, } -/  

sd          A.79 utt1:  {D Well, } there are places that take car batteries,  /
sd          A.79 utt2: {C but } I wonder if they would take, -/  

b          B.80 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.81 utt1:  {E I mean, } not that it would <laughter>, - /
sd          A.81 utt2:  kind of a pain to, {D you know, } drive over somewhere special [ just for that, +   for two ] little tiny batteries  /
%          A.81 utt3: {C but, } -/  

aa          B.82 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.82 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.82 utt3: {C but } I think the city one could possibly look into that or something. /  

aa          A.83 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.83 utt2: that's true. /  

sd          B.84 utt1:  {F Uh, } if they've got these bins for all the other little items, - /
sv          B.84 utt2: I'm sure if [ p-, +  people ] will have batteries,  {F uh, } {D you know, } quite often --   

aa          A.85 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          A.85 utt2: that's true. /  

+          B.86 utt1:  -- [ to, +  to ] toss out. /  

sd          A.87 utt1:  {F Uh, } when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] truck came by, {D well, } we all ran out to  watch it because, {D you know, } we'd never <laughter> really seen it --   

b          B.88 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.89 utt1:  -- pick up our stuff  /
sd          A.89 utt2:  {C and } one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, {F uh, }  scanned across the little bar code --   

b          B.90 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.91 utt1:  -- on our bin --   

bh          B.92 utt1:  {F Oh, } is that right? /  

+          A.93 utt1:  -- as soon as he took the stuff  /
sd          A.93 utt2:  {C and } he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, {D you know, } scanned it,  /
sd          A.93 utt3:  {D so } I don't know [ why, +  what ] that was reading it for -- /  

%          B.94 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

%          A.95 utt1:  -- {C but, }  {F uh } -- -/

%          A.99 utt2: Another, -/  

qh          B.100 utt1:  Wouldn't it be nice if you could  get a credit back at the end of the year <laughter>. /  

bf          A.101 utt1:  {F Ooh, } for those who are really cooperating. /  

b          B.102 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.103 utt1:  {D Now, } that would encourage it. /  

sv          B.104 utt1:  {D Well, } except I know it would  just not be cost effective.  /
sd          B.104 utt2:  They've already got all this money out on [ hiring, +  {F uh, }  getting the trucks and hiring ] people to work them.  /
sv          B.104 utt3: I'm sure they couldn't afford --   

b          A.105 utt1:  Sure. /

sd          A.109 utt2: {D now } there  is just one garbage man that comes --   

b          B.110 utt1:  Yeah. /

b          B.112 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.113 utt1:  {D So } that's interesting.  /
sd          A.113 utt2:  {F Uh, } also, slightly off the subject, but [ our, +  our ] big green garbage thing got stolen. /  

bh          B.114 utt1:  {F Oh, } it did? /
