=======================================================================
  

o          A.1 utt1:   For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology. /  

bk          B.2 utt1:   {F Oh, } okay,  /
qy^d          B.2 utt2: {C so } it's right up your alley, then. /  

na          A.3 utt1:   I suppose so.  /
ad^t          A.3 utt2:  Let me push the button. /  

aa          B.4 utt1:   All right. /  

b          @A.5 utt1:   <Beep>  Okay, {F uh, }  /
sd          @A.5 utt2: I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system,  /
sv          @A.5 utt3: {C but, }  {F uh, } I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.6 utt2: I don't think it's going to happen either,  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  {C but } I wish it were  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C because } [ I'm a, + I got my ]  bachelor's in mechanical engineering. /  

b          A.7 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:   I'm at grad school now in acoustics  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {C and } all we do is metric stuff. /  

br          A.9 utt1:   You're now in what? /  

sd^r          B.10 utt1:   Acoustics. /  

b^m          A.11 utt1:   Acoustics, {F uh. } /  

aa          B.12 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C so } everything's metric  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  {C and then } you go to read some order book or something  /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C and } it's all confusing  /
sd          B.12 utt5: {C so } I don't understand as much,  /
sv          B.12 utt6: {C so } I think we should get one adopted permanently. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:   {D Well, } I guess that is the policy,  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  {C but } it's been the policy for a long time  /
sv          A.13 utt3: {C and } nothing ever happens.  /
sv          A.13 utt4:  {F Uh, } I suppose [ things, + some things ] {D well } happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation come up that's more used to it. /  

aa          B.14 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to. /  

bf          A.15 utt1:   They have to for international trade. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:   {C But, }  I [ g-, + guess ] [ it's, + it's ] easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, {F uh, }  [ [ be-, + be-, ] + because ]  [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of ] computers coming into everything. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:   Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.18 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.18 utt3: I don't think switching back  and forth is that big a deal.  /
sv          B.18 utt4: I think people need to understand more {D like } what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms.  /
sd          B.18 utt5:  {C Because } someone says a kilogram,  /
sv          B.18 utt6: no one knows what that is. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:   Everyone [ wants a, + wants a ] conversion of that before kind of recognizing it [ as a, + [ [ [ as, + as, ] + as, ] + as ] a ]  concept to hold in mind. /  

b          B.20 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:   {F Uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  don't see that, [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] can change it very quickly.  /
sv          A.21 utt2:  {E I mean } we're not the kind of society  [ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ] something can be posed upon, {F uh, } by government will. /  

aa          B.22 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: no one seems to be adopting it.  /
sv          B.22 utt3:   Metric system, [ no one's very, + {F uh, } no one wants ] it at all seems like. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:   {F Uh, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]  public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, {F uh, } money, dollar, coins, anything like that. /  

b          B.24 utt1:   Yeah <laughter>. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:   [ [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ it + <breathing>,  it ] obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world [ in, + in ] using the old system. /  

aa          B.26 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: [ I, + it's ]  pretty tough when you get everything confused, though.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: I think two systems is worse than one, though <laughter>.  /
sd          B.26 utt4: {C Because, } I know, we do a lot of problems and things  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C and } they're half english and half metric  /
sd          B.26 utt6: {C and } <noise>  [ you, + you ] make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems.   /
sv          B.26 utt7: ((   ))  just get one.  /
sd          B.26 utt8:   I prefer metric,  /
sv           B.26 utt9: {C but } even if it's english, they should just have one. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:   {D Well, } {E I mean, } unfortunate-,  I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:   <Laughter> Yeah <laughter>,  /
aa^r          B.28 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.28 utt3: I think so.  /
sv          B.28 utt4:  [ Your, + your ] average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:   <Lipsmack> {F Uh, } {E I mean, } there are things you could do.  /
sd(^q)       A.29 utt2:  {F Uh, } we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour. /  

b          B.30 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:   {F Uh, } {C but } that hasn't been adopted very widely. /  

b          B.32 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: they have some of those in Ohio.  /
sd          B.32 utt3:  There's this one sign's kind of funny.  /
sd(^q)       B.32 utt4:  It says, {F uh, } metric signs next hundred miles. /  

x          A.33 utt1:   <Laughter>.   

x          B.34 utt1:   <Laughter>.   

sv          A.35 utt1:   <Lipsmack> [ {C But, } + {E I mean, } {C and  } ] no one [ will, + will ] go a step further to remove the english signs. /  

aa          B.36 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.36 utt2: that would force everybody to use it.  Or to quit selling tape measures in inches. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:   {F Uh, } yeah,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: {C or, }  you have highway signs saying speed limit, {F uh, } eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: I guess a hundred is sixty-two. /  

bf          A.39 utt1:   Hundred car is going sixty-two,  /
b          A.39 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {D  so } it would be more [ like, + {F uh, } like ] ninety I guess,  /
sd          A.39 utt4:  car is going fifty-five.  /
sv           A.39 utt5: {F Uh, } you suddenly [ have a + <laughter> have a ] even worse problem with speeding than we do now. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.40 utt2: you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety <laughter>. /  

qy          A.41 utt1:   [ [ Do, + do, ] + do ] you know,  where you are, /
qy          A.41 utt2: do the schools emphasize the metric system? /  

ny          B.42 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.42 utt2: in the engineering they all do pretty much. /  

ar          A.43 utt1:   No,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: [ {E [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] meant, } +  {E I meant } ] down, like, in the elementary schools. /  

bf          B.44 utt1:   {F Oh, } in the elementary schools.  /
no          B.44 utt2:  I don't know.  /
sd          B.44 utt3:   I wouldn't think so.  /
sd          B.44 utt4: I remember --   

%          A.45 utt1:   {E I mean, } I think, -/  

+          B.46 utt1:   -- a ways back we did like conversions,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C but } we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system. /  

b          A.47 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {E I mean, } I think my children learned the metric system,  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C but } it doesn't [ get, + get ] emphasized over the other. /  

b          B.48 utt1:   Yeah,  /
bf          B.48 utt2: they learn how many centimeters are in an inch  /
sv          B.48 utt3: {C and } that's about it. /
