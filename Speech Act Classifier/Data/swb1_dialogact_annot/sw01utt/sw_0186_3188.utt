x          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          @B.4 utt1:  because I just did my first two painting projects ever. /  

bh          A.5 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  Was [ not, +  not ] a big deal -- /  

qw          A.7 utt1:  What kind of --   

sd          B.8 utt1:  -- two little deals, -/  

+          A.9 utt1:  -- painting was it? /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  The first one, {F um, } - /
sd          B.10 utt2: I helped someone  repaint an apartment,  /
sd          B.10 utt3: {C and } it was very easy. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
bh          A.11 utt2: [ it, +  was it? ] /  

ny          B.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.12 utt2: {C and } I've never painted anyth-,  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  I always thought it would be, - /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C so, } {D you know, }  you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something -- /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah, /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  -- {C but } I know I can do it. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C And } the second one was I bought  some toys [ at a, +  {F um, } at a ] craft fair. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and so } I decided to paint them,  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C and } that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment <laughter>. /  

qw          A.19 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } {D well, } what kind of paint did you use for the, {F um, } bookends? /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ it's, +  {F uh, } it, ] +   that's ] half the problem right there is that [ it wasn't, +  it was ] a oil base,  /
sd          B.20 utt2:  {C so } I had to get, - /
sd          B.20 utt3: {C and } when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.  /
sd          B.20 utt4: {C So } I [ had it, +  had it ] all over my hands.  /
sd          B.20 utt5:  At first I didn't realize, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.20 utt6: I had never painted anything,  /
sd          B.20 utt7: {C so } I didn't realize --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- that I needed that.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  {E I mean, } I kind of knew, in the back of my mind, /  

qy^d          A.23 utt1:  {D So } you can't use oil on wood? /  

nn          B.24 utt1:  {D Well, } no,  /
sd^e          B.24 utt2: you can use it on wood,  /
sd^r          B.24 utt3:  {C but } I just had it all over my hands,  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } I went to wash the brushes out,   and, {F uh, } wash my hands,  /
sd          B.24 utt5: {C and } you can't wash it off with water.  /
sd          B.24 utt6: You have to get [ the, + {F uh, } a ] solution  /
%          B.24 utt7: {C and, } -/  

bf          A.25 utt1:  {F Oh, } <laughter> {D so } you had to go around with paint all over you,   

aa          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: I had to drive to the store -- /  

+          A.27 utt1:  # temporarily, anyway. # /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  -- # yeah,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: I had to drive # to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy --   

b          A.29 utt1:  {F Oh, } <laughter>. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- some paint thinner,  [ and ((   )) +    and ] everything like that,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C and then, } {F um, } downstairs in the apartment,  [ I just us-, +  we just used ] a latex base, /
sd          B.30 utt3: {C and so } you can drip it on, {D you know }  /
sd          B.30 utt4: if you dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real easy to clean. /  

qy          A.31 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ is, +  is ]  that what you usually use in the house, is latex? /  

ny          B.32 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.32 utt2: [ {C and, } +   {C and } -- ]   

%          A.33 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.34 utt1:  -- [ it, +  it ] just  like - /
sd          B.34 utt2: the same with the toys, - /
sv          B.34 utt3: it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it, {D you know, }  /
sd(^q)       B.34 utt4: it says Safe for Children, and all that. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  <Inhaling>  Uh-huh,  /
b          A.35 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: I heard about that.  /
sd          A.35 utt4: I guess a friend of mine had a, {F uh, } {D well, } - /
sd          A.35 utt5: [ she, +   she ] just started up a day care center,  /
sd          A.35 utt6: {C and } {F uh, } [ the, +   one of the ] real strict, {F uh, } restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  -- {C so, }  {F uh, } she had that done.  /

qy          B.38 utt1:  Have you painted anything recently. /  

na@          A.39 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } so to speak,  I had to paint [ this, +  {F uh, } the ] inside of this warehouse thing --   *[[ I would have put a slash after the answer "so to speak" ]]

qy          B.40 utt1:  Wow, was it huge? /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- that you keep some, {F um, } farm equipment in -- /  

ny          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } what I had to do  is just coat this bare wood with a sealer,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } I had this big  five gallon jug,  /
sd          A.43 utt3: {C and } it was like paint thinner.  /
sd          A.43 utt4: {E I mean } [ I, +  {D you know, } it ]  looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner -- /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } you just took a  roller and put it on there,  /
sd          A.45 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } if you saw that the wood was getting wet,  {D you know, } [ that was, +  that was ] all you needed.  /
%          A.45 utt3:  {C So. } -/  

ba          B.46 utt1:  Wow. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: it  was, - /
sd          A.47 utt3: it used all of it.  /
sd          A.47 utt4:   I guess it was about three hundred yards worth.  /
sd          A.47 utt5: {C So. }    {D Well, } I guess it worked out.  /
sd          A.47 utt6:  It was pretty easy, actually. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: I think though, {F um, } we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work, because I don't know if I could, {D you know, }  /
