b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C And } I could see that many of them  had conscientious objections to war or  whatever.  /
sd          B.10 utt2:  {C But } [ I, + I ]  felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. Be it cleaning out, {F uh, } lots,  [ in, + in ] their neighborhood or,

sd          B.14 utt4:   I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four. /

sd          B.16 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and } I find ways [ to, + to ]  turn some of that back [ to, + to ] others.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } [ I, + I ] guess [ I, + I ] can't see that as  being something to really object to. /  

sv          A.17 utt1: {D Well, } I guess it would still depend on how,  /
sv          A.17 utt2: {E I mean, } [ [ if, + if you're talking about any-, ] + if you're talking about something ] that's like [ a full time, + {D you know, } one year full time, ] {D you know, }  this is what you do, {D you know. }  /

sd          B.18 utt1:  I could see [ [ [ a, + a full, ] + a run-, ] +   a gamut ] of different kinds of opportunities.  /
sd          B.18 utt2: Things that need to be done,    

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

+          B.22 utt1:  {F uh, } a day, or several hours of the week.   Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that. In addition to what one does,   

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  {F uh, } besides that.  /
sd          B.24 utt2: [ I, + I ]  can't, imagine what kind of, {F uh, } {F uh, } bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time,  /
^q          B.24 utt3: {F oh, }   you're going to go to this camp  /
^q          B.24 utt4: {C and } you're going to, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.24 utt5:  {D like, } {F um, } back in the Depression, the C C C,   

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+@       B.26 utt1:  the construction corps that went out and did things.  That was great,  /  *[[ Why isn't "That was great" an independent slash unit? ]]
sv          B.26 utt2: it was needed,  /
sv          B.26 utt3: it gave some folks some jobs,  /
sv          B.26 utt4:  {C and } we got some great public works out of it.  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C But, }  {F um, } I don't see that  as being necessary now.  /
sd          B.26 utt6: I can see it being done, {F uh, } on a regular schedule. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {F Uh, } everybody has to put in so  many hours of, {F uh, } public service in a given time, perhaps. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] guess I see all of us benefiting,  /
sd          B.30 utt2:  {C and } [ I, + I ] don't see it just relegated to the young.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: {C But } [ I see, + [ I, + I ] see ] so  much going on that, that's bad.  /
sv          B.30 utt4: {C And } this would give them a  chance to have some positive self-esteem. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  Something that they turn,   

%          A.33 utt1:  {D Well, } -/  

+          B.34 utt1:  back. /  

sv          A.35 utt1:  {C and } also, {D you know, } [ you, + you ]  feel more like, {D you know, } you're actually part of the community if you've done something,   

aa          B.36 utt1:  That's right. /

sv          B.38 utt1:  You take pride in that, [ and, + and ]  get [ some, + some ] positive feedback from those who benefit,   

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  besides yourself.  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C And } [ I, + I ]  see it being most beneficial if it's in [ the neighborhood where + {E or, }  {E or } at least the area where ] the person lives. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  {F Uh, } definitely. /  

sv           B.42 utt1:  It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then [ you're, + you're ] coming in contact with it.  /
sd          B.42 utt2:  It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there  that I'll never be able to see again, unless I happen to go on vacation,   

b          A.43 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  up there. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sv          B.46 utt1:  [ It's, + it almost needs ]  to be something that has more impact for the individual, on going. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd            B.48 utt1:  {C But } as far as putting that into work,  [ I don't want to, + <laughter> I don't want to ] deal [ with the, + with the ]  heartache of, first of all, getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics,   

sv          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } that would,   

+          B.50 utt1:  of it. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  be a nightmare.  /
sv           A.51 utt2: {C And } [ just, +   {E I mean, } just ] [ getting, + getting ] it going. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  [ I, + I, ] see a lot of things like, {F uh, } scouting, {F uh, }   

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, things like that,  that kind of get into that citizenship, {F uh, } the {F uh, }  looking after the environment sort of thing -- /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  -- {C And } I guess, I don't see, {F uh, }  this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in,   

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  and would take a turn in. /

sd          B.64 utt4:  when I was teaching school I saw [ many, + so many ] kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose.  /
sd          B.64 utt5:  {C And } I can see, {D you know, } [ some, + some ] really significant things coming out of it. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  I know you've got to get past [ that, +  that ] grudge attitude that many have,  /

sv@           B.68 utt1:  The adults, {F uh, } ahead of it  would probably never serve  [ and, + and ] to each succeeding generation.    There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign in each community, each county,   *[[ This is clearly 2 slash units.  Why wasn't it parsed that way? ]]
