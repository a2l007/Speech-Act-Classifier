o          B.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qw          B.1 utt2: what do you feel are some of the main problems? /  

sd          A.2 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I'm in a, +  I'm in an ]  urban area.  /
sd          A.2 utt2: I'm in Dallas. /  

b          B.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.4 utt1:  {C And } we're finding that crime is  going up very quickly and has become a major problem, {F uh, } even a more major problem.  /
sd          A.4 utt2:   {F Uh, } in Dallas, some of the major problems, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.4 utt3: drugs seems to be  [ re-, +  related ] to quite a bit of the crime we have now.  /
sd          A.4 utt4:  There is a lot of theft, a lot of  assault dealing with, {F uh, } people trying to get money for drugs. /  

b          B.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.6 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I think that's a national problem, though. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  [ [ It, +  it, ] +  it's -- ]   

sv          A.8 utt1:  It's not unique, /  

+          B.9 utt1:  -- pretty bad here, too.  /
sd          B.9 utt2:  We've had a lot of murders drug related and  stuff.    

b          A.10 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.11 utt1:  In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh. /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qy^g          A.12 utt2: {D Well, } now, we're pretty  close to the golden triangle, aren't you? /  

ny          B.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.13 utt2: [ that, +  that ] - /
sd          B.13 utt3:   Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle. /  

aa          A.14 utt1:  Right,  /
bf          A.14 utt2: research triangle --   

aa          B.15 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.16 utt1:  -- and all of that.  /
sv          A.16 utt2:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I'm sure you have a lot of students there, {F uh, }  and a lot of researchers  /
sv          A.16 utt3: {C so }  [ you, +  you ] may have [ a, +  {D you know, } perhaps a ] little better economic climate, /
sv          A.16 utt4:  {C but, }  in all your cities now, it seems like  [ th-, +  there ] is [ a, +  a ] crowd that's really effected by this bill. /  

aa          B.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.17 utt2: [ [ it's, +  it's ] + really, it's,  ] - /
sd          B.17 utt3:  {C and } I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh [ [ or, +  or -- ] +    

bh          A.18 utt1:  Really? /  

+          B.19 utt1:  -- or ] Chapel Hill.  /
sd          B.19 utt2:   Chapel Hill is kind of [ a, +  a ] ritzy city or whatever.  /
sd          B.19 utt3: {E I mean, } it's kind of, - /
sd          B.19 utt4: [ I'm, +  I'm ] sure  there is problems with it,  /
sd          B.19 utt5: {C but } it has a pretty low crime rate.  [ Compare, +  compared ]  [ to, +  to, ] Durham has probably got the worst.  /
sd          B.19 utt6:  They've had {D like } forty-eight murders  since the beginning of the year. /  

bh          A.20 utt1:  Really? /  

sd          B.21 utt1:  {C And } over half of it has been drug related. /  

sd          A.22 utt1:  {F Um. }  {D Well, } here, {F uh, }  I'm not sure how many Dallas has had.  /
%          A.22 utt2:  I've, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.22 utt3:  Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four,  /
h          A.22 utt4:  [ I, +  I ] don't know.  /
sd          A.22 utt5: [ A, + a ] number every week. -/  

b          B.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.24 utt1:  {F Uh, } Dallas is having quite a few.  /
sd          A.24 utt2:   Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night [ or, + or, ] like I say, drug related.  /
sv          A.24 utt3:   {F Uh, } I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is  the decrease in values.  /
sv          A.24 utt4: Seems  like [ a, +  a ] lot of people don't  hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to. /  

b          B.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } I, -/  

%          B.27 utt1:  {D Well, } that, - /
sd          B.27 utt2: [ {C and } the, +  {C and } the ]  economy is so bad  /
sd          B.27 utt3: [ {C and, } +    

bf          A.28 utt1:  The economy is lousy <laughter>. /  

+          B.29 utt1:  {C And so } ] many people have been  laid off and stuff.  /
sd          B.29 utt2: They've done special stories on the news, local news here. /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.31 utt1:  We had a lot of bank robberies and  [ different, +  lot  of ] break ins and stuff.  /
sd          B.31 utt2: I know, like a week or so ago, - /
sd          B.31 utt3: I live [ in a, +   in a ] town house, which  is,  {D you know, } - /
sd          B.31 utt4: it's a pretty nice neighborhood  /
sd          B.31 utt5:  {C and } this lady was going to work,  /
sd          B.31 utt6: she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything.  /
sd          B.31 utt7: {C And } nobody thought any different,  /
sd          B.31 utt8:  they just thought she was moving.  /
sd          B.31 utt9:  It was a moving man pulled  right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned <laughter>. /  

sv          A.32 utt1:  Boy [ that really, + that really ]  takes someone who is bold to do that. /  

aa          B.33 utt1:  {D Well, } yeah,  /
sv          B.33 utt2: [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +  it's ]  pretty bad <laughter>. /  

qy          A.34 utt1:  {D Well, } now, do you find that security  is very good [ [ in, +  in a, ] +  in a ] town home? /  

na          B.35 utt1:  {F Uh, } I would say so for the majority  [ [ in, +  in  our, ] + in my ] little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home -- /  

b          A.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.37 utt1:  -- {C and } we all know one another  /
sd          B.37 utt2:  [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  on our one little section of the street we all know one another  and know that we're not moving <laughter> and  different things like that. /  

%          A.38 utt1:  {D Well, } that, -/  

%          B.39 utt1:  It's, - /
sd          B.39 utt2: [ [ I, +  I'm, ] +  I'm ]  probably [ the, +  one of the ] youngest people that live over here. /  

bk          A.40 utt1:  I see. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:  Most people [ are, +  are, ] retired  /
sd          B.41 utt2: [ [ {C or, } +  {C or, } ] +  {C or, } ]  {D you know, } [ they're, +  they're ] in their forties [ or, +  or ] whatever.  /
sd          B.41 utt3:   [ {C So } +  {C and } ] I'm in my twenties,  /
sd          B.41 utt4:  {C so } [ [ I, +  I'm, ] +  I'm ] out more than they are,  /
sd          B.41 utt5: {C but } --   

b          A.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.43 utt1:  -- they're at home at night,  /
sd          B.43 utt2:  {C so } I really don't worry about anything. /  

sv          A.44 utt1:  {D Well, } I think you hit on one  point there is you know each other. /  

b          B.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.46 utt1:  [ I'm, +  I'm ]  in a neighborhood  where we try to keep up with everything.  /
sd          A.46 utt2:  {F Uh, } I am, {F oh, } about three blocks off a major road   and, {F uh, } a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, - /
sd          A.46 utt3:  I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and [ the, +  the ] commercial districts  /
sd          A.46 utt4: {C and, }  {F uh, } I'm over the northeast part of Dallas.  /
sd          A.46 utt5: It's [ a, +  in a ]  nice neighborhood.  /
sd          A.46 utt6:  The houses here, {F uh, }  before the recession  were running two hundred thousand or so  /
sd          A.46 utt7: {C and, }  course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now. /  

b          B.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.47 utt2: {D see, } that's the same thing here. /  

sd          A.48 utt1:  {C But } we have, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.48 utt2: [ one, +  one ]  thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away /
sd          A.48 utt3:  {C and } now the economy is bad,  /
sd          A.48 utt4: they have trouble keeping those full  /
sd          A.48 utt5: {C  so } they've dropped the, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.48 utt6: they're not nearly as selective as they used to be. /  

b          B.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.50 utt1:  {C And, }  course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex.  /
sv          A.50 utt2:  You start letting that happen and they go down  /
sv          A.50 utt3:  {C and then } before  you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things  /
sv          A.50 utt4: {C  so, }  {F uh, } I'm sure that aggravates it also. /  

b          B.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.52 utt1:  {C But, }  unemployment now in Dallas,  or in Texas is up around six point, -/
