sd          B.2 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } instead of just {D like } tossing everything away which I always felt bad about, {F uh, } I am starting to [ split stu-, + split stuff ] up.  /
sd          B.2 utt5: The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb.  /
sd          B.2 utt6: They make me drive it {D like } a mile down the road and spit it out down there.  /
qw          B.2 utt7: What are they doing up there? /  

sd          A.3 utt1: {D Well, } here in Saskatoon, {F uh, } <inhaling> much the same thing.  /
sd          A.3 utt2: There is no curb pick up of, {F uh, } any of the recycled products.  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {F Uh, } we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people.  /
sd          A.3 utt4: {F Uh, } there are areas where we could, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.3 utt5: actually we have a couple of the, {F uh, } handicapped societies, types of places where the {F uh, } <inhaling> one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers  /
sd          A.3 utt6: {C so, } {F uh, } we are able to, {F uh, } have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing  /
sd          A.3 utt7: {C and then } [ there are, + there's ] a {F uh, } deposit program on plastic and glass containers. {D Well, } primarily soft drink bottles  /
sd          A.3 utt8: {C and so } we are able {F uh } to take it to one of the {F uh, } rehabilitation centers  /
sd          A.3 utt9: {C and then } they recycle the containers.  /
sd          A.3 utt10: They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container  /
%          A.3 utt11: {C and then, } -/  

qy^d          B.4 utt1:  [ The, + the ] deposits only on {D like } drink stuff. /

b          B.8 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.9 utt1: -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] they induce recycling of plastic and glass, soft drink containers.  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {F Uh, } we do have one of the scrape  metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well -- /  

bk          B.10 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          A.11 utt1: -- [ {C and } actually the recycler, + {A there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans } {C and so } the recycler, ] {F uh, } with the handicapped group will also accept those.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C So, } {F uh, } it's [ fairly, + fairly ] extensive,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {C but } then again [ it's + {F uh, } it's ] the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city. /  

qy          B.12 utt1: {D So, } did they, - /
qy          B.12 utt2: [ you're giving, + are you giving ] these products to the handicapped group  /

bk          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh. }  Okay. /  

sd          A.15 utt1: Generally [ the, + {F uh, } the ] handicapped group takes care of the things that - /
sd          A.15 utt2: actually, the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to [ re-, + recycle ] the bottle so that you get your money back  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and then } the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit  /
sd          A.15 utt4: [ {C and then } I, + {C and then } they ] in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer [ as + as ] well <noise>. /  

ba          B.16 utt1: That's very cool.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {D You know } [ there's a, + I heard about a ] similar program in New York City where, {F uh, } a thing called {D like } Homeless Incorporated or something like that, - /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C but } what they do is employ, {F uh, } [ homeless, + {A I think mostly men, but } homeless ] people to {F uh, } go out and collect all the recyclable cans  /
sd          B.16 utt4: [ {C and } + {C and } ] I think it's mostly cans.  /
sd          B.16 utt5: There may be bottles as well, but {D like } beer cans, soda cans and what not  /
sd          B.16 utt6: {C and } they, {F uh, } bring them up to [ [ a + one lo-, ] + one centralized location ] and, {F uh, } are able to collect the money from the various beer [ and, + and ] soda manufacturers [ and, + {F uh, } and ] get more money to these people that desperately need it. /  

b          A.17 utt1: {F Oh } yeah.  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {F Uh, } I guess partly because of our climate. - /

sd          A.19 utt2: We certainly have a fair number of people that are on [ welfa-, + welfare ] and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing.  /
sd          A.19 utt3: <inhaling> {F Uh, } there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, {F uh, } scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, {F uh, } regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes. /  

qy          B.20 utt1:  Do they do it with news papers as well? /
