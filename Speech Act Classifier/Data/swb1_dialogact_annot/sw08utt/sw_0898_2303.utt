o          @A.1 utt1:  All right,  /
ad@          @A.1 utt2: we need to discuss the voters.

sv          A.5 utt2:  I blame it to apathy. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.6 utt2: {F um, } [ I, + I ] suspect the apathy is due to something like people just feeling [ that, + that ] their vote doesn't count anyway.  /
qh          B.6 utt3: {E I mean, } [ why, + why ] bother voting [ if, + {F um, } if ] your vote won't make a difference.  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C So } for instance, in, {F um, } the last presidential election, I'm sure a lot of people thought, {F Oh, } Bush is going to win either way,  /
qh          B.6 utt5: why bother voting. /  

qh          A.7 utt1:  Why should I go out of my way when it doesn't matter. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  That's right.  /

qh          B.8 utt4: {C so } are only the same two caucuses, certainly not going to win, why bother voting for him.  /
sv          B.8 utt5:  {C So. } [ I thi-, + I think ] that's [ [ a big, + {F uh, } a big, ] + a big ] reason for it.  /
qo          B.8 utt6: How abou-, -/  

aa          A.9 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think so, too.  /
sv          A.9 utt2:  {C And } I think the other thing is the news [ me-, + media ] puts such a blitz on it that they [ we-, + ] had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  {F Um, } that's true.  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {D Actually } I never thought about that,  /

sv          A.11 utt1:  {C And } [ I, + I ] think [ the, + ] [ you hear the news, + {D you know, } you start out in the morning, and all day you hear the  news, ]  /
sv@          A.11 utt2: {C and } by time, {D say } you get off work and  go to vote.  You feel like it doesn't make any difference.    

aa          B.12 utt1:  That's true,  /
aa^r          B.12 utt2: that's true. /  

+@          A.13 utt1:  Due to the overabundance of news we have available to us. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qw          A.15 utt1:  What do you think on the local elections though? /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  I think on the local elections it's actually, {F um, } - /
sv          B.16 utt2: [ I think, + {F um, } I think ] people vote in the larger elections because they feel like, {D well, } {D you know, } the country's real important,  /
sv          B.16 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } [ if I, + if ] we help elect a president who's going to save us, [ then, + then ] the whole country will be saved.  /
sv          B.16 utt4: {C But } they figure local elections don't mean that much, I suspect.  /
sv          B.16 utt5:  {C So } people don't really worry about their local mayor or something, [ figuring that, + {D you know, } {A and I think wrongly, } figuring [ that, +  that, ] ] {D well, } what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now, [ and + {D you know, } and ] stuff like that.  /
sv           B.16 utt6:  {C So } people think [ [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] they don't have, + {F um, } [ that, + that ] ] it doesn't matter as much, whereas I think it's probably just the opposite is true.  /
sv          B.16 utt7:  I think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think so, too.  /
aa          A.17 utt2:  Absolutely.  /
sv          A.17 utt3: {F Uh, } I think another thing, - /

sv          A.19 utt1:  I think that the people that [ are, + ] have, {F um, } a lower income, which you automatically equate with lower education --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /

sv(^q)          A.23 utt3: {C or } when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today, they say, {D Well, } I would -- /

sd          B.26 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] possible.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: I still think that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference, though, as well.  /
sv(^q)          B.26 utt4:  I think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote, [ [ are, + are, ] + are ] a lot of the people who think that {D well, } look at me, I'm just a little nobody.  /
^q          B.26 utt5:  My vote's not going to count anyway.  /

sv          B.26 utt7: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  I had an interesting comment one time, a thought that would never have crossed my mind.  /
sd(^q)          A.27 utt2: I had someone tell me that, I will never register to vote because I don't want to serve on a jury <laughter>. /  

br          B.28 utt1:  {F Um? }  /
qw          B.28 utt2: What do they have to do with one another? /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  <Laughter> [ I just, + [ I, + ]  [ they, + ] I just ] wandered off from that one.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: I was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection. /  

bf          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } {C so } they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever. /  

%          A.31 utt1:  {C So } they wor-, - /
sd          A.31 utt2: if they don't vote, they don't have to be on a jury. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {F Oh, } I didn't realize that actually.  /
%          B.32 utt2:  That, -/  

sv          A.33 utt1:  There is convoluted logic for you. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: there is.  /
sv          B.34 utt3:  There are much easier ways to get out of jury duty. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  <Laughter>  Yes. /

b^r          A.37 utt3: right.  /
sv          A.37 utt4: There are so many other ways.  /
sd          A.37 utt5: {C But } that one, it just defeated me.  /
sd          A.37 utt6:  I didn't have any answer for that one.  /
sd          A.37 utt7:  That one was just beyond my imagination. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } [ that, + that ] just seems to be a person who just [ [ doesn't care about much of anything around, [ sort of, + {D you know, } doesn't, + doesn't, ] + ] sort of, ] likes rights probably, but doesn't like [ respon-, + responsibilities. ] /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  That's a good point,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: you're probably right. /  

sd(^q)          B.40 utt1:  {E I mean, } that's what it boils down to, is [ people like to, + people say, ] {F Oh, } I don't want to be on jury, {D you know, }  /

^q          B.40 utt4: I don't want to do this and that.  /
sd          B.40 utt5:  {D Well, } then they could, {D you know, } put them in the reverse situation, in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty  /

sd          A.43 utt1:  {C And } that was what I was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election,  /

b          B.44 utt1:  Yes. /
