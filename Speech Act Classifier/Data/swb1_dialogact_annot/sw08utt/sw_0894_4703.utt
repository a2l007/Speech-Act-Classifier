o          A.1 utt1:  <Clicking> Okay. /  

qw          B.2 utt1:  <Clicking> {D So, } what is your opinion [ on, + on ] drug testing? /  

sv          @A.3 utt1:  <TV> <noise> {D Well } I can see it in certain cases where [ it might be, + ] {F uh, } somebody's in a position that, {F uh, } perhaps a lot of lives are involved, like,  maybe, {F uh, } pilots that, {F uh, } {D you know, } fly jets  /
sv          @A.3 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people.  /
sv          @A.3 utt3: I could certainly see it being done  /
%          @A.3 utt4: {C but, } in general, {F uh, } {D you know, } - /
sd          @A.3 utt5: whether companies want to do this - /
sd          @A.3 utt6:  {C and } I know that companies do.  /
sd          @A.3 utt7:  Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested.  /
sd          @A.3 utt8: I know a couple of corporations that are doing that.  /
sv(^q)          @A.3 utt9:  {F Uh, } {C so, } {D you know, } they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab.  /
sv          @A.3 utt10:  {C But } there's got to be {D like } a limitation.  /
qh          @A.3 utt11:  Do we drug test everybody that comes in  /
qrr          @A.3 utt12: [ {C and } + {C or } ] do we kind of say, well you can be drug tested  /
^q          @A.3 utt13: {C and } you look okay because you look this way.  /
^q          @A.3 utt14: [  You're, + you're ] very conservative  /
^q          @A.3 utt15: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs  /
sv          @A.3 utt16: {C but } the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of, {F uh, } the conservative or whatever could be drug tested.  /
%          @A.3 utt17: {C And, } - /
%          @A.3 utt18:  {F uh, } {D you know, } whether legal rights [ and, + ] of that person, - /
h          @A.3 utt19: I don't know.  /
sv          @A.3 utt20: There's certainly a lot of things to really consider, {F uh, } when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless, of course, like I said, they have a large responsibility over a mass of people  /
sd          @A.3 utt21: # {F uh, } that's about it. # /  

b          B.4 utt1:  # {D Well, } yeah,  /

qy^d          B.4 utt3: you're talking about company's liability. /  

ny          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
ny^r          A.5 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          B.6 utt1: [ [ If, + if, ] + {F uh, } if ] the company is liable for something that, that, a employee does while under the influence [ of, + of ] a drug, {D you know, } then by all means they should have # the right [ [ [ [ to, + to, ] +  to, ] + <<pause>> to ] # -- +    

aa          A.7 utt1:  # Sure,  /
aa          A.7 utt2: sure.  /
sv          A.7 utt3: {C And } I think that's # what companies are doing,  {F uh, } more and  more because there are products that are out there. /  

+          B.8 utt1:  -- <Noise> to  ] minimize their liability.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {C And } there's also the case about just, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ health, + health ] and welfare of the, {F uh, } <swallowing> employees. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  If a company has a healthy work force, # their # --   

aa          A.11 utt1:  # Exactly. # /

aa          A.19 utt1:  # Exactly. # /

aa          A.21 utt1:  Exactly.  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  The only thing is, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.21 utt3: the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  If they have had {D like, } {F uh, } medications in the past, let's say, once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C and } the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked marijuana. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and } there's poppy seed type things.  /
sv          A.25 utt2:  I think that everybody is aware of that  /
qh          A.25 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } where's the line [ where you, + where you ] say to somebody, I'm going to drug test you tomorrow  /
^q          A.25 utt4: {C so } please do not take these medications  /
qh          A.25 utt5: {C or } where's, - /

b          B.28 utt1:  Right.  /
qh          B.28 utt2:  The question becomes what do you do about somebody [ who tests, + <<mispronounced>> who tests ] positive. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  Exactly. /  

%          B.30 utt1:  D-, - /
sv          B.30 utt2: that's where the real sticking point comes in. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.32 utt1:  It's not, - /
sv          B.32 utt2: I don't think there's any problem with testing people. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Sure. /  

qw          B.34 utt1:  It's what do you do with the information? /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Sure.  /
aa          A.35 utt2: Exactly.  /
%          A.35 utt3:  An-, - /
sv          A.35 utt4: {C and } [ th-, + the ] only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on.  /
sd          A.35 utt5:  Let's say, {F uh, } you've taken medication of some sort, even though they usually have you, at the time, list what medications you've taken.  /
sd          A.35 utt6:  {F Uh, } let's say you do come out positive  /
sd          A.35 utt7: {C and } you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there.  /
sd          A.35 utt8: {C Or } you've had a cold  /
sd          A.35 utt9: {C and } you've been on medication or whatever,  /
sd          A.35 utt10: you come out positive.  /
qh          A.35 utt11:  Is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well, {D you know, } this is kind of iffy, {D you know, }  /
^q          A.35 utt12: are they really on drugs  /
^q          A.35 utt13: [ {C or, } + {C or } ] they on drugs, - /
qy          A.35 utt14: you know what I'm saying.  /
qw          A.35 utt15: # Where # --   

b          B.36 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person, {F uh, } is on drugs  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C or } [ make up, + they may make up ] their mind that let's get rid of this employee,  /
qy          A.37 utt3: you know # what I'm # --   

b          B.38 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- saying? /  

ny          B.40 utt1:  {D Well, } yeah.  /
sv^e          B.40 utt2:  I think clearly, the person who is [ the line own-, + the line manager ]  -- -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  -- the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing.  /
sv          B.42 utt2: That should go to an entirely different, {F uh, } agency within a corporation. /  

aa          A.43 utt1:  Exactly. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  # {F Uh, } # /  

%          A.45 utt1:  # {C And } # it's a, - /
sd          A.45 utt2: they can that the, - /
sv          A.45 utt3: if it does come out positive the first time, they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take,  /
qy          A.45 utt4: you know what I mean?  /
sd          A.45 utt5: [  It, + it's ] kind of like, {F uh, } - /
