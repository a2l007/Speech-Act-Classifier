qy          A.1 utt1:  do you see as, {F uh, } the changes that have occurred in the last  ((   )) , - /
sd          A.1 utt2:  Beverly. /  

sv          B.2 utt1:  I think one of the thing that I notice a lot, - /
sd          B.2 utt2: I know it's touching social changes,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } to me what becomes socially acceptable, - /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } [ I, + I ] don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction,  /
sv          B.2 utt5: {C but } I notice things on T V being [ more, +  {F um, } open, more ] I believe, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.2 utt6: they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago,  /
sd          B.2 utt7: [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and  } ] specifically, nudity, things like that, {F uh, }  /
h          B.2 utt8: I don't know,  /
sv          B.2 utt9: [ I, + I've ] said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V  /
sv          B.2 utt10: {C and } nobody will think anything of it,  /
sv          B.2 utt11: {C and } to me that's surprising.  /
sv          B.2 utt12:  To me, [ that's, + that's ] a big change to accept it,  /
sv          B.2 utt13: {C and } it comes across, I think subtly, {D you know, } a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, {D you know, } when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much.  /
sd          B.2 utt14:  That's one of the biggest ones I've seen. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Huh,  /
aa          A.3 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          A.3 utt3: that's a big one. /  

qo          B.4 utt1:  What about you? /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions.  /
sv          A.5 utt2:  Somebody else, {F uh, } made them do it.  /
sv          A.5 utt3: {F Uh, } that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, {F uh, } no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices.  /
sv(^q)          A.5 utt4:  It's rather, sue these guys because they made [ a foo-, +  {F uh, } a ] seat belt that didn't work right  /
sv          A.5 utt5: {C or } --   

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- {F uh, } that's what I think is a big one. /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  I tend to agree with you,  /
sv          B.8 utt2: {C and } I think there's a lot of that.  /
%          B.8 utt3:  {F Um, } yeah,  /
sv          B.8 utt4: we have become lawsuit happy.  /
sv          B.8 utt5:  Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get.  /
sv(^q)          B.8 utt6:  Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, {F um, } {F oh, } {D you know, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] era we went through that was like, {D you know, } hey if it makes you happy, do it.  /
sv          B.8 utt7:  {D You know, } kind of like, disregard to others,  /
^q       B.8 utt8: do what makes you happy,  /
%          B.8 utt9: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] yes,  /
sv          B.8 utt10: we should take care of ourselves, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.8 utt11: {C and } we should see to our own lives,  but not to a total disregard of others.  /
h          B.8 utt12:  {F Um, } I don't know,  /
sv          B.8 utt13: I think it's come to that a lot.  /
sd          B.8 utt14:  I see it a lot in my daughter.  /
sd          B.8 utt15:  I have a four year old. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C And } hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through,  /
sd(^q)          B.10 utt2: {C but } whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that,  /
^q          B.10 utt3: you made me do this,  /
sd          B.10 utt4: {C and so } I try to tell her,  ((   )) , everything isn't always somebody else's fault.  /
sv          B.10 utt5:  {D You know, } you have to watch where you're going <laughter>,  /
sd          B.10 utt6: [ {C and } + --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- {C and so } ] it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her.  /
o@          B.12 utt2: {C So. }   

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.13 utt2: {C and, } another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, {F uh, } the roles that men and women play.  /
sd          A.13 utt3:  That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly. /  

+@          B.14 utt1:  I think you're right.  /
qr          B.14 utt2: {F Um, } in your opinion, good or bad, or both? /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {D Well, } both, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.15 utt2: there's some great things that, {F uh, } have come about with more equality,  /
sv          A.15 utt3: {C but } I think that also, - /
sv          A.15 utt4: I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:  I do too.  /
sv          B.16 utt2: I think part of that, - /
h          B.16 utt3: I don't know,  /
sv(^q)          B.16 utt4: I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling {D like, } in terms of their self [ confid-, + confidence, ] their self worth, {D you know, } I can do something,  /
^q          B.16 utt5: I can be somebody, {D you know, }  /
^q          B.16 utt6: if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too.  /
sv          B.16 utt7: {C And } I think that's good,  /
sv          B.16 utt8: {C but, } {F um, } [ I think when you push, + {D you know, } maybe I think when ] that was first trying come about with, {D you know, } what we know as the women's lib movement -- /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  -- I think it was too extreme.  /
sv          B.18 utt2:  {F Um, } I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.18 utt3: {C and } I think there's definite roles,  /
sv          B.18 utt4: {C and } I think, {D you know, } part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of [ [ the, + the, ] +  the ] social changes,  /
h          B.18 utt5: I don't know,  /
sv          B.18 utt6: the fact that, {F uh, } during their early changes where, {D you know, } women did [ come more, + [ speak, + maybe speak ] out, {A I was going to say, } come more ] out of themselves, - /
sv          B.18 utt7: {C but } speak out, - /
sv          B.18 utt8: I think a lot of men were threatened by that.  /
sv          B.18 utt9:  I think now less men are, {D you know, } because they're used to it,  /
sv          B.18 utt10: it's around them.  /
h          B.18 utt11:  {F Um, } {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sd          B.18 utt12: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't know why the families are breaking up.  /
sv          B.18 utt13:  I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work.  /
sd(^q)          B.18 utt14:  They go in and say, {D well, } hey, {D you know, } I'll stick with it while it's good,  /
^q          B.18 utt15: {C and then } I'll get out.  /
sv          B.18 utt16:  {C And } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment. /  

aa          A.19 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.19 utt2: I would agree with you.  /
%          A.19 utt3: {F Uh, } -/
