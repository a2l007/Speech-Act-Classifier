b          @A.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.3 utt1:  {D Well, } <laughter> I guess the, {F uh, } most interesting one that's, {F uh, } going on right now, from my perspective, is this, {F uh, } phenomena of, {F uh, } {F uh, } Ross Perot.  /
sd          B.3 utt2: {F Uh, } caught his interview last night with David Frost  /
sd          B.3 utt3: {C and } # it was # --   

b          A.4 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /

sd          B.5 utt2:  I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  {C But } the whole phenomena of him coming out of, {F uh, } literally nowhere and no party.  {F Uh, } at least, no apparent party support on either side <swallowing> # is # --   

b          A.8 utt1:  # Huh. # /  

+          B.9 utt1:  -- pretty interesting. /  

b          A.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          A.12 utt1:  I'm not kidding.  /
sd          A.12 utt2: [  When you, + when you ] said it, it was kind of like a surprise. /

aa          A.14 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv@          A.14 utt2:  I think mainly because I haven't been watching what's politically going on.

sd          A.16 utt4: {D like } now, the new house bill that went to Minnesota, {F uh, } being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota, I'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that, and that being passed. /  

b          B.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.18 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } as far as politics in the grander, {F uh, } part of it as if you want to look at, {F uh, } election type things, I'm not quite sure even if I'm going to vote.  /
sd          A.18 utt2:  {F Uh } --   

b          B.19 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /

sd(^q)          B.29 utt2: one of the common criticisms of Clinton is, {F uh, } gee, he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House. /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          B.31 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C and,  } ] up and to the point of, {F uh, } Perot being a serious candidate, it seems like [ that, + that ] was a requirement of being [ a, + a ] contender within the party is to have done all those things. /

sd          B.33 utt2: {C and } now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are, {D you know, } pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of # a whole nonpolitical arena. # /  

sd          A.34 utt1:  # He might be [ [ a, + a ] + ] one of those,  /
b          A.34 utt2: # sure.  /

sd          A.34 utt4: when you think of some of the best presidents we've had, in the past, have been people that have struggled to get to the top.  /

sv          A.36 utt2: {C and } it has been kind of, in the past, {F uh, } I don't know, maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics, they've had to have money. /  

b          B.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.38 utt1:  {C And } you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way. /

sd          A.40 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so } it makes the common person, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.40 utt2: not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent  /
sd          A.40 utt3: {C and } I don't know if we'll ever see that {D you know. }  Where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and, {F uh, } has, {F uh, } {D you know, } - /
sd          A.40 utt4: you think of Abraham Lincoln and, {D you know, } just the background of --
