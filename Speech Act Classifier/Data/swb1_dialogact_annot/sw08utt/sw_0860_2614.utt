ft          A.1 utt1:  {D Well } thanks for being home, {F uh, } on the weekend,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: [ I, + {F uh, } I'm ] actually working at night  /
sd^t          A.1 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } there very few people that are on the list for calls, {F uh, } on the weekends nights. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          B.2 utt2: yeah,  /

sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } sometimes I'm not,  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C but } if I am it's always fun to talk. /  

qy          A.3 utt1: [ Are, + are ] you part of the school system out there? /  

na          B.4 utt1:  I am, as a matter of fact.  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  I'm at, {F uh, } North Carolina State. /  

sd^t          A.5 utt1:  {F Uh, } the reason I said that because I've had about, {F uh, } three calls and my daughter had one, too, from different students out of North Carolina.  /
sv^t          A.5 utt2:  I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students, or whatever. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^t          B.6 utt2: I think I was the one who did that {D actually. } /  

bh          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh } is that ri-, - /
ba          A.7 utt2: great,  /
ba^r          A.7 utt3: great. /

bh          A.9 utt1:  {F Oh, } is that right?  /
ba          A.9 utt2: That's wonderful. /  

sd^t          B.10 utt1:  {C So, } [ I know, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I know ] about this project,  /
sd^t          B.10 utt2: {C so } I got my students to sign up  /
sv^t          B.10 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } apparently a number of them have been participating. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: I talked to one,  /
sd^t          A.11 utt3: we're not on the subject.  Of course,  /
sd^r          A.11 utt4: I talked to one,  /
sv^t          A.11 utt5:  I think he had a whole bunch of calls.  /
sd^t          A.11 utt6:  He had a roommate that had calls and everything. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd^t          A.13 utt1:  # He # had way more, twice as many calls as, as I've made, {F uh, }  /
%          A.13 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I'm, ] - /
sv          A.13 utt3:  of course, we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will, {F uh, } sell like gang [ books, + ] [ bu-, + busters, ] {D really. } /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Okay,  /
ad^t          A.15 utt2: you first on the subject,  /
qw          A.15 utt3: [ wha-, + what ] do you think, about Latin America? /  

^h          B.16 utt1:  {F Uh, } let's see,  /
sd^t        B.16 utt2: the subject is, Latin America. /  

b^m       A.17 utt1:  Latin America,  /
%          A.17 utt2: yeah. /  

h          @B.18 utt1:  I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that,  /
sd          @B.18 utt2: I {D actually } [ wa-, +  was ] planning a trip to Latin America  /
sd          @B.18 utt3: {C and } I got warned off by some people.  /
sd          @B.18 utt4:  They say Peru can't be traveled to  /
sv          @B.18 utt5: {C and } the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  {F Oh, } really.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  T I had a place,  /
h          A.19 utt3: I'm not too sure,  /
sd          A.19 utt4: I don't think they do anymore,  /
%          A.19 utt5:  down, - /
sv          A.19 utt6: I think it was Campinas,  /
h          A.19 utt7: I'm not sure  /
sd          A.19 utt8: {C and, } {F uh, } I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry, or whatever.  /
sd          A.19 utt9:  {C And } they had quite a few, {F uh, } locations,  /
sd          A.19 utt10: not quite a few, several, in Latin America.  /
sd          A.19 utt11:  I think the one in New Mexico is closed  /
sd          A.19 utt12: {C and } I think the one [ in, + in ] Brazil is closed,  /
sd          A.19 utt13: {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know why that is a problem down there  /
sv          A.19 utt14: {C and } I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too  /
%          A.19 utt15: {C and, } {F uh, } an - /
sd          A.19 utt16: some people say go to New York,  /
sd          A.19 utt17: {C but } [ I don't, + I don't ] have an answer to the crime rate.  /
sv          A.19 utt18:  It's sad.  /
sv          A.19 utt19:  That is a sad situation.  /
sd          A.19 utt20: [ I, + I'd ] like to go down to Mexico, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.19 utt21: {C and } I keep hearing that, {D you know, } the government [ and, + and ] the crime rates pretty high too,  /
sv          A.19 utt22: [ that, + that ] is sad.    

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  {F Uh, } not that we can, {F uh, } sell any great program we have with crime,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: {C but, } {F uh. }  I think, {F uh, } I'm kind of like you,  /
sd          A.21 utt3: I don't have any strong opinions on it.  /
sv          A.21 utt4:  I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with [ our, + our ] neighbors down there is that we don't have any.  /
%          A.21 utt5:  We have more, - /
%          A.21 utt6: I guess ties, - /
sd          A.21 utt7: we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything  /
sd          A.21 utt8: {C and } we don't really, aren't that close to everyone in South America.  /
sd          A.21 utt9:  I don't really know why though. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: [ I, + I ] don't understand it either, although [ I, + I ] think a lot of South Americans regard the United States [ as, + as ] bullying.  /
sv          B.22 utt3:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's certainly from a historical point of view, would be true. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> {E I mean } certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking, [ in, + in ] his wildest dreams from his neighbors. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Right.  /
b          A.25 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: I know that I saw in a book, - /
sd          A.25 utt4: I was reading a Spanish book, {F uh, } not that I read Spanish, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.25 utt5: I just, {D you know, } reading some Spanish words  /
sd          A.25 utt6: {C and } there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans.  /
sd          A.25 utt7:  They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.25 utt8: {C and } I guess that's true.  /
sv          A.25 utt9:  We don't think of any one else but oursel-, - /
sv          A.25 utt10: I guess, we're kind of, {F uh, } the smart asses in the world, I suppose, {F uh, } or of America anyway.  /
sv          A.25 utt11:  We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {D well } I think they're going to have, - /
sv          B.26 utt3: that's a tough row for <noise> them [ to, + to ] hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard, {F uh, } citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans. /  

^2          A.27 utt1:  # As Mexicans,  /
b          A.27 utt2: yes  /
%          A.27 utt3: [ that, + that, ] # -/  

sv          B.28 utt1:  # {C And } they can stand on # their heads if they want too, /  

x          A.29 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

sv          B.30 utt1:  # {C but } # I don't think that [ they're going, + they're going ] to change that,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: [ [ {C and, } +   

aa          A.31 utt1:  # No,  /
aa^r          A.31 utt2: no,  /
sd          A.31 utt3: I know. # /  

+          B.32 utt1:  # {C and, } ] + {C and  } ] {D really, } {E I # mean } North Americans I think [ are, + ] when you say that even, [ I thi-, + ] {E I mean, } I tend to think of Americans and Canadians.  /
sv          B.32 utt2: I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly speaking they are. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.33 utt2: no,  /
sv          A.33 utt3: {E I mean } they were saying that of us, that we're the North Americans and they're Americans,  /
%          A.33 utt4: [ they, + they, ] - /
sv          A.33 utt5: we always say we're Americans,  /
sv          A.33 utt6: {C and } [ they, + they ] want us to say we're the North Americans. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  # {F Oh, } I see <throat_clearing>. # /  

sv          A.35 utt1:  # We're not Americans,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: we're # North Americans  /
sv          A.35 utt3: {C and } they're South Americans,  /
%          A.35 utt4: yeah. /  

h          B.36 utt1:  I don't know. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  Whatever,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: [ I, + I ] don't want to make, - /
sd          A.37 utt3: I read it somewhere, though  /
sv          A.37 utt4: it's not my point,  I guess,  /
%          A.37 utt5: {C so } <laughter>. -/  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {D well } [ it's, + it's ] so interesting, [ I ju-, +  I just ] don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  No,  /
aa^r          A.39 utt2: no,  /
sv          A.39 utt3: [ they, + they ] were lucky enough to have some oil, [ what, + ] ten years ago, [ an, + ]  /
sv          A.39 utt4: {C and } [ they, + they ] blew all that, and borrowed [ enou-, + ] more money than they can pay back now  /
sv          A.39 utt5: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C so } ] they're not exactly business men.  /
sv          A.39 utt6:  I do think we should deal more with them.  /
sd          A.39 utt7: [  I don't, + I do ] have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.39 utt8: for the language, {D you know, } is very foolish. - /
sd          A.39 utt9: I'm [ relativ-, + relatively ] familiar with Texas school system  /
sd          A.39 utt10: {C and } we should teach Spanish at least in, {F uh, } grammar school, {D you know } four or five grades of it so  that we can speak Spanish.  /
sv          A.39 utt11:  I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.39 utt12: {C and } there are problems with, {D you know, } the wet back problem, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.39 utt13: for, everyone knows what we're talking about,  /
sv          A.39 utt14: whe-, say wet back problem. - /
sd          A.39 utt15: {C And then } we should somehow, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.39 utt16: {C and } I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, {F uh, } businesses, {F uh, } at the borders of both sides so that [ you can, +  you ] don't have this problem of them trying to come up here [ an, + ] [ to, + to ] get the jobs, {D you know, }  /
sv         A.39 utt17: there, there may be some organized way to do this. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.41 utt1: [ I, + I ] do feel for them, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.41 utt2: they are very envious of us,  or they wouldn't be coming up here, {D you know, } risking a lot.  /
sv          A.41 utt3:  Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.41 utt4: getting thrown back I guess is all that, {F uh, } happens. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv         A.43 utt1:  You probably don't see that.  /
%          A.43 utt2:  Where, - /
sv          A.43 utt3: we see it, {D you know, } once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Well } I grew up in Los Angeles. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          A.45 utt2: {D well } you [ see it, + saw it ] out there then, too. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C so } [ I, + I ] knew, {F uh, } the Hispanic part of L A pretty well. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  # {C And } # certainly, {D you know, } knew that problem,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: [ knew, + {D you know, } knew ] about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  # {C And, } # {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] pretty wild. /  

sv          A.51 utt1:  I think [ a, + a ] common factor to a lot of problems, [ both, + ] whether it be crime, [ if, + if ] you want to jump on that, is mostly, {F uh, } poverty.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } I think a lot of their problems is poverty.  /
sv          A.51 utt3:  If we could, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sv          A.51 utt4: the problems we have, [ yo-, + ] [ kno-, + ] in this country, [ is, + is ] a lot of it's poverty.  /
sv          A.51 utt5:  Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, [ I, + ] that's another story,  /
sd          A.51 utt6: {C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } it is sad.  /
sv          A.51 utt7: [  There, + there's ] so much down in all of South America, {F uh, } so much potential, {D you know, }  /
%          A.51 utt8: we're, - /
sd          A.51 utt9: T I, of course [ is, + is ] really pushing world markets in their products  /
sd          A.51 utt10: {C and } [ they're, + they're ] mostly [ in, + in ] Europe now  and, [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] the Orient, Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore, {F uh,  }  /
sd          A.51 utt11: they're in Taiwan and Japan  /
sd          A.51 utt12: {C and } [ they're, + they ] haven't had, [ what, + ] that much luck in South America  /
sd          A.51 utt13: {C and } there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  # {C And } # there's got to be trade.  /
sv          A.53 utt2:  I guess that's some of the answer, I guess is business, {F uh. }  {F Uh, }  /
sv          A.53 utt3: {C and } I try to be an optimist  and say, well [ that, + that's ] one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously [ is to, + is to ] get some business going between each other.  /
sv          A.53 utt4: {C And } [ we need, + we need ] to do more of that, {F uh, } somehow.   And encourage more business,   

b          B.54 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.55 utt1:  # between # us. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  They've got to have a lot of resources I would think.  An enormous amount [ of, + of ] {D well } potential that way.  /
