o          B.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

o          A.2 utt1:  All righty.  /
sv@          A.2 utt2:  I think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market.    

b          B.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          A.4 utt1:  And for several reasons.  /
sv          A.4 utt2:  Probably some of that is divorce  /
sv          A.4 utt3: {C and } some is they're more educated than they used to be I think. /  

b          B.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } I think sometimes, {F uh, } leaders in government they've become more, {F uh, } adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time. /  

b          B.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.8 utt1:  We have more women in government. /  

b          B.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ad          A.10 utt1:  <Lipsmack>  {C And, } now I'll let you say something <laughter>. /  

sd          B.11 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I probably a little bit older than you are,  /
^h          B.11 utt2: {C so } what I see, {F uh, } is, - /
sd          B.11 utt3: the change that I see the most [ is, + is ] that, {F uh, } women have [ much more, + ] many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I [ w-, + went ] to college.  /
sd          B.11 utt4: When I went to college <breathing> you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or  a secretary,  /
sd          B.11 utt5: [ {C or, } + {C but } ] there were very few women in business at that time.  /
sd          B.11 utt6:  A few,  /
sd          B.11 utt7:  {C but } they were the oddity.  /
o@          B.11 utt8:  {C And, }    

^2          A.12 utt1:  Very limited. /  

+@          B.13 utt1:  Yes.  /
^h          B.13 utt2:  {C And } now I see - /
sd          B.13 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I see for my daughter, which is wonderful <breathing> this, - /
sd          B.13 utt4: she's thirteen  /
sd          B.13 utt5: {C and } I see a whole <breathing> wonderful world out there that she can choose from, /  

b          A.14 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.15 utt1:  # so # many different jobs, which I think is terrific. /  

aa          A.16 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  {C Because } I'm a teacher  /
sd          B.17 utt2: {C and, } {E I mean, } I love teaching,  /
sd          B.17 utt3: {C but, } [ there, + I think there ] are a lot of other things I would have liked better. /  

b          A.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.19 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } not that I would give the career up because [ it's, + it's ] a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too, /  

b          A.20 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          B.21 utt1:  # {C and } # [ I n-, + I need ] the income. /  

b          A.22 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.23 utt1:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I think that's the reason why a lot of women [ have, + have ] started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must. /  

aa          A.24 utt1:  I think that's right. /  

%          B.25 utt1:  {F Uh, } you just, - /
sv          B.25 utt2: it's very difficult to get along on one income unless <breathing>,  {F uh, } the male, {F uh, } has an extraordinarily good job. /  

b          A.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.27 utt1:  {C And } <talking> especially men who teach school, they don't make that much money,  /
%          B.27 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] most all, - /
sv          B.27 utt3: they always {C either } have <breathing> - /
sv          B.27 utt4: they're {C either } moonlighting {C or } else [ their, + their ] wife works, too. /  

b          A.28 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.29 utt1:  {F Uh, } it's just an economic need now. /  

sv          A.30 utt1:  I really think women have so much more responsibility [ than, + ] {D you know, } as far as everything. /  

aa          B.31 utt1:  {F Oh, } definitely. /  

sd(^q)          A.32 utt1:  {C And, } like you said, {F uh, } [ one, + ] women today have so many, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.32 utt2: the average today of having [ a, + a ] single family, {D you know, } with the mother as the head,   

b          B.33 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.34 utt1:  # {D you # know, } it just really, {F uh, } so commonplace,   

aa          B.35 utt1:  # {F Oh, } yes,  /
aa          B.35 utt2: exactly. # /  

+          A.36 utt1:  # nowadays.  # /  

sd          B.37 utt1:  We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents  /
sd          B.37 utt2: {C and, }   

b          A.38 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.39 utt1:  # {F uh, } # the majority is, {F uh, } married couple with children,  /
sd          B.39 utt2: {C but } still there's a lot more than there used to be.  /
sv          B.39 utt3: {C And } {D see } you never picture yourself in a situation like this.  /
sd          B.39 utt4:  When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest of my life. /  

b          A.40 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.40 utt2: right. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } <breathing>  {C but } ] [ I'm all, + I'm ] really grateful that I went to college.  /
sd(^q)          B.41 utt2: My mother always said, {D you know, } get an education in case you need one, [ a-, + ] because my father died when we were, - /
sd          B.41 utt3: I have a twin sister  /
sd          B.41 utt4: {C and } we were eleven when he died  /
sd          B.41 utt5: {C and } she had a nursing degree, /

sd          B.43 utt2: {C But, } she said [ in j-, + ] you never know what's going to happen  /
sd          B.43 utt3: {C and } I thank God that I did go to college <breathing> and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children. /  

sd          A.44 utt1:  {D You know, } isn't that funny, {F uh, } because the same thing happened to us, except I was twelve.   /
sd          A.44 utt2: {C And } my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession, /  

qh          B.45 utt1:  # Isn't that something.  # /

sv          A.50 utt2: {C and } even today I think the chance for education [ [  is + [ j-, + ] is, ] + is ] so much, {F uh, } better for all of our girls,   

aa          B.51 utt1:  # {F Oh, } yes.  # /

aa          B.53 utt2: I do, too.  /
sv          B.53 utt3:  {C But } I think it needs to continue to change  /
sv          B.53 utt4: {C and } [ I m-, + I ] think [ it, + ] there's still not equality as far as, {F uh, } paychecks for men and  women.  /
sv          B.53 utt5: I think that [ the, + ] we still have a long way to go. /  

^2          A.54 utt1:  A lot of things,  /

aa          B.55 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.55 utt2:  {C And } [ I think that, + {F uh, } I think ] by the year two thousand it, we're going to see [ some, + ] a lot more changes, {F uh, } hopefully, that women are, {D you know, } able to get [ the, + the ] executive jobs,   

b          A.56 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          B.57 utt1:  # and # hold positions that [ men, + <breathing>  men ] do because they can do it just as well, {D you know, }  /

b          A.58 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.58 utt2:  {C And } I also think that in the future that, {F uh, } it's going to continue.  /
sv          A.58 utt3: We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force. /

sv          A.60 utt1:  I think they're going to stay there  /
sv(^q)          A.60 utt2: {C and } I think that they're going to, {F uh, } {F uh, } be really responsible [ and, + and ] do everything just like, what you said, {D you know, } [ make, + make ] [ it + ] the grade [ and, + and ] make it so women can be the top people [ in their, +

sv          B.63 utt3: I think it <breathing>, -/  

aa          A.64 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think so. /  

sv          B.65 utt1:  {E I mean, } not that [ I, + I ] think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, <breathing>  could never do strength wise and so  forth -- /  

b          A.66 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.67 utt1:  -- {C but, } also there's some things women can do <laughter>  like have children,

aa          A.72 utt1:  Exactly. /
