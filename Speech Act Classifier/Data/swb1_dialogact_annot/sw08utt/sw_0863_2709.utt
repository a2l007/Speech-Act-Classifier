sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I'll tell you why I feel so, - /
sd^t          B.2 utt2: I feel strongly about this topic.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: I don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws.  /
sd          B.2 utt4:  {C But } I do know that in the, where I live and I teach school, there are so many Orientals that have come here  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C and } there's a lot of Mexican people too.  Which is not, neither here nor there,  /
sv          B.2 utt6: {C but } the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent, {F uh, } very wise in money matters and [ have ta-, + have taken ] over a lot of businesses, <laughter>  /
%          B.2 utt7: {C and } have, - /
%          B.2 utt8: <child_talking> {D Really, } ki-, - /
sv          B.2 utt9: it's kind of scary because they're so bright.  /
sv          B.2 utt10: [ They're, + ] all the kids that I have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids.  /
%          B.2 utt11:  {C And } they, - /
sv          B.2 utt12: {C and } [ the, + the ] parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up.  /
sv          B.2 utt13:  {C And } money is their main goal.  /
sv          B.2 utt14:  {C And } [ it's k-, + it ] really is kind of scary <laughter> because [ there's, + there's ] just oodles of them.  /
sv          B.2 utt15:  {C And } you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals.  /
sv          B.2 utt16: {C And } [ it's k-, + it's kind ] of scares me, not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact [ that, + {D you know, } that ] they have rights too.  /
sv          B.2 utt17:  {C But } <sigh> on the other hand, you feel like almost [ they're, + they're ] invading us to the point where they're going to take over </Child>. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Right.  /
sd(^q)          A.3 utt2:  {D Actually } my son once said [ that, + that, ] perhaps, {F uh, } what we should do [ is, + is ] buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] that might be the solution <laughter>. /  

aa          B.4 utt1:  I think probably that's,   

x          A.5 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+@          B.6 utt1:  a good idea.    

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.8 utt1:  Because I lived in Iowa [ for, + for ] about <child_talking> ten years before I came here.  /

b          A.9 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /

sd          B.10 utt2: {C and } [ there is, + there are ] a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.12 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] they are wonderful people  /
sd          B.12 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I'm not, + <child> {D you know, } I don't ] want to deny them their rights.  /
sv          B.12 utt3: Just that you, you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked [ re-, + ] very hard to make this country what it is, {F uh, } it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over.  /
sv          B.12 utt4:  {C And } a lot of these people plan one day to go back, {D you know, } [ to, + to ] Vietnam or to, {D you know, } Taiwan or wherever they're from.  And take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American [ [ com-, + com-, ] + companies. ]  /
sv          B.12 utt5: {C And } it's kind of scary <Laughter>. /

b          B.16 utt1:  # Oh. # /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- # do # believe there must have been some sort of quota system because, {F uh, } <lipsmack> I know a lot of people that [ were, + in a sense,  [ not, + ]  {A qualified is the wrong word, }  [ but + ] certainly were ] deserving to come. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  # {C And } #  it seemed to take them a long time  /
sd          A.19 utt2: [ {C or, } + {C or } ] there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come <lipsmack>. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  <Lipsmack>  {C And so } I would guess that, {D you know, } there are quotas for different places. /  

aa          B.22 utt1:  I would think so too.  /
%          B.22 utt2:  It, -/  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think there's something about being able [ to, + to ] claim, {F um, } imminent danger  /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C or, } I'm not sure what the terminology is. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.24 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  Maybe political a-, -/

aa          A.27 utt3: You got the term. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {C And } maybe that's [ a, + an ] issue with [ a, + a ] lot of people.  /
h          A.29 utt2:  I don't know.  /
o@          A.29 utt3: # {C But, } #

+@          A.31 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: [ I, + I ] guess I haven't been in a situation where [ it's, + it's ] been threatening [ to, + to ] me.  {F Uh, } /  

+@          B.32 utt1:  {D Well, } I teach in the suburb of Dallas  /
sd          B.32 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas.  [ And, + ] with very, very good school systems.  /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C And } they're considered, {D you know } one of the top three in the state.  Both of them, {D you know. } /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C And } it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C And } they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here.  /
sd          B.36 utt2:  {C And } the kids in this area are very bright. And come from, {D you know, } parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } very interested in their education.  /
sv          B.36 utt3: {C But, } {F uh, } I think in the, last year, [ I'm not, + if I'm not ] mistaken, in four of the six high schools, the graduating class valedictorian and  salutatorian were, {F uh, } [ alm-, + ] half or more Oriental. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.37 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } they're just extremely bright kids.  /
sd          B.38 utt2:  {C And } also they value learning. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  I was going to say, [ I'm not s-, + ] [ I, + I ] would guess that it's not that they are any brighter,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C but } they just maybe work harder  /
%          A.39 utt3: {C or, } -/  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] think things come easy for them too.  /
sv          B.40 utt2:  {C But } I do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States.  /
sv          B.40 utt3: [  I  don't, + they,    {F uh, } don't ] want to work for anything.  /
sv          B.40 utt4:  They want it to come to them  [ but + and ] be there  /
sv          B.40 utt5: {C but } they don't want to work hard.  /
sd          B.40 utt6: {C And } these kids work really hard. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right,  /

sv          A.43 utt1:  {C but } maybe part of that's the problem that here [ we've, + we've ] let this value slip. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa          B.44 utt2:  I know,  /
aa          B.44 utt3: I agree with that. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  {C And } they need to have some competition. /  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {C But } what I see is y-, - /
sd          B.46 utt2: the competition is there,  /
sv          B.46 utt3: {C but } instead of meeting the challenge, they're starting to resent them. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {C And } it's causing, {D you know, } I think [ some, + some ] problems. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  {D Well, } that's too bad. /  

aa@          B.50 utt1:  It really is.    

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.52 utt1:  Because we see a lot of racial problems in [ Dal-, + the Dallas ] area anyway,   

b          A.53 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+@          B.54 utt1:  # especially # in Dallas.  /

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.55 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ there is some, + there has been some ] resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there,  /
sv          B.56 utt2: {C and } the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money,  /
sd          B.56 utt3: {C and } there's been some violence because of it. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's really sad. /  

aa          B.58 utt1:  It is.  /
