b          A.7 utt1:  Oh. /  

qr          B.8 utt1:  Did you see those because of, {F uh, } Julia Roberts, or <breathing> for, {F uh, }  the subject matter of the two? /

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          B.20 utt3: {D well, } it really wasn't on a theme that I was, {F uh, } {F uh, }  that into,  /
sd          B.20 utt4: {C or, } as I say, [ th-, + ] I prefer the light movies that, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.20 utt5: my style of entertainment [ is, + is ] comedy, {F uh, } primarily --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh -- /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- and then into action films. /

br          B.24 utt1:  What? /  

sd^r          A.25 utt1:  I didn't really care for the movie either. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: you kind of have to like to be, {F uh, } drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.27 utt2: uh-huh.  /
b          A.27 utt3:  {D Well, } okay,  /
qy          A.27 utt4: on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN? /  

ny          B.28 utt1:  {F Uh, } yes. /  

qy          A.29 utt1:  Do you enjoy that one? /  

na          B.30 utt1:  {F Uh, } it was interesting,  /
sv@          B.30 utt2: {C but } I felt that one was a bit farfetched.    

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.32 utt1:  {F Uh, } in that,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: {D well, } I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, {F um, } DEFENDING YOUR LIFE. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {F Oh, } I haven't even heard of that one. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {D Well, } that was one where, {F uh, } - /
%          B.34 utt2: it's kind of like, - /
sv          B.34 utt3: to me it's somewhat like  PRETTY WOMAN.  /
sd          B.34 utt4: [  The, + the ] story line, {F um, } - /
sd          B.34 utt5: if you accept a few of the basic starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.  /
sd          B.34 utt6:  {F Uh, } it was hard to accept that, {F uh, } this, {F uh, } multimillionaire wheeler dealer [ would, + {F uh, }  would, ] {D you know, } find himself and allow himself to get into that situation. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
%          A.35 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.35 utt3:  {D Well, } I really liked PRETTY WOMAN.  /
%          A.35 utt4:  {D You know, } I just, - /
sd          A.35 utt5: {D well, } you just kind of went with it.  /
sd          A.35 utt6:  Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.36 utt2:  It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  {C But, } {F um, } FLATLINERS, {D now, } it's a drama,  /
sd          A.37 utt3: {C and } I don't usually like  them,  /
sd          A.37 utt4: {C and } I really enjoyed it.  /
h          A.37 utt5: [ I, + {F um, } I ] don't know,  /
%          A.37 utt6: it was kind of, - /
sv          A.37 utt7: it made you think a lot --   

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- I think.  /
qy          A.39 utt2:  Did you see GHOST? /  

ny          B.40 utt1:  Yes. /  

bk          A.41 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy          A.41 utt2: {D now, } did you care for that one? /  

%          B.42 utt1:  {F Uh, } that was, - /
na          B.42 utt2: I enjoyed that one.  /
sd          B.42 utt3:  [  I, +  [ in that I, + ]   I ] guess  [ I, +  I ] hate to be too surprised in a movie,  /
sd          B.42 utt4: {C and } in that one [ you could, + you could ] pretty well guess where it was,   

x          A.43 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.44 utt1:  going to end up.  /
sv          B.44 utt2:  You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,  /
sv          B.44 utt3: {C but } you knew where it would end up. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          A.45 utt2:  {D See, } {D now, } I didn't, - /
sv          A.45 utt3: I thought it was an okay movie,  /
sd          A.45 utt4: {C but } it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  I didn't think so, {F um, }  /
sd          A.47 utt2: I really didn't care for the ending of it.  /
sv          A.47 utt3:  I thought it was just of like <laughter> you didn't know this was going to happen,  /
%          A.47 utt4: when, {D you know, } - /
h          A.47 utt5: {C but, } {F um, } I don't know, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.47 utt6:  {D Well, } of course, {F uh, } a bunch of girls had told me and warned me,  /
sd(^q)          A.47 utt7: {C and } they said, {F "Oh, } it's a real tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da.  /
sd          A.47 utt8:  Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and  said {D well, } [ when are you, + when are you ] supposed to start crying, {D you know } <laughter>. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.49 utt1: [  I didn't really, +   

sd          B.50 utt1:  {D Well, } whenever she starts crying <laughter>. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  {F Uh, } I didn't really ] find it to be a tearjerker <laughter>. /  

qy          B.52 utt1:  {D Well, } do you go to many movies more than once? /  

na          A.53 utt1:  {F Um, } if I see them more than once, I see them on video.  /
sd@          A.53 utt2:  I never pay to see one more than once.    

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          A.55 utt1:  {D You know. }  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C But } like you said, [ I, + I ] enjoy the comedies a lot better.  /
sd          A.55 utt3: In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          B.56 utt2:  {D Well, } these days it's, {F uh, } -/  

sv          A.57 utt1:  You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {D Well, } [ if you don't, +  with some of the movies, if you don't ] go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, {F uh, } left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.60 utt1:  {C So, } {F uh, } unless a movie is popular and stays around, {F uh, } you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.61 utt2: uh-huh. /  

%          B.62 utt1:  {C So } we have, {F um, } - /
sv          B.62 utt2: {D well, } I think just most people have V C R -s now  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C and } we probably watch twice as many movies at home --   

b          A.63 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.64 utt1:  -- as we do at movie theaters. /

nn          A.65 utt2:  No,  /
sd^e          A.65 utt3: I saw one, it was a drama also,  /
sd          A.65 utt4: {C and } I can't think of the name of it now, that, {F um, } - /
sd          A.65 utt5: it was a book before it came out in a movie,  /
sd          A.65 utt6: {C and } [ it was, + [ it w-, + ] it was ] a drama.  /
sd@          A.65 utt7:  It wasn't a comedy.  {F Uh, }    

qy          B.66 utt1:  Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES? /  

+@          A.67 utt1:  No.  /

sd          A.67 utt3:  I didn't get to. /  

sd          B.68 utt1: [ I, + at least what I ] hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time [ in a, + in a ] longer version --   

bh          A.69 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- even though it was a long movie.  /
sd          B.70 utt2: It's sort of the uncut version.  /
h          B.70 utt3:  At least that was some of the rumors.  /
sd          B.70 utt4: We'll have to see, because [ it's, + ] {F uh, } there was some talk about that.  /
%          B.70 utt5: I, - /
sd          B.70 utt6: maybe it will come out this fall.  /
%          B.70 utt7: There, - /
sd          B.70 utt8: we're sort of in the middle of the summer, {F um, } season of a lot of new movies coming out,  /
sv          B.70 utt9: {C but } then there's these, {F um, } periods like early fall before Christmas or  early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again, it, {F uh, } will increase the revenues from the movie. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qw          A.71 utt2:  {D Well, } {F um, } what movies are showing down there now? /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ I, + I'd ] actually have to get a newspaper out.  /
sd          B.72 utt2:  My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.72 utt3: I keep track of them a little,  /
sd          B.72 utt4: {C but, } {D you know, } ask me to name the ten that are out there right now,  /
sd          B.72 utt5: {C and } I'd have to say, {F uh, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] don't know.  /
sd          B.72 utt6: [ I, + I ] just look at the newspaper before I decide to go  /
