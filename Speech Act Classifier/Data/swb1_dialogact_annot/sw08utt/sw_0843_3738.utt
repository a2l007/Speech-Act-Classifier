o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy^t          A.1 utt2: you ready to discuss [ the, + the ] topic? /  

qw^t          B.2 utt1:  What's the topic? /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd^t          A.3 utt2: the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and  how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or  thirty years ago. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Okay. /  

qy^t          A.5 utt1:  You ready for that? /  

na          B.6 utt1:  You bet. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Okay <beep>. /  

cc          B.8 utt1:  I'll let you lead out. /  

br          A.9 utt1:  Pardon me? /  

cc^r          B.10 utt1:  I'll let you lead out. /  

aa          @A.11 utt1:  Okay,  /
%          @A.11 utt2: <laughter> {D well, } there's, {F uh, } - /
sd^t          @A.11 utt3: it's kind of an interesting topic  /
sv          @A.11 utt4: {C and } one that I think is quite fascinating because, {F uh, } couple of years ago, I guess, {F uh, } - /
sv          @A.11 utt5: [ not very, + not very ] long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, {F uh, } {D you know, } a very comfortable position, so to say, even though [ the, + the ] cold war [ was, + was ] in full swing.  {D You know, }  /
sd          @A.11 utt6: you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World,  /
sd         @A.11 utt7: {C and } in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, {F uh, } couple of years ago [ we had, + ] {F uh, } America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned,  /
sd          @A.11 utt8: {C and } now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period.  /
sd          @A.11 utt9:  We're also have a very humongous trade deficit,  /
sv          @A.11 utt10: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] that's kind of frightening.  /
sv          @A.11 utt11:  Also, {D you know, } a couple of years ago, [ ten, [ fif-, + fifteen, ] + ten, fifteen ] years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life,  /
sd          @A.11 utt12: {C and } thirty years ago, [ that was, + that was ] basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change [ every, +  {D you know, } every couple of years and possibly [ fi-, +  four to five ] career changes throughout our lifetime,  /
%          @A.11 utt13: {C and so } I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } things, - /
sv          @A.11 utt14: there's been an awful lot of social <printer> change lately,  /
%          @A.11 utt15: {C and } we-, - /
%          @A.11 utt16: {C and, } {F uh. } -/  

sv          B.12 utt1:  <Printer> I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes --   

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- <Printer> is that [ the, + ] [ they seem to be social, + they seem to be economically ] driven also. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  <Printer> {C So } if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {C And, } of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now.  /
qh          B.16 utt3:  One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  True. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, {E I mean, } I think it's great to even have three or four different careers --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- in your life.  /
sv          B.20 utt2:  I think it must have been terribly boring to # go through, #   

x          A.21 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

+          B.22 utt1:  your life <laughter> doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years. /  

aa          A.23 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa^r          A.23 utt2: yes. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact [ that, + that ] aspects changing. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  True,  /
aa^r          A.25 utt2: true. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C And } the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {C but, } the fact that you really can make major changes in your life --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- and jobs. -/  

qr          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } [ do, + do ] you think that's good or bad? /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  I think it's great. /  

b^m          A.31 utt1:  You think that's great. /  

aa          B.32 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

%          A.33 utt1:  That's some, - /
%          A.33 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          A.33 utt3: because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position,  /
sv          A.33 utt4: [ they, + they're ] very comfortable,  /
sv          A.33 utt5: they lose the ability to learn,  /
sv          A.33 utt6: {C and } they in a sense become unteachable.  /
sv          A.33 utt7:  They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path,  and {D you know, } <printer> come in and put my time in from nine to five,  /
sv          A.33 utt8: {C and } when that's over with, [ that's, + that's ] it, without even giving a second thought to  ((   )) , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, {F um, } education,  /
sv          A.33 utt9: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  I think one of the problems [ with, + with ] education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. /  

x          A.35 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.36 utt1:  It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession --   

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.38 utt1:  -- <Printer> and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing [ for, + for ] people to face. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  <Printer> Right.  /
aa          A.39 utt2:  I agree with that,  /
aa^r          A.39 utt3: I agree with that.  /
sv          A.39 utt4:  {C But } I believe that, {F uh, } an individual should really learn how [ to, + to ] learn -- /  

b          B.40 utt1:  <Printer>  Yeah. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  -- <Printer> learn how to adapt,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: learn how to grow [ in the, + in ] their college or whatever education they might take.  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {D Well, } [ that, + that's ] good,  /
sd^r          A.41 utt4: that's good. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  There probably needs to be some training on how [ [ to, + to, ] + to ] adjust to these changes as they # come about. # /  

x          A.43 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

sv          B.44 utt1:  {E I mean } if you look at [ the, + the ] high unemployment rate right now  /
sv          B.44 utt2: {C and } </printer> you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes # now. # /  

b          A.45 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {C So } it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: [ I, + I ] read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications <talking> where stress, {F uh, } for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and  threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place  /
%          A.49 utt2: {C and } it affects, -/
