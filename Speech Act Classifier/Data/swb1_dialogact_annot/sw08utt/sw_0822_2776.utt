o          B.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

ba          A.2 utt1:  Great.  /
sd          A.2 utt2: {F Um, } currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program. /  

b          B.3 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.4 utt1:  I'm mainly do a lot of walking.  /
sd          A.4 utt2: I have a son that's a little bit overweight  /
sd          A.4 utt3: {C and, } {F um, } the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.  /
sd          A.4 utt4: {C So } my wife and I kind of take turns.  /
sd          A.4 utt5:  At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program.  /
sd          A.4 utt6:  {C But, } in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.  /
sd          A.4 utt7:  All this space that normally would be dedicated <laughter> towards the,   

b          B.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.6 utt1:  exercise area, is covered in boxes. /  

qw          B.7 utt1:  {F Um, } what did you do when you did exercise regularly? /  

sd          A.8 utt1:  {D Well, } I had, {F uh, } a little routine that I did for warm ups. /  

b          B.9 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.10 utt1:  {C And then } I did some very mild, {D say, } light weight lifting.  /
sd          A.10 utt2:  Nothing, - /
sd          A.10 utt3: I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,   

b          B.11 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.12 utt1:  just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age <laughter>. /  

b          B.13 utt1:  Yeah  /
sd          B.13 utt2: <laughter>.  {F Um, } right now, {F um, } I try when it's nice out,  /
sd          B.13 utt3: it's been raining a lot this spring,  /
sd          B.13 utt4: {C but } I try to, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.13 utt5: I have a bicycle  /
sd          B.13 utt6: {C and } I like to cycle a lot.  /
sd          B.13 utt7:  {C And, } {F uh, } my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,  /
sd        B.13 utt8: I don't know,   

b          A.14 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.15 utt1:  if it's up north,  /
sd          B.15 utt2: {C but } every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally  /
sd          B.15 utt3: {C and } thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun. /  

b          A.16 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  {F Um, } {C so } we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.  /
sd          B.17 utt2: {C And, } {F um, } T I, where I work has, {F uh, } a fitness center  /
sd          B.17 utt3: {C so } a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,  /
sd          B.17 utt4: {C and, } {F um, } they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on.  /
sd          B.17 utt5: {C So } I try to, - /
sd          B.17 utt6: I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.  /
sd          B.17 utt7:  I used to, {F uh, } get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,  /
sd          B.17 utt8: {C so } I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,  /
sv          B.17 utt9: {C but } it's a big commitment.  /
sd          B.17 utt10: We don't have any kids yet  /
sd          B.17 utt11: {C so, } that's a [ lot of, +  part ] of it. /  

b          A.18 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.18 utt2:  That's a plus.  /
sd          A.18 utt3: {F Oh, } I have a total of five children.  /
sd          A.18 utt4:  I have three left living at home. /  

b          B.19 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.20 utt1:  {C And } they do take up a big part of [ my, + {F uh, } my ] evening and weekend. /  

b          B.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.22 utt1:  {C And } it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too. /  

b          B.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.24 utt1:  It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.  /
aa          A.24 utt2:   ((  Yes, ))  /
sv          A.24 utt3: when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children. /  

b          B.25 utt1:  Huh-uh <laughter>. /  

x          A.26 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.27 utt1:  That's why, [ they, {F uh, } really stress, + at T I, they really stress, ] staying in shape, {D like } stay in [ fit, + ] overall fitness, {D you know, } no smoking and all that.  /
sd          B.27 utt2: {C But } it's hard to find, {F uh, } an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, {D you know, } because {D like } I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes  /
sd          B.27 utt3: {C and } I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.  /
sv          B.27 utt4:  {C But } it's really hard to find something that works, and, {D you know, } to find time to do it and  stay committed to it {D like } three days a week or whatever.  /
sv          B.27 utt5:  I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and  much money or whatever. /  

b          A.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.30 utt1:  You have to, - /
sv          A.30 utt2: what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself. /  

b          B.31 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          A.32 utt1:  {C And } you can use what ever rationale you want,  /
sv          A.32 utt2: {C but } basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live. /  

aa          B.33 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.34 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, {D well, } then I'll around a lot longer, /  

x          B.35 utt1:  <Laughter>   

sv          A.36 utt1:  {C And } those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, {D well, } {D you know, } get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it. /  

b          B.37 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          A.38 utt1:  If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine. /  

b          B.39 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.39 utt2:  {F Um, } I've been learning a lot lately about, {F um, } - /
sd          B.39 utt3: I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper,  /
qy^d          B.39 utt4: I don't know if you're familiar with him -- /  

b          A.40 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:  -- he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health {D really. }  /
sd          B.41 utt2: [ [ He's, + he's, kind of, ] + he's ] pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.  /
sd*          B.41 utt3:  {F Um, } he was talking about the three things [ you could, + ] that cause aging smoking are inactivity,  / *[[ mistranscribed? listen]]
sd          B.41 utt4: {C and } what was the other one, I think was,  {D yeah, }  obesity.  /
sd          B.41 utt5:  If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, {D you know, } cause those are risk factors,  /
sd          B.41 utt6: {D so } {D anyway, }   

b          A.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.43 utt1:  it's kind of a tip. /  

sd          A.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } I've done a lot of study over the years  /
sd          A.44 utt2: {C and } I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water. /  

b          B.45 utt1:  Really <laughter>. /  

b          A.46 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.46 utt2:  {F Um, } the research that I've done - /
sd          A.46 utt3: {C and } I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three. /  

b          B.47 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.48 utt1:  {C And, } it's amazing, that, {F uh, } {D you know, } prior to {D like } nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks. /  

b          B.49 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.50 utt1:  There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.  /
sd          A.50 utt2:  {D Well, } in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water.   In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,  /
sd          A.50 utt3: {C and } after that [ we, +   

x          B.51 utt1:   ((   )) .   

+          A.52 utt1:  we ] started having the hearts attacks  /
sd          A.52 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.  /
sd          A.52 utt3: You can usually find it in a health food store. /  

b          B.53 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.54 utt1:  I know they had it in health food stores in Plano,  /
sd          A.54 utt2: I used live in Plano. /  

br          B.55 utt1:  Dr. Price? /  

sd^r          A.56 utt1:  {F Uh, } Dr. Price,  /
%          A.56 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.56 utt3:  {C And } it's amazing,  /
sd          A.56 utt4: he makes the, - /
sd          A.56 utt5: {D you know, } it's a very small book  /
sd          A.56 utt6: {C and } the guys very opinionated,  /
sd          A.56 utt7: {F um, } {C but } he makes a very good case against chlorine.  /
sd          A.56 utt8: There were no heart attacks before we started using it  /
sd          A.56 utt9: {C and } he points out that people in, {F uh, } England - /
sd          A.56 utt10: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C or } ] even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now, /  

b@          B.57 utt1:  Huh-uh.   

sd          A.58 utt1:  {C and } they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks. /  

+@          B.59 utt1:  That's really interesting. /  

b          A.60 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.60 utt2:  He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.    

b          B.61 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.62 utt1:  And, {F uh, } proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,   

b          B.63 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.64 utt1:  clogging of the arteries.  /
%          A.64 utt2:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } he's, - /
sd          A.64 utt3: there's been a lot of reports since then.  /
sd          A.64 utt4: This whole thing about, - /
sd          A.64 utt5: first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,  /
sd          A.64 utt6: {C and } now they're saying what's cholesterol,  /
sd          A.64 utt7: {D well } there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol. /  

b          B.65 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.66 utt1:  {D You know, } it's amazing what he points out in that book  /
sd          A.66 utt2: {C and, } in fact, [ he, + ]   everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven.  {C And } in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.  /
sd          A.66 utt3: {C And, } E P A never published that report. /  

qw          B.67 utt1:  {C And } what's the name of this book again? /  

sd^r          A.68 utt1:  CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE. /  

sd          B.69 utt1:  I'll have to remember that. /  

b          A.70 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.71 utt1:  That will be very interesting.  /
sd          B.71 utt2:  My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon  /
sd          B.71 utt3: {C so, } he's really interested in the heart. /  

b          A.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.73 utt1:  {C And } [ he's, + in fact, he's ] a, {D well, } heart, too, - /
sd         B.73 utt2: [ he's, + {F uh, } he's ] done a lot of research on {D like } how your heart reacts to exercise <laughter>.  /
fa          B.73 utt3:  Sorry,  /
sd          B.73 utt4: he made me laugh.  /
%          B.73 utt5: {F Um, } {D so } {D anyway, } -/  

b          A.74 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.74 utt2: [ There is, + there is ] a lot of good information out there, {F uh, } about health.  /
sv          A.74 utt3: {C And } [ a lot of the, + a lot of the ] myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true. /  

b          B.75 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.76 utt1:  {E I mean, } I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because [ that's, + that's ] good for you, /  

b          B.77 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.78 utt1:  {F uh, } {C but } to believe some of the things, - /
sd          A.78 utt2: {D you know, } {C and } I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,  /
sv          A.78 utt3: {C but } to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis [ is, + is ] just hard to believe. /  

sd          B.79 utt1:  If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol. /  

b          A.80 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          B.81 utt1:  That's a real good,  /
sd          B.81 utt2: {F um, } he talks about that.  /
sd          B.81 utt3:  Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that. /  

b          A.82 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.82 utt2:  I actually eat pretty much anything that I want. /  

b          B.83 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.84 utt1:  {C And } I've had my cholesterol checked [ and, + ] {F uh, } a few times  /

+          A.86 utt1:  never.  /

sv          A.90 utt3: {D You know, } they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued. /  

b          B.91 utt1:  Yeah. /

ba          B.95 utt1:  That's good. /  

sd          A.96 utt1:  {D You know, } I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,  /
sd          A.96 utt2: {C but } I do eat, {D you know, } some health cookies that are high in fiber,
