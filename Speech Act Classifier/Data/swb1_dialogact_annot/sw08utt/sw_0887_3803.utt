fp          A.1 utt1:  Hi.  /
qw          A.1 utt2:  What do you think about gun control? /  

sd          @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess, {F uh, } {F uh, }  /
sv          @B.2 utt2: [ [ I, + I [ s-, + ] ] + I ] lean more towards the control side [  than, +  than ] towards, {D you know, } just [ the, + the ] [ free, + free ] army.  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: {F Uh, } on the other hand [ I, + ] [ it's, + it's ] sort of an issue [ of, + of ] {F uh, } - /
sd          @B.2 utt4: [ I'm not, + I'm not ] a great fan [ of, + of ] government control in general  /
sd          @B.2 utt5: {C and so }  [ it's, + it's ] kind of a tough issue.  /
qo          @B.2 utt6:  What about yourself? /  

sv          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess that I would like [ to, + to ] say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or, {F uh, } have a legitimate use for [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] weapon I suppose --   

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  -- because also, living in this area, [ the, + the ] problems in D C come home very quickly. /  

ba          B.6 utt1: [ I'm, + I'm ] sure,  /
%          B.6 utt2: yeah.  /
qy^d          B.6 utt3:  {F Uh, } {C so } you would take a position where somebody [ without, + without ] a, {F uh, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> specific use, - /
qy          B.6 utt4: in other words, if they just wanted to have [ a, + a ] gun to have in their home, {F uh, } [ you wouldn't, + you wouldn't ] like them to be able to do that?  /
qy          B.6 utt5: Is that, -/  

no       A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } I'm not so sure about that,  /
sv          A.7 utt2: {C but } I think somehow, {F uh, } safety courses - /
sd          A.7 utt3:  {C or, } I don't know whether this could be something that was done in school,  /
%          A.7 utt4: {C but } somehow people, - /
sv          A.7 utt5: I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were, whether they followed them or not.  /
sv@          A.7 utt6:  {D You know, } at least there's the moral issue that  [ they, +  they ] knew better.    

o@          B.8 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Uh, }   

+@          A.9 utt1:  Which is sort of, {D you know, } flaky,  /
%          A.9 utt2: {C but } still, -/  

+@          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.10 utt2: [ [ I, + I ] have, + {F uh, } I   have  ] the impression [ that, + that ] [ the, + the ] majority of the problems that we have with guns [ are not, + [ are, + are ] probably not ] from the people that [ are, + are ] buying them through legitimate channels anyway.  /
h          B.10 utt3:  {F Uh, } that may be wrong.  /
sv          B.10 utt4: {F Uh, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } certainly [ there, + there ] are cases [ of, + ] [ of, + ] {D you know, } children who find their parents' gun or something [ and, + and ] shoot a brother or sister or, {D you know, } things like that that need to be definitely avoided  /
sv          B.10 utt5: {C and } [ that's, + that's ] certainly within the channels,  /
b          B.10 utt6: right. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } a lot of [ the, + the ] crime, I think, that goes on, [ I, + I ] don't know to what the degree the guns [ are, + are ] purchased through regular channels  or  they're illegal guns. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
h          A.13 utt2: I don't know,  /
sd          A.13 utt3: this morning in our paper, [ it, + ] there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license,  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C so } he went over there and got a driver's license, the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for, {D you know, } very high markups.  /
sv          A.13 utt5:  {D Now, } in a sense, that's a legal --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  -- way of getting the guns,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: {C but } certainly the --   

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- the purpose is not very legal. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
%          B.18 utt2: yeah,  /
%          B.18 utt3: {E [ I, + I ] mean, } I think, {F uh, } some sta-, - /
sd          B.18 utt4: {C or, } [ I, + I ] don't know if it's been actually been implemented,  /
sd          B.18 utt5: I think so, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.18 utt6: {C or } at least there's been talk about doing, {F uh, } {D you know, } like waiting periods [ and + --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- and ] things like that.  /
sv          B.20 utt2:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think stuff like  that is perfectly good.  /
sv@          B.20 utt3:  {E I mean, } basically, [ [ if you, + if you ] don't intend to do anything stra-, + ] {D you know, } [ if you, + if you're ] buying it for legitimate purposes, waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem.    

b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

+@          B.22 utt1:  {D You know, } [ and, + and, ] things.  /
h          B.22 utt2:  I don't know,  /
%          B.22 utt3: I've, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.22 utt4: [ I, + I ] don't own a gun [ and, + and ] don't really <laughter> want one, /  

x          A.23 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.24 utt1:  {C and } I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } on the other hand, {D you know, } {F uh, } like I say,  I [ kind of, + kind of ] against government control in general.  /
%          B.26 utt2: {F Uh, } /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          A.27 utt2:  {C And } I suppose [ com-, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } [ c-, + ] total ban would lead to more illegal weapons. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.28 utt2: {C and } I, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.28 utt3: something about banning is that, {D you know, } [ there, + there ] are so many weapons out there [ that, + that ] they're not going to disappear anytime soon.  /
%          B.28 utt4:  {F Uh, } {C and } they're already, - /
sd          B.28 utt5: I know there's a ready market for them, {D you know, }  /
%          B.28 utt6: in  the s-, - /
sd          B.28 utt7:  the [ stolen, + stolen ] guns can be sold.  /
sv          B.28 utt8:  {E I mean, } the first thing [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] burglar will pick up if he can is a gun. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.29 utt2: uh-huh. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: [ because, + {F uh, } because ] they, they can be so easily sold  /
%          B.30 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } [ they're, + they're, ] - /
sd          B.30 utt4: I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country,  /
sv          B.30 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden.   {F Uh, } even if you do do a total ban on them.  /
sd          B.30 utt6: {F Uh, } it's a real tough problem. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

h          B.32 utt1:  [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: I don't know where I really come down on it.  /
sd          B.32 utt3:  {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] grew up, - /
sd          B.32 utt4: my father was a hunter,  /
qy          B.32 utt5: right,  /
sv          B.32 utt6: [ {C and } that's, + {C and } that's ] sort of almost a separate issue.  /
sv          B.32 utt7:  I think we've generally been talking about handguns and  that kind of thing,  /
^g@          B.32 utt8: right?    

ny          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.34 utt1:  {D You know }  /
%          B.34 utt2: {C and, } -/  

aa          A.35 utt1:  {C But } that's true.  /
sd          A.35 utt2:  {E I mean, } some people grew up with guns in the house.  /
sd          A.35 utt3:  We never had any in the house -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  -- {C so, } to me, [ the, + {D you know, } the ] first time I saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing. /  

o@          B.38 utt1:  {F Um. }   

b          A.39 utt1:  {C And } I'm not sure that's good either. /  

+@          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {D well } [ we, + {D you know, } we, ] I grew up with them.  /
sd          B.40 utt3:  I never really took to  hunting.  /
sd          B.40 utt4:  {E I mean, } I did some of it,  /
sd          B.40 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we didn't have  any, + we never had any ] handguns or anything like that.  /
sd          B.40 utt6:  We  [ had, +  {D you know, } had ] shotguns [ for, + for ] quail and pheasant hunting and things like that. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } it was a whole different thing  /
sd          B.42 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] gun safety was taken very seriously  /
%          B.42 utt3: {C and } it was, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.42 utt4: {E I mean, } before we go hunting, [ we, + we ] took safety courses, {F uh, } {D you know, }  /
%          B.42 utt5: [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] it, - /
sv          B.42 utt6: {C but, } {D you know, } [ that's, + that ] seems to me to be just a whole another issue. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.44 utt1:  <Static> <lipsmack> {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] thing, - /
%          B.44 utt2: [ the, + the, ] - /
%          B.44 utt3: yeah,  /
sv          B.44 utt4: I'm not certain that people [ [ are, + are, ] + are ] terribly concerned about other people. /
