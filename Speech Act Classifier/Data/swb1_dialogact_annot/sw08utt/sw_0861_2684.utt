sv          A.1 utt1:  I think you got it. /  

o          @B.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: {F Uh, } my first thoughts on capital punishment i-, - /
%          @B.2 utt3: I, - /
sv          @B.2 utt4: the first thing I want to say [ i-, + is ] no.  Just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } we are punishing someone for taking someone's life,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C or, } in some cases, we are punishing [ s-, + ] [ one-, + ] a person for taking someone's life.  /
sv          B.4 utt3: {C And so } in effect we are committing that same crime. /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {D Well, } it sounds like you have really strong views on it. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C And } I can see that point,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C but } I also have this, {D you know, } - /
%          A.7 utt3: [ I, + I ] question. - /
sd          A.7 utt4: I guess I can look at it both ways.  /
sv          A.7 utt5: {C And } just to play devil's advocate,   

b          B.8 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.9 utt1:  # it # never seems right to me, that, {F uh, } we take in people that are criminals --   

b          B.10 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /

%          B.14 utt1:  Ac-, -/  

%          A.15 utt1:  {C And } it just, - /
sv          A.15 utt2: [ that, + that ] I find very difficult to swallow,   

b          B.16 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.17 utt1:  # sometimes.  # /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  One thing I don't understand is [ the, + the ] whole concept of death row. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Okay,  /
sv          B.20 utt2: these people are supposedly, I guess waiting to die,  /
^g          B.20 utt3: right? /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  I'm with you there. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Okay.  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {C And } there are thousands upon --   

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  -- thousands of people on --

+          B.26 utt1:  -- death row.  /
sd          B.26 utt2:  {C And } I'm not saying that, {F oh, } - /
qh          B.26 utt3: I guess I am kind of saying, [ what, + what ] are we doing?  /
sv          B.26 utt4:  {E I mean } I guess that's the same thing you were saying.  /
qh          B.26 utt5: [ What, + what ] are we doing with these people? /  

%          A.27 utt1:  Ha-, -/  

sd          B.28 utt1:  They're there, - /
sv          B.28 utt2: we should {C either } take some kind of action,   

aa          A.29 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          B.30 utt1:  # {C or } # take enough {C or } --   

aa          A.31 utt1:  Exactly. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- go a different route.  /
%          B.32 utt2:  {C But } they're just, -/  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {C And then } when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs,   

aa          B.34 utt1:  # {F Oh, } exactly. # /  

+          A.35 utt1:  # {D you know, } # we could be [ pay-, feeding + ] poor people and [ helping, + {D you know, }   

b          B.36 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.37 utt1:  # helping # ] the environment.  /
sv          A.37 utt2:  {E I mean, } prison is such a waste of a human being. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  It doesn't do anyone any good. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Exactly. /  

ny          A.41 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv^e          A.41 utt2: people need to be punished, /  

b          B.42 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  # {C and } # I do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.45 utt1:  {F Um, } {C but, } {D you know, } -/  

%          B.46 utt1:  # {C But } act-, # -/  

sv          A.47 utt1:  # {C but } locking # someone up and not getting, {D you know, } any benefit --   

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {C And } I guess I see both sides, in that [ at the, + at the ] same time that I'm saying that, {D you know, } we're committing the same crime, /  

b          A.51 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  # I # also agree that, {E I mean, } if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough --   

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  -- to kill somebody or --   

%          A.55 utt1:  {F Oh, } exactly w-, -/  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- in some cases, kill several people at one time.  {F Uh, } - /
sd          B.56 utt2: there was a case in Dallas, - /
sv          B.56 utt3: {D well, } I'm sure they haven't gone to court yet,  /
sd          B.56 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell.  /
sd          B.56 utt5:  They put four people in a freezer and shot them all.  /
sv          B.56 utt6:  {D Now } to me, that is inhumane.  /
sv          B.56 utt7: {C And } for two people to be out in the world like that, [ I don't, + I don't ] want them in my world. /  

aa          A.57 utt1:  That's right. /  

qy          B.58 utt1:  You understand what I am saying? /  

aa          A.59 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.60 utt1: [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + {E I mean, } I'm ] not for killing anyone, /  

b          A.61 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  # {C but } # I don't want these people around,   

^2          A.63 utt1:  # We want a # --

+          A.65 utt1:  -- safe environment for ourselves.  /
sv          A.65 utt2:  {C And } we want to remove them. /  

aa          B.66 utt1:  Exactly. /  

sv          A.67 utt1:  [ {C But, } + {C but } ] I think that the whole crux of the problem is,   

b          B.68 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.69 utt1:  # no # one has come up with a solution --   

aa          B.70 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.71 utt1:  -- that is acceptable,   

o@          B.72 utt1:  # {C And, } #   

+          A.73 utt1:  # that # does, {D you know, } basically, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.73 utt2: [ I, + I, ] think, {D you know, } that the whole idea of, {F uh, } the death penalty was invented for two reasons.  /
sv          A.73 utt3:  It [ remo-, + removes ] them from society, /  

+@          B.74 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv@          A.75 utt1:  # {C and } # number two, [ [ [ it's, + it's ] +  [ kind of, + ]   {F uh, } it's  the punishment, + it's the ultimate punishment. ]    

aa          B.76 utt1:  Right. /  

+@          A.77 utt1:  Because, {D you know, } they've harmed someone  /
sv          A.77 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } you want to appease the people that have suffered. /  

aa          B.78 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.79 utt1:  {C But } [ it, + it ] really doesn't take their pain away. /  

b          B.80 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.80 utt2: [ {C And } at, + {C and } at ] the same time, like you said, it drains society. /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          A.81 utt2:  {C But } it's a, -/  

%          B.82 utt1:  We, - /
sv          B.82 utt2: I think we should be, - /
%          B.82 utt3: we, - /
sv          B.82 utt4: the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and [ pu-, + ] keep these people in prison, that same money or half of that money could be used towards, {F uh, } rehabilitation programs of some sort.  /
sv          B.82 utt5:  Something --   

aa          A.83 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  -- [ to get, + [ to, + to ] put ] these people back in society,  /
sv          B.84 utt2: {C but } prepare them first. /  

aa          A.85 utt1:  Exactly.  /
%          A.85 utt2:  {C But } that, - /
sv          A.85 utt3: [ the pro-, + the problem ] is so incredibly complex.  /
sd          A.85 utt4:  I have a friend who works on the pardon and [ patr-, + ] [ paro-, + paroles ]  /
sd          A.85 utt5: {C and } she interviews,   

b          B.86 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.87 utt1:  # inmates # all the time that are coming up for parole. /  

b          B.88 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd(^q)          A.89 utt1:  # {C And } # she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to, {D you know, } have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded. /  

aa          B.90 utt1:  Exactly. /  

sv          A.91 utt1:  {C And } these people have not benefited from the stay there.  /
sv(^q)          A.91 utt2:  She says, just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong -- /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.93 utt1:  -- {C and } there's not anything she can do to keep them in.  {D You know, }   

b          B.94 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.95 utt1:  # if # they meet certain guidelines,

+          A.97 utt1:  # {D you # know, }  /
sv          A.97 utt2: {C and } those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work.  /
%          A.97 utt3:  {C So } it's, -/  

b          B.98 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.98 utt2:  {C And } [ y-, + you ] want people out of prison  /
sv          B.98 utt3: {C and } you want people to get jobs [ and, +

sv          B.100 utt2: {C But } they can't just walk out of prison and do that.  /
sv(^q)          B.100 utt3:  They can't just --   

aa          A.101 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.102 utt1:  -- walk out of prison and say, {D okay, } I'm going to go a different route. /  

aa          A.103 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.104 utt1:  There has to be some sort of buffer --   

b          A.105 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.106 utt1:  -- in there.  /
sv          B.106 utt2:  Some sort of program or, - /
sd          B.106 utt3: {C and } I know this costs money,  /
sv          B.106 utt4: {C but } it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending. /  

ba          A.107 utt1:  I know,  /
ba          A.107 utt2: I know.  /
sv          A.107 utt3: [  I, + I ] would like to see the money that's been [ budgeted, + budgeted ] for new prisons being put into the research [ of, + of ] alternate solutions to the problem. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qh          A.109 utt1:  How are we going to fix that, Tanya?  /

ba          B.112 utt1:  {F Oh, } goodness.  /
sv          B.112 utt2:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } everyone's trying to make it, {D you know, } in their own little world. /

ba          A.117 utt2: I know,  /

b          B.118 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
