o@          A.1 utt1:  Let me ask you.  Do you think the Soviet Union is a, still a threat to the United States? /  

%          B.2 utt1:  Do you know - /
h          B.2 utt2: I don't know what to think.  /
%          B.2 utt3: [  I, + I, ] {F uh, } - /
sv          B.2 utt4: the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort.  /
sv          B.2 utt5:  I want to believe [ that, + that ] they really are trying to change. [ That, + that ] maybe they are headed for a more democratic society  /
sv          B.2 utt6: {C and } [ I, + I ] want to believe it's all okay. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {C But } then there's that side of me that says, <lipsmack> yeah,  /
sv@          B.4 utt2: {C but } they've put on faces before.    

b          A.5 utt1:  Right. /  

+@          B.6 utt1:  And never to this extent though, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.6 utt2: [ {C so, } + {C so } ] it's like there is a struggle within me going [ do, + do ] I <lipsmack> be open-minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality.  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  {D You know } [ I, +   

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.8 utt1:  I ] trust people.  /
cc          B.8 utt2:  I'll do that.  /
qh          B.8 utt3: {C Or } do I keep on going, {D well, } we'll wait and  see <laughter>. /  

sv          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } I think there's [ a, + a ] struggle within the Soviet Union.  /
sv          A.9 utt2:  {F Um, } I think the people [ are, + are ] just fed up,  /
sv          A.9 utt3: {C and } I think it's showing  /
sv          A.9 utt4: {C and } all the republic is trying to gain their independence,  /
sv(^q)          A.9 utt5: {C and } I think, {F uh, } that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, {D hey, } maybe this Communist thing isn't working. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.10 utt2: that's it's not just a [ mere-, + ] [ or, + ] {F uh, } western society telling you [ [ i-, + it's, ] + it ] doesn't work. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sd(^q)          B.12 utt1:  {D You know, } they've always said, {D you know, } [  the, + the ] Soviet people were united,  /
^q          B.12 utt2: we believe this,  /
sv(^q)          B.12 utt3: {C and } maybe they are seeing that, [ {D no, } + {D no, } ] {D hey, } we don't believe this, {D you know. } /  

b          A.13 utt1:  That's right. /  

o@          B.14 utt1:  {C But, }   

%          A.15 utt1:  I think, -/  

+@          B.16 utt1:  it's still, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.16 utt2: I guess I keep that one part of me that's like, - /
sv          B.16 utt3: {D well, } I don't know I want to trust them  /
%          B.16 utt4: {C and } I, - /
sv          B.16 utt5: it's like I can't,  /
sv          B.16 utt6: {C and } maybe it's because, {D you know, } we've had our own propaganda over the years,  /
h          B.16 utt7: I don't know. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } [ that, + that ] could be.  /
%          A.17 utt2:  You know what I, - /
sv          A.17 utt3: [ we always, + we ] think of the K G B and we think such bad things, {D you know. }  /
sv          A.17 utt4: {C But } I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, {D you know. } /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  {C And } they probably do the same things. /  

aa          A.19 utt1: [ Exac-, + exactly. ]  /
sv          A.19 utt2:  They do. /  

qh          B.20 utt1:  You think the C I A doesn't spy?  /
sv          B.20 utt2:  I'm sure they do. /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sv^m          A.21 utt2: they do, {D you know. } /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {D Now } the difference is [ we don't, + [ I, + I ] don't ] think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {D You know, } I think to that extent we don't go as far  /
sv          B.22 utt3: {C but } I'm sure they lie.  <laughter> {D You know? } /  

aa          A.23 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
aa          A.23 utt2:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {D So, } -/  

sv          A.25 utt1:  That's part of that propaganda thing,  /
sv          A.25 utt2: {C and } I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, <sneezing> {F oh, } - /
fa          A.25 utt3: {E excuse me, } I've got a cold today. /  

bd          B.26 utt1:  That's all right.  /
by          B.26 utt2:  I hope you get better <laughter>. /  

ft          A.27 utt1:  Thank you.  /
sv          A.27 utt2: {F Um, } I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are [ [ seeing, + seeing  it, ] + ] {D you know, } thinking K G B and C I A and all that  /
sv          A.27 utt3: {C but, } {F uh } --   

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast [ they are, + they ] ain't going to be able to feed their people [ this, +   

b          B.30 utt1:  <<Very faint>>  Yeah. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  this ] winter, {D you know. } /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

o@          A.33 utt1:  {C But, }   

aa          B.34 utt1:  That's true. /  

+@          A.35 utt1:  on the other hand, I'm kind of getting fed up with, {F uh, } our own country and  presidency, {F uh, } always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet. /  

ar          B.36 utt1:  <Lipsmack> {C And } I'm not against them being concerned  /
sv          B.36 utt2: {C but } I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort [ and, + and ] energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ any, + any ] country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, {D you know, } because [  I, +  I ] understand that, {D you know, } you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {C But } at the same time [ I, + I ] agree.  /
sv          B.40 utt2:  I don't think we can do it [ and, + and ] just, {D you know, } turn our backs [ or, + or ] be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  That's right.  /
sv          A.41 utt2:  {D You know, } [ we've got, + {F uh, } we've got ] quite a few domestic problems [ that, + {F uh, } that ] I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.  /
sv          A.41 utt3:  I think the problem is, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.41 utt4: on the international scope maybe the president feels that, {F uh, } {D you know, } for long-term relations with all these countries it's important  /
sv          A.41 utt5: {C and } {D well, } [ we'll, + we'll ] always have the United States.  /
sv          A.41 utt6:  {C And, } {D you know, } we need to solve these international problems  /
sv          A.41 utt7: {C but, } {F um, } I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, {F uh, } the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time [ on dem-, + on a domestic ] issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.42 utt2: [ [ we, + we, ] + we ] believe in what he's doing abroad  /
sd(^q)          B.42 utt3: [ {C but, } + {C but } ] like you said there's issues here too. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.44 utt1: [ {C And } + {C but } ] [ I, +  I ] am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  I'm encouraged by what's happened in, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] iron curtain countries, {D you know, }   

b          A.45 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.46 utt1: [ in, + in ] that block  /
sv          B.46 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think it's moved in the right direction.  /
sv          B.46 utt3: [ I, + I ] think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yep. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {D You know, } it's not going to. -/  

aa          A.49 utt1:  No. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  It didn't happen here overnight,  /
sv@          B.50 utt2: {C and } it didn't happen here without a struggle.    

aa          A.51 utt1:  That's right. /  

+@          B.52 utt1:  {D You know. } /  

aa          A.53 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  {C And } [ I, + ] [ I + ] think sometimes we forget that.  /
sd          B.54 utt2:  {C But } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] have to say, {D yes, } [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm ] encouraged by the way it's going.  {F Uh, } /  

o@          A.55 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I,
