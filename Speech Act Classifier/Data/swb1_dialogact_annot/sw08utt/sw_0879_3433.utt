o          A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
qw          A.1 utt2:  What do you think of the public school system?  /
qy          A.1 utt3:  First off, do you have children that are in it? /  

na          B.2 utt1:  I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C and } I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,   

bk          A.3 utt1:  # {F Oh, } okay <laughter>. # /  

+          B.4 utt1:  # system <sniffing>.  /
%          B.4 utt2:  {C So, } # -/  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {D Well } then, you should be a good one to know because [ I, + ] my children are grown now.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I now have grandchildren,   

b          B.6 utt1:  # Oh. # /  

+          A.7 utt1:  # in the # school system  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C so, } {F uh, } I don't have firsthand experience right now,   

b          B.8 utt1:  # Uh-huh,  /

qo          A.9 utt2:  {C So } what do you think? /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {D Well, } I think the public school systems are doing a good job.  /
sv          B.10 utt2:  I think they have a long way to go yet  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {C but } I think that, {F um, } they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.  /
sd          B.10 utt4:  You know, my kindergartners [ were on the, + were on the ] computers,  /
sv          B.10 utt5: {C and } I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.  /
sv          B.10 utt6: {C And } I think that, {F uh, } the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, {D you know, } skills.  /
o@          B.10 utt7:  {D You know, }

sv          B.12 utt2: you figure out why you're adding it and  what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.  /
sv          B.12 utt3: {C And } I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,  /
sv          B.12 utt4: they literally cannot come in out of the rain. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:  <Laughter> That's right <laughter>. /

sd          B.16 utt1:  # {C And, } {F uh, } # this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C So } I think, {D you know, } [ they're, + they're ] trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,  /
sv          B.16 utt3: {C and } I think that's very, very important. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa          A.17 utt2: it is.  /
sv          A.17 utt3: [  I, + I ] agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, - /
sd          A.17 utt4: we have a, {F uh, } fourth grader  /
sd          A.17 utt5: {C and  then } we have one that's in kindergarten  /
sd          A.17 utt6: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children  [ was doing, + ] were doing in the fifth and sixth grade. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd@          A.19 utt1:  {D You know, } it's amazing,

sd          B.24 utt2: {C and } her pre-algebra book is higher then <laughter> some of my Algebra Two,   

x          A.25 utt1:  <Laughter>.

b          A.29 utt1:  # Right. # /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  # {D You know, } # {C so } [ they're really, + they're really ] moving them along  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C but } yet, <sniffing> at the same time, {D you know, } they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life. /

%          B.32 utt1:  # {C And } # that's wha-, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.32 utt2: a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          B.34 utt1: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I think that [ it's, +  it's ] appropriate to teach them, {D you know, } why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  <Laughter> Correct.  /
qy          A.35 utt2:  Are you finding that, {F uh, } since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {F Um, } I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms. /

sd          B.38 utt1:  <Sniffing> {D Well, } filling out the forms and also all of these, {F uh, } statewide and national wide testing,   

b          A.39 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.40 utt1:  # things # so that they compare  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {C and }  ((   )) .  {D You know, } [ you can + as far as I'm concerned you can ] make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {C And } it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  {C And } you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,   

%          A.43 utt1:  # Be, - /
b          A.43 utt2: uh-huh. # /  

+          B.44 utt1:  # {D you know, } # that [ I think it's, + {F uh, } I think it's ] crazy personally  /

sd          B.46 utt1:  {D You know, } [ the fir-, + the whole first ] nine weeks of school [ is, + is ] used as a review  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C but } more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,

sv          B.48 utt2: {C And } I think that's totally useless.  /
sv          B.48 utt3:  I think, {D you know, } there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons  /
sv          B.48 utt4: {C but } I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.  /
sv          B.48 utt5:  It's like  bragging on your grandchildren. /
