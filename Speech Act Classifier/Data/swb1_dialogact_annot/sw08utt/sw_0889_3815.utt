sd          B.12 utt2: I've had so many times when, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I'll have a friend next to me or I see [ somebody, + ] {F uh, } guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  It is just a real pain,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C or, } {D you know, } if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, {F uh, } somebody that I know and you try to talk to them --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.17 utt2: right. /  

sv          B.18 utt1: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] power locks, power windows are [ just, +  just ] things that, {F uh, } just really help a lot <laughter>. /

sd          A.21 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess I'm, {F uh, } more traditional in that I don't like [ p-, + <laughter> power ] windows or power locks,   


x          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.23 utt1:  because the people that I know [ h-, + ] who have them always seem to have trouble with them. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I don't, + I just don't ] like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work <laughter>. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Sure. /

b          B.34 utt1:  -- {F uh, } yeah.  /
sd          B.34 utt2: [ I, + {D actually, } I ] like the anti-lock brakes. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: that's a good idea. /

sd          B.36 utt2: I have been in cars that have had them,  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C but } I've never tromped on the brakes [ to see, + {F uh, } {D you know, } on ice or water just to see ] if they didn't lock up. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /

qr          B.38 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } you think you'd buy, {F uh, } an American car or a European or  Japanese? /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, + {D actually } I ] don't know a lot about different brands.  /
sd          A.39 utt2: I tend to have, {D you know, } my requirements like the last time I bought a car [ I, + I ] guess I did sort of prefer American  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {C and } my requirements were basically, {D you know, } good repair record, good mileage, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.39 utt4: <lipsmack> {C and } I needed air-conditioning  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> can't remember what my, {F oh, } - /
sd          A.39 utt6: I wanted [ s-, +  {F uh, } stick ] shift.  {C And,  so } I didn't have a whole lot of choice <laughter>.  /
sd          A.39 utt7: There was one car in all of [ the, + the ] metropolitan area that I could find that, {D you know, } was sort of a medium priced car with a <laughter> stick shift in it. /  

qw          B.40 utt1:  What was that? /  

sd          A.41 utt1: [  It, + it ] turned out to be [ a, + a ] Chrysler.  {F Uh } <lipsmack>, Lancer. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Huh,  /
b^m          B.42 utt2: stick shift,  /

nn          A.45 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.45 utt2: a five speed.  /
sd          A.45 utt3: {C And } [ it, + basically, it ] was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up,  /
sd          A.45 utt4: {C and so } it had been on the lot three months  /
sd          A.45 utt5: {C and } they were really eager to sell it. /  

ba          B.46 utt1:  Wow. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {C So, } I guess in this area, at least, {D you know, } if it's not automatic, it doesn't move. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {D Well, } {D actually, } I much prefer a stick shift  /
%          B.48 utt2: {C and, } what, [ I'm, + I'm ] curious. - /

sd          A.49 utt1:  {D Well, } I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {C and } I thought it would be more reliable. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore. /

b          B.62 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  Not that I was looking for sports cars,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: {C but, } {D now } the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Huh. /  

qw          A.65 utt1:  {C And so } why do you like stick shift? /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {F Uh, } I guess [ I, + I ] grew up on it {C and } it's fun.  /
sd          B.66 utt2: [  It's, + it's ] an enjoyable part of driving.  /
sd          B.66 utt3: I do feel like I have, {F uh, } more control --   

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  -- over the car  /
sd          B.68 utt2: {C and } [ [ it, + it, ] + to me, it ] gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice --   

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- and slick conditions. /

h          B.72 utt2: I don't know,  /

sv          B.72 utt4: [ else. + ]  As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun  <laughter>. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.73 utt2: {C and } {D actually } it's probably safer on, {D you know, } [ at + ] long trips because it keeps you more active. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.74 utt2: yeah  /
