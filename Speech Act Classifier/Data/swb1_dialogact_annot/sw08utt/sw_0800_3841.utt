qw^t        A.1 utt1:  our topic today? /

b             B.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } yeah,  /
sd^t          B.2 utt2: something about the school system here. /

b          A.3 utt1:  Right,  /
sd           A.3 utt2: {C and } {D now } I'm sort of, don't know if this an  advantage or  disadvantage.  /
sd          A.3 utt3: My wife's a school teacher  /
%          A.3 utt4: {C so } <laughter>, -/ 

cc          B.4 utt1:  {D Well, } then, [ I'll, + {F uh, } I'll ] walk softly. /

ar          A.5 utt1:  <Laughter> No.  /
ad         A.5 utt2:  # You go right ahead because I, #   

x          B.6 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

+          A.7 utt1:  have a lot of strong opinions on it, too.  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  My wife teaches seventh grade,  /
sv          A.7 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system.  /
sv          A.7 utt4:  I think the, - /
sv          A.7 utt5: I don't think the teachers get enough support, quite honestly. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } for example, my wife, she has kids that are on drugs,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and, } of course, like everyone, she has kids that get pregnant [ even, + even ] in the seventh grade. /  

qw          B.10 utt1:  What school system does she teach in? /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  Plano School System. /  

ba          B.12 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C But } to give you an example, {F uh, } {D you know, } one of her kids will come in and  [ he's, + you could tell he was ] just bombed out on drugs,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } she sends him to the principal's office,  /
sd(^q)         A.13 utt3: {C and } the principal sends him right back, or her  right back, and says, {D Hey, } your problem, you take care of it.  / 
sd          A.13 utt4:  You're not allowed to send them home.  /
sd          A.13 utt5:  {D You know, } if you do that, then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever,  /
%          A.13 utt6: [ your, + your, ] - /
sd          A.13 utt7: you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day,  /
sv          A.13 utt8: {C and, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] a numbers game.  /
sv         A.13 utt9: I don't think that's right, [ if they're, + especially if they're ] interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning. /  

arp        B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } I think it's more of a, - /
sv      B.14 utt2: there's a bigger problem here than, {F uh, } than discipline in the schools.  /
sv          B.14 utt3: I think it gets back to the, {F uh, } parental participation into the program. /

aa          A.15 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {F Um, } to give you an example, both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District, /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } it's a public system, however, you'd think that it was a private school, because  I take it, the best teachers and the best students, - /
sd          B.16 utt3: they're taking top three percent that have tested out, {D you know, } in the district and, {F uh, } put them in this academy system,  /
sd        B.16 utt4: {C and } to get into the system's very difficult.  /
sd          B.16 utt5:  {C But } once you're in, {F uh, } they have, they have self-paced programs,  /
sv          B.16 utt6: {C and so } you have students that want to learn  /
sv          B.16 utt7: {C and, } {F uh, } you have teachers that want to teach,  /
sv          B.16 utt8: {C and } you have parents that are really interested in the children,  /
sv          B.16 utt9: {C and } basically, {F uh, } there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that <laughter> --   

b          A.17 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- {F uh, } because <throat_clearing> most of the people that are in the academy system, {F uh, } are Caucasian, and, because you have to test into the system. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  {C And } most of, - /
t1          B.20 utt2: that's not all true,  /
sv       B.20 utt3: {C but } I'm saying a large percentage of them are,/
sd       B.20 utt4: {C and } also the other large percentage [ is + is ] that all the parents just about, of these kids, {F uh, } have college degrees, at least one parent does.  /
%          B.20 utt5:  {C And  so } there's, - /
sv(^q)          B.20 utt6: I think [ that, + {F uh, }  that's ] my justification for saying that the parents [ that are, + that are ] pushing their children at home, even if they don't know what their children are learning, [ they're, + they're ] saying do your homework, let me see it, don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you <laughter>. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  My son had such a tough time in, {F uh, } the school he went to  /
sd          A.21 utt3: {C but, } there was through, - /
sd          A.21 utt4: it wasn't all the school's fault,  /
sd          A.21 utt5: it was his fault also,  /
sd          A.21 utt6: {C but } we put him in a private school in Richardson,  /
sd          A.21 utt7: {C and } [ that, + that ] cost more, - /
sd          A.21 utt8:  that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters,  /
sd          A.21 utt9: that was more than his college tuition was -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah  /
x          B.22 utt2: <laughter>.   

sd          A.23 utt1:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } it had to be done,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: at least it took care of him and, {F uh, } threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and, {F uh, } want to learn something.  /
sv        A.23 utt3:  {C But } I'll tell you what, [ [ there's a, + there, ] + there ] are a few faults, to say the least, in the school systems today. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.24 utt2:  I think what we've done is, {F um, } {F um, } especially looking at, {F um, } the South Dallas area, is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed. /  

b         A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv        A.25 utt2: I think we have that problem dealing in most areas, which is unfortunate. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } that also probably crosses over into business, because now, businesses also say that if you're  [ not, + ] don't have the proper education, {F uh, } including, {F uh, } exposure to high tech fields --   

aa          A.27 utt1:  You bet. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- such as computer technology, if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do, {F uh, } data base management and do, I forget all the other stuff, financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job, {F uh, } you can't function --   

aa          A.29 utt1:  You bet. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- {D you know. } /  

x          A.31 utt1:   ((   )) .   

sv          B.32 utt1:  {C So } I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world  /
sv(^q)          B.32 utt2: {C and } the business world then says, we're not going to pay you, unless you have the education,  /
%          B.32 utt3: {C and then } educ-, - /
sv          B.32 utt4: {C and [ then, + then ] } [ we, + what we've ] done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself. /  
 
b          A.33 utt1:  Sure.  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {D Well, } teachers, {D you know, } they have a, a tough row to hoe, so to speak, [ they just, + ] always fighting the system.  /
sd          A.33 utt3:  I don't know if it's better than any, - /
sd          A.33 utt4: {D you know, } we came down to Texas from the, {F uh, } New York area,  /
sd          A.33 utt5: we were there for a short time,  /
sd          A.33 utt6: {C but } my wife is from New York,  /
sd          A.33 utt7: {C and } she was born and  raised there, and educated there, college and everything,  /
sv         A.33 utt8: {C and } I think, {D you know, } the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south, I don't care where you're from.  /
%          A.33 utt9: {C And } [ they, + they, ] - /
sd          A.33 utt10: I don't know if they learn more,  /
sv      A.33 utt11: {C but } [ they certainly, + {F uh, } they ] have a tendency to learn more,  /
sd        A.33 utt12: {C and } in that part of the country there is all nationalities, /
