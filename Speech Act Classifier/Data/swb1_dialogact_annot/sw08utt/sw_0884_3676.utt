sd          A.17 utt1:  {F Um, } several years back one [ we saw, + we saw ] we really, really enjoyed was, {F uh, } ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, {F uh, } Timothy Hutton and, {F uh, } Mary Tyler Moore,  /

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {C But } I thought it had a wonderful message to it.  It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said, {D You know, } I think I liked that <laughter>. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {C And then } the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, {D You know, } I did like it <laughter>. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C But } when you first came out, you weren't real sure. /

sd          A.51 utt3: {C but } then again, she's got a whole lot on the ball,  /
sd          A.51 utt4: {C and } the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, [ [ more than, + more than, ] + ] {D you know, }  /
sd          A.51 utt5: it wasn't a mystery,  /
sd          A.51 utt6: it wasn't, {D you know, } blood and guts and violence [ and, + and ] car chases type thing.  /
sd          A.51 utt7: It was just a good movie. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING. /
