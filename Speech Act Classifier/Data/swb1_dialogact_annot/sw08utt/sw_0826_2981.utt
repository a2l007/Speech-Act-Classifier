o          @A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qw          @A.1 utt2: {D well, } what's your opinion about capital punishment? /  

sv          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } Cathy, I think that, {F uh, } capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, {F um, } maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.3 utt2: I think I would agree with you on that, too.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: [  I, + I ] can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation, {F uh, } [ keeping them, + ] {D you know, } paying for them to live in prison for years and  years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem.  /
sv          A.3 utt4:  Maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped. /  

aap      B.4 utt1:  That might be true,  /
%          B.4 utt2: {F um, } I'm, - /
qh          B.4 utt3: what I don't know, is where do we draw the line. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Right. /  

qy          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,  /
qrr          B.6 utt2: {C or } do we extend it beyond that? /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
br^m      A.7 utt2: beyond murder or just beyond {D like } first degree murder? /  

no        B.8 utt1:  {D Well, } either, {D you know. }  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {F Uh, } I have  [ a, +  a ] nine year old daughter,  /
sv          B.8 utt3: {C and } there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, [ that, + that ] I would consider basis for murder. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah.  /
b^r          A.9 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.9 utt3: {D well } that really gets into a sticky issue.  /
sd          A.9 utt4:  {F Uh, } I could see that too.  /
sv          A.9 utt5:  I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder that [ someone, + I think someone ] would probably deserve to be killed for.  /
ba        A.9 utt6:  {C But, } gosh,  /
qh          A.9 utt7: {C and } who's going to decide which is how bad, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.9 utt8: something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,  /
sv^r          A.9 utt9: {C and, } {F uh, } it's gets into a pretty sticky issue. /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa          B.10 utt2: it does.  /
sv          B.10 utt3:  A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable  and, {F um, } to what's allowable and where are we. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } if we [  were, + lived ] in a different country, then murder is not so bad. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  {C But } over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of [ purs-, + life, liberty and ] pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is [ a, + a ] heinous act. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
^2         A.15 utt2: in some eyes.  /
sv          A.15 utt3:  I think some people give up that <laughter>.  /
sv          A.15 utt4:  I think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges [ than, + than ] what most people think of them as.  /
sd          A.15 utt5:  I don't know what, {F um, } Texas's criteria for [ capital murder is, + [ do, + ] capital punishment is, ]  /
qy          A.15 utt6: do you know?  /
qy          A.15 utt7: Are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances? /  

h          B.16 utt1:  I don't know.  /
sv          B.16 utt2:  I believe it's, {F uh, } at the discretion of the judge or jury. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.17 utt2:  I used to live in Virginia,  /
sd          A.17 utt3: {C and } I know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, {F um, } if someone killed a police officer or  someone committed rape and then murder.  /
sv          A.17 utt4:  Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too limited. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  I tend to agree with you there.  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {F Um, } my belief [ is that, + is that, ] {F um, } any crime that's freely committed, {D you know } - /
%          B.18 utt3: freedom of choice -- -/  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  -- these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- such as rape, deserves punishment by death.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  {C But } then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: in general terms I'm not so harsh,  /
sd(^q)          A.23 utt3: {C but } then whenever I hear of a specific case, {D you know, } where someone did something, then it's like,  {D yeah, }  put it to them <laughter>.  /
sd          A.23 utt4: {C So, } I think I probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes.  /
%          A.23 utt5:  Because, - /
%          A.23 utt6: yeah,  /
aa          A.23 utt7: I think you're right,  /
sv          A.23 utt8: that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,  /
sv          A.23 utt9: they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,  /
%          A.23 utt10: just beca-, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.23 utt11: they ruin someone else's life. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  All right,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  -- than a person who commits a crime [ to, + ] either for the thrill of committing the crime or [ the thrill, + the feeling ] of power that they get from it, or to [ acquire drugs for some other, + {E I mean } acquire funds for some other ] illegal activity. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  {D You know, } that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: [ the, + the ] first guy, {D you know } I just assumed it was a guy, the first person,   

x          A.29 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.30 utt1:  that went out to rob a store for food, that to me [ is, + is ] a different set of circumstances, where [ he, + he ] deserves help instead of, {F uh, } loss of life. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

x          B.32 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
bf@          A.33 utt2: he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else.    

aa          B.34 utt1:  That's right  /
%          B.34 utt2: {C or } with the, -/  

+@          A.35 utt1:  Or with no regard for someone else's well being.  /
qh          A.35 utt2:  What about, {F uh, } {D like } teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that.  {D Say } fifteen, sixteen year old.  /
qy          A.35 utt3:  Would you consider, {F uh, } capital punishment for them? /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  <Laughter> Uh-huh. /  

%          B.38 utt1:  There's some, - /
h          B.38 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I ] certainly don't know myself,  /
sv          B.38 utt3: {C but } somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include [ the, + the ] consideration [ of, + of ] long term consequences --   

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  -- begins. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah,  /
^2          A.41 utt2: what age they're accountable,   

qy@          B.42 utt1:  {D You know, }   

+          A.43 utt1:  for their actions. /  

+@          B.44 utt1:  I have an eighteen year old,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } {D well } he's nineteen  now,  /
sd          B.44 utt3: {C and } I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year, /  

x          A.45 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C And } I have an eleven year old and a nine year old,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C and } I [ don't, + don't see ] it in them yet,  /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C but } [ I'm, + I'm ] not sure where it begins. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.47 utt2: I know that they are lowering the age of, {F uh, } whatever is considered a minor.  /
sv          A.47 utt3: I think [ the kids, + certain kids ] have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,  /
%          A.47 utt4: {D like, } - /
sd          A.47 utt5: I think I read about a boy that was nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them,  /
