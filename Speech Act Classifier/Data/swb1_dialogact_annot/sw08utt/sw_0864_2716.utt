sv          A.13 utt3: {C but } [ I, + I'm ] really leery of a, kind of a government administrative health insurance or  medical plan, because I just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly  /

aa          B.20 utt1:  That's true.  /

aa^r          B.22 utt2: that's true. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And } in England, at least at the time when I was familiar with it, about ten years ago, they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {F Oh, } you - /

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I had to switch because I just thought he was a quack.  /

aa          A.37 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          A.37 utt2:  That's exactly the problem,  /

%          A.37 utt4: {C and } it's, - /
sv          A.37 utt5: {C but } {D see, } I guess, what they had in England, and I guess in Canada is socialized medicine. /  

+@          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  {C So } maybe, that's {D like } the extreme of it.  /
qy          A.39 utt2:  Do you think? /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.40 utt2: yeah,  /
sv^m          B.40 utt3: that is the extreme,  /

sv          B.40 utt5: it probably has two, a good and a bad side,   

b          A.41 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.42 utt1:  # for # young people wanting to become doctors.  Which again a lot of people who are motivated, because the money isn't, I guess, as much,

sv(^q)          B.48 utt1:  {C but } then again, {D you know, } you don't get those people who would be good,   

b          A.49 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          B.50 utt1:  # and # are real smart and decided, {D Hey, } I want to make a lot of money,  /
^q          B.50 utt2: {C so } I will go into medicine.  /
sv          B.50 utt3:  You don't get those. /

aa          A.51 utt3: yeah,  /
aa          A.51 utt4: exactly,  /
sv          A.51 utt5: {C or } people also get the feeling that, {D well } {D jeez, } {D you know, } [ you don't have to worry about, + ] you have a lot of job security there,  /
sv          A.51 utt6: {C and } it's more of, {F uh, } seniority, I would imagine kind of thing, instead of having a skill [ or, + or ] whatever to advance, /  

aa          B.52 utt1:  # Yeah.  /
aa          B.52 utt2:  That's true.  # /

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: it would be nice to see something where at least, -/  

sv          A.55 utt1:  I think we have to have something.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:  We really do. /  

sv(^q)          B.56 utt1:  {E I mean, } even something that says {D you know } look, free major medical for all, {D you know, } everyone  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C and then, }

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  I ] think the problem with the skyrocketing cost right now is the insurance companies because,

%          B.68 utt1:  {C So } that - /
