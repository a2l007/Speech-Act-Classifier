sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } their schools are kind of rundown and, {F uh, } older  /
sd          A.9 utt5: {C and } they don't really <lipsmack> offer as much, {A I don't know, } as, {F uh, } the school that my girls are in.  /
sv          A.9 utt6: I don't really think that's fair.

sd          B.12 utt3: [ is + there's ] a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {F Uh, } I grew up in New York  /

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  -- {C and } I went to, {F uh, } the City of Rochester  School District -- /  

b^r          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         B.20 utt1: -- {C and } [ s-, + a lot of ] my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs  /

sv          B.20 utt3: {C but } the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial -- /  

b^r          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1: -- {C and, } {F uh, } one of the things that probably would have been better [ if, + ] is if the entire county [ had had, + had ] just one school system. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.24 utt1: {C And } that [ would result in some, + {F uh, } could result in more ] equitable distribution of money  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {C because } what was happening was, {D you know, } all the very rich people [ went out to the, + move out to the ] suburbs  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C and } the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1: -- of money to work with.  /
sv          B.26 utt2: As a result, the schools were rundown,  /
sd          B.26 utt3: there wasn't as many, {D you know, } of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked.  /
sd          B.26 utt4: There wasn't as many advanced placement courses, {F uh, } when I was a senior --

+          B.28 utt1: -- that some other schools had.  /
%          B.28 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } [ it, + it, ] - /
sv          B.28 utt3: {C so } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] think that [ one of the things, + one of the ways ] [ [ to, + to, ] + to ] help schools in general, {F uh, } and get them all to a minimum level [ [ of, + of, ] + of ] competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people,  /
sv          B.28 utt4: {C and } [ the, + the ] problem with that is [ [ then, + then, ] + then ] [ people will either, + the rich people will either ] pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or --   

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- they'll move farther away <laughter> --

+          B.32 utt1: -- to get better schools.  /
sv          B.32 utt2: {D So, } {D you know } [ it, + it's ] kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. /  

sd          A.33 utt1: Also, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] family environment, - /
sd          A.33 utt2: {D you know, } you can come to south Tyler where I live  /

sd          A.35 utt2: You can go to north Tyler to the schools  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C and } the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is.

+          A.37 utt1: {D You know, }  /

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
