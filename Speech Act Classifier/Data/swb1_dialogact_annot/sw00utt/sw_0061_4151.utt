qy          A.1 utt1:  Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore? /  

^h          B.2 utt1: That's a good question.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {F Uh, } [ there would be a point, + there was a point ] where I would have said, no, that no one would deserve to die [ for, + for ] a crime that he committed.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C But, } {F uh, } since I've become a parent and since I've seen, {F uh, } things like Jeffrey ((Dahlmer)), I really have to question that.  /
sd          B.2 utt4: [ [ I + really, {F uh, } I, ] + I ] can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment.  /
%          B.4 utt2: {F Uh, } -/  

sd          A.5 utt1: Of the statements made by people against [ the, + the ] death penalty, {F um, } [ I, + I ] like the statement made by Cuomo.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: Cuomo I believe is, - /
sd          A.5 utt3: {F um, } [ he's, + he's ] governor of New York  /
sd          A.5 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } he's, {F uh, } against the death penalty.  /
sd          A.5 utt5: {C But, } {F um, } he said that [ he would, + he would ] want [ to, + to ] seriously hurt or if not kill someone [ if, + if ] they did something to his wife.  /
%          A.5 utt6: {C And } that's, - /
sd          A.5 utt7: [ {C but, } + {C but, } ] [ even, + even ] [ in that circumstan-, + in that, {F uh, } {F uh, } situation ] [ he would b-, + he would hope ] that there would be people around him who would, {F uh, } keep him from <laughter> [ doing the, + doing the ] things. /  

sv          B.6 utt1: {F Oh, } [ it's a, + {F uh, } it's a ] question of [ your, + your ] gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          A.7 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          B.8 utt1: {F Uh, } [ {C a-, } + {C and } ] that was the thing that, {F uh, } killed Dukakis back, {F uh, } four years ago when someone asked him a similar question  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C and } [ he, + he ] thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when, {F uh, } people wanted to see if he was going to go for [ an emotion -- +   

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1: -- {F uh, } a gut level ] reaction.  /
sv          B.10 utt2: {C And } I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level.  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {F Uh, } {D you know, } whether it be a biblical force, {F uh, } {D you know, } the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a [ knife, + life ] type logic or just, {F uh, } {F uh, } some sort of anger at [ putting peop-, + putting, {F uh, } murderers ] up in federal pens for the rest of their life, {F uh, } while we foot the bill. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.12 utt1: I think people [ are, + are ] working at that from more of [ a, + {F uh, } a ] gut reaction than [ a, + a ] reason humane one. /  

sv          A.13 utt1: {D See, } I don't think the decisions that are going to be made [ on dea-, + on the death ] penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do.  /
qh          A.13 utt2: Are they reformatories, where we're trying to take people who can't survive [ or, + or ] [ that, + that ] aren't conforming enough to society so [ that, + that ] we work well together.  /
%          A.13 utt3: Or are they, - /
qh          A.13 utt4: is it a penal institution?  /
qh          A.13 utt5: [ [ Is it, + is, ] + is it ] designed for punishment?  /
sv          A.13 utt6: {F Um, } the death penalty surely fits in well [ with, + {F uh, } in ] a penal situation where you're trying to punishment.  /
sv          A.13 utt7: {F Uh, } perhaps not in the manner that we do it  /
sv          A.13 utt8: [ {C but, } + {C but } ] [ it, + [ in, + in ] theory it ] fits in.  /
%          A.13 utt9: [ [ In reforma-, + system, ] + in a reformatory, ] {E I mean } <laughter> - /
sd          A.13 utt10: [ if you, + if you ] put someone to death you obviously,   

x          B.14 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.15 utt1:  can't reform <laughter> them. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:  That's true. /  

%          A.17 utt1:  {D So. } -/  

sd          B.18 utt1: {F Uh, } [ th-, + the ] other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C and } I really don't, {F uh, } agree with that.  /
sv(^q)          B.18 utt3: I don't think anyone who would commit [ a, + {F uh, } a ] crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, {D well, } I was about to kill and dismember this person  /
^q          B.18 utt4: {C but, } {F oh, } if they catch me they're going to kill me  /
^q          B.18 utt5: {C so } I better not do it.  /
sv          B.18 utt6: [ I, + I ] just,   

b          A.19 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.20 utt1: # don't # think [ that, + {F uh, } that ] it works that way. /  

sv          A.21 utt1: I don't think it's done.  /
sv          A.21 utt2: I don't think we run it as a deterrent.  /
sd          A.21 utt3: {E I mean } people say that,  /
sv          A.21 utt4: {C but, } {E I mean, } if it was really a deterrent, {E I mean } I think like horse thieves in the old west, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.21 utt5: they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1: -- every once in a while.  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C And } [ if we really w-, + if it was really ] seriously going to be a [ d-, + deterrent, ] I would think that it would be public.  /
sv          A.23 utt3: {E I mean } I don't think it would be this private thing because [ nobody ever, + nobody ever ] sees it.  /
%          A.23 utt4: If someone ever, - /
%          A.23 utt5: if, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.23 utt6: like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime, had to sit and watch [ and, + and ] see a guy burn [ or, + or, ] {D you know, } something or shot by a firing squad or something like that.  /
sv          A.23 utt7: I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than, {D you know, } telling them that [ there's, + there's ] protestors out here at the, {D you know. } -/  

sv          B.24 utt1: {D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't know if that would really work that way or not.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {F Uh, } there's a lot of violence, /
