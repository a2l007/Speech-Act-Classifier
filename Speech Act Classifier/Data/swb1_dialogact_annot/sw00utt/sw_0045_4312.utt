sd          @B.2 utt1: {D Well, } I have a, {F uh, } pretty wide taste, {F uh, } in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, {F uh, } lot of different forms of, {F uh, } music.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: In fact, it's easier for me to say, {F uh, } the types of music that I don't like are opera and, {F uh, } screaming heavy metal. /  

aa          A.3 utt1: <Laughter> The opera, {D yeah, } it's right on track.  /
sd          A.3 utt2: I like classical,  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C but } I can't deal with opera at all. /  

x          B.4 utt1:  <Cough>.   

sv          A.5 utt1: {C And } heavy metal, {F uh, } it's noisy.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I'm into, {F uh, } some industrial music that's, [ a, + a ] bit even harder than that. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1: {C But } [ it's, + it's ] got to have a point to it. /  

sd          B.8 utt1: {F Oh, } I don't mind music that's <child_yelling> difficult to listen to, /  

x          A.9 utt1:  <Laughter>.    

sv          B.10 utt1: {C but, } {F uh, } [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } basic point of heavy metal [ w-, + which ] seems to be music to annoy you,

sv          B.18 utt2: {F Uh, } R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, {F uh, } {D you know, } ultra mainstream at this point,  /
sv          B.18 utt3: {C and } it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. /  

aa          A.19 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah.  /
aa^r          A.19 utt2: Yeah,  /

b          A.35 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          B.36 utt1: {C And } I could, {F uh, } go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him <laughter> not making nearly as much money. /  

sv          A.37 utt1: <Laughter> {F Uh, } {C but } he picked the right songs  /
