fp          A.1 utt1: Hi.  /
qy          A.1 utt2: {D So, } do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have? /  

nn          B.2 utt1: {F Uh, } actually no,  /
sd^e          B.2 utt2: [ {C because, } + {C because } ] I'm in school.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: [ I, + I ] kind of miss out on most of the current events.  /
sd          B.2 utt4: I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. /  

qy          A.3 utt1:  Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then? /  

ng          B.4 utt1: {F Uh, } I don't watch a lot of it,  /
%          B.4 utt2: {C but } that's the on-, - /
sd          B.4 utt3: basically that's my only major source of information. /  

%          A.5 utt1:  {F Um. }  /  

qo          B.6 utt1: [ What about, + what about ] you? /  

sd          A.7 utt1: {D Well, } I read, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.7 utt2: I get a bunch of different things.  /
sd          A.7 utt3: I get a newspaper every day  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C and } I try to [ at, + at ] least have a few minutes to look through that  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C and } I look through, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.7 utt6: I get a NEWSWEEK every week which [ I, + I ] pretty much read that cover to cover  /
%          A.7 utt7: {C and } I, as far as, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.7 utt8: that satisfies most of the short term news I get.  /
sd          A.7 utt9: {F Uh, } don't watch much T V,  /
sd          A.7 utt10: don't have enough time  /
sd          A.7 utt11: {C and, } {F uh, } don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.7 utt12: they might give you a little blurbs like --   

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.9 utt1: -- this happened or that happened  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and } that's about all I ever hear of it.  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {F Uh, } {C but } most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } for the longer term [ I, + I ] read, {F uh, } {D like } SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they, - /
sd          A.9 utt5: the news isn't, {D like, } immediate what you'd generally think of as news,  /
sd          A.9 utt6: {C but } it's recent material. /  

^2          B.10 utt1:  {C And } it's more in depth. /  

aa          A.11 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.11 utt2: [ it is, + it is ] more in depth, less broad.  /
ar          A.11 utt3: {D Well, } {D actually, } it's, probably isn't less broad,  /
sv          A.11 utt4: {C but } it's just more in depth  /
sv          A.11 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } [ [ it is, + it is more sig-, ] + it is more just significant ] information, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.11 utt6: It is the big events, not the little events. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.13 utt1: Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.14 utt1:  I know,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: where they're just trying to fill in. /  

aa          A.15 utt1: Yes,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: {C or } they're [ making, + making ] time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.17 utt1: {F Uh, } I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because --   

b          B.18 utt1:  I know,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: [ I do, + I do, ] too. /  

+          A.19 utt1: -- it goes so slow  /
sv          A.19 utt2: {C and, then } there's nothing that, {D you know, } really is {D like } {F oh, } so exciting. /  

b          B.20 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.20 utt2: you may find one little, {F uh, } news item interesting  /
sv          B.20 utt3: {C so } you have to wait twenty minutes [ to, + to ] hear about it. /  

b          A.21 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: [ that, + that's ] about what it ends up being.  /
sv          A.21 utt3: Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something <laughter>. /  

b          B.22 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {D actually, } [ y-, + you ] mention NEWSWEEK,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do like, {F uh, } U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.  /
sd          B.22 utt4: I don't get to read it as much as I like,  /
sv          B.22 utt5: {C but } [ that's, + I think that's ] a good magazine. /  

b          A.23 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.23 utt2: I think they're about the same.  /
sv          A.23 utt3: [ [ I, + {D you know, } they, ] + they ] certainly have a very similar, {F uh, } charter at least in my mind.  /
qw          A.23 utt4: {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ [ what, + what kind of, ] + {F uh, } what kind of ] news normally interests you,  /
qw          A.23 utt5: {E I mean } [ what do you, + [ what, + what ] do you ] find interesting --   

sd          B.24 utt1:  {D Well } --    

+          A.25 utt1:  -- versus what do you find boring? /  

+          B.26 utt1: -- right now trying to keep abreast of, {F uh, } what's going on in Europe, {D you know, } with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, {D you know, } European community coming together. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.28 utt1: That's going to affect our, {F uh, } economy quite a bit. /  

aa          A.29 utt1: I think it will, - /
sd          A.29 utt2: {F uh, } [ they, + they ] keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,  /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C but } we've yet to see it  /
%          A.29 utt4: {C and } th-, - /
sd          A.29 utt5: it's real short term yet, though,  /
sd          A.29 utt6: {E I mean, } it's only been, three months or something like that --   

b          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          A.31 utt1: -- since that happened  /
%          A.31 utt2: {D so, } -/  

b^r          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.33 utt1: {C But } they like to tell us that it's going to be important <laughter>. /  

sv          B.34 utt1: [ I'm, + I'm ] pretty sure it is, because, {F uh } --   

aa          A.35 utt1: I think it is, too. /  

+          B.36 utt1: -- [ once, + once ] Europe becomes unified and, {F uh, } their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, {F uh, } kind of hurting <laughter>. /  

aa          A.37 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: [ I, + I ] think that's a possibility, - /
sv          A.37 utt3: {F uh, } [ it, + we ] might also be helped, though, because [ it, + it ] will be easier to do business over there, too. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.38 utt2: definitely. /  

sv          A.39 utt1: For the companies that already have a presence over there  /
sd          A.39 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it --   

b          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah -- /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- came time. /  

bf          B.42 utt1:  -- so they have a toe hold,  /
bf^r          B.42 utt2: I good toe hold. /  

aa          A.43 utt1: Yep.  /
sv          A.43 utt2: {C Because } once you're in there, then you can easily expand.  /
sv          A.43 utt3: {C But } getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult. /  

b          B.44 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.44 utt2: {C because, } when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist  /
%          B.44 utt3: {D so, } -/  

aa          A.45 utt1:  Yes. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.47 utt1: {C And } there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,  /
sv          A.47 utt2: even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, {D you know. } /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.49 utt1: {D Like, } England doesn't want to do one thing  /
sd          A.49 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] Sweden doesn't want to do other thing  /
sv          A.49 utt3: {C and } [ they're, + they've ] all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. /  

b         B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.51 utt1: {C And } some of it, {E I mean, } is, - /
sd          A.51 utt2: I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified. /  

b          B.52 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.52 utt2: [ I, + I ] can understand their viewpoint,  /
sd          B.52 utt3: [ they're just, + they're ] starting off,  /
sd          B.52 utt4: their economy's a little bit weak,  /
sd          B.52 utt5: {C so } you want to --   

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.54 utt1: -- get established before they --   

^2          A.55 utt1: Before they --   

+          B.56 utt1: -- com-, -/

aa          B.58 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.58 utt2: totally. /  

qw          A.59 utt1: {F Uh, } what is the, {F uh, } - /
qy          A.59 utt2: do you watch anything {D like } with sports or anything like that? /  

^h          B.60 utt1: {D Actually } I'm not really into sports.  /
