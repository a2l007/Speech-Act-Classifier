qr          A.1 utt1: Do you know anyone that, {F uh, } [ is, + is ] in a nursing home or has ever been in one? /  

nn          B.2 utt1: No.  /
sd^e          B.2 utt2: {C But } [ I, + my grandparents ] were looking into it before  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C so } I know what they've said. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b^m          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

^h          A.5 utt1: {D Well, } I'm trying to think.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: My, {F uh, } {F uh, } wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C and } they were going to put her into [ a, + a ] nursing home  /
sd          A.5 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } [ they, + when they ] put her in, she had all kinds of trouble  /
sd          A.5 utt5: {C and } the nursing home made them come <noise> and take her back because she <laughter> was being [ [ [ a, + a, ] + {D you know, } a, ] + a ] nuisance. # Or worse than a nuisance,  /
sd          A.5 utt6: {E I mean } # --   

bf          B.6 utt1:  # {F ((Oh)) } they thought it was too much of a bother. # /  

+          A.7 utt1: -- she sort of went, {D you know, } bananas  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C and } they [ couldn't, + couldn't ] deal with her <sigh>.  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C So, } I guess you need to, {F uh, } know whether it's [ a, + {D you know, } a ] no deposit, no return kind of thing whether <laughter>, -/  

aa          B.8 utt1: Right.  /
bf          B.8 utt2: If they're equipped [ too, + to ] handle the kind of patients you're going to have --   

aa          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.10 utt1: -- {D you know, } put in there too.  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C Because } I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.12 utt1: They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C but } they wanted to be independent as well.   

b          A.13 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  Have their own room. /  

sd          A.15 utt1: My grandmother actually was in [ a, + a ] nursing home that, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.15 utt2: there was a retirement hotel and then a, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.15 utt3: there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C so } for, {F uh, } the first few years she had her own apartment and, {D you know, } made her own meals sometimes. But [ could, + could ] also go and eat someplace else. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1: {C And then, } {F uh, } as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, {F uh, } provide full-time care  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } she didn't have to do anything anymore.  /
sv          A.17 utt3: {C But } my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.  /
%          A.17 utt4: {C And } that's som-, - /
sd          A.17 utt5: I don't know whether that's because they, {D you know, } sort of give up hope once they get in there or what [ the, + the ] reason is.  /
sv          A.17 utt6: {C But } I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only {D like } six months or something. /  

sv          B.18 utt1: {D Well } a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  They need health care  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C so } they're already ill before they go. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  That's probably a # large factor. # /  

b          A.23 utt1: # Yeah.  /
sv          A.23 utt2: [ If, # + if ] you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are.  /
sv          A.23 utt3: Then you only go there as a last resort. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C Or } people send you there as a last resort. /  

aa          B.26 utt1: Right,  /
aa^r          B.26 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.26 utt3: That's what my grandparents, - /
sd          B.26 utt4: it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1: {C So } that was their thinking.  /
sd          B.28 utt2: Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.30 utt1: {C And } also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make.    

b^r          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.32 utt1: So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time.  /
sv          B.32 utt2: I guess that's a problem too for people.  Wait lists and all. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
h          A.33 utt2: # I guess. # /  

%          B.34 utt1: # That, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.34 utt2: # you can't always get in when you want too  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } of course, you can't just sit around and wait. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          A.35 utt2:  When you need it, you # need it # --   

b          B.36 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- I guess. /  

qh          B.38 utt1: {C And } the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.40 utt1: At that stage of life you only have so much money left  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {C and } I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sv          B.42 utt1: # {E I mean } # it is kind of fair,  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {C but } it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  {C So } it's another problem. /  

sv          A.45 utt1: {C And } [ you probably, + if it were you, you probably ] wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price. /  

aa          B.46 utt1: Right,  /
aa^r          B.46 utt2: right.  /
sv          B.46 utt3: {C So, } [ it, + it's ] just so complicated anymore, I think <noise>.  /
sv          B.46 utt4: People outlive their savings.  /
sv          B.46 utt5: {C And, } with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down  /
sv          B.46 utt6: {C and } they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore. /  

b          A.47 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          A.47 utt2: {D Well } maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.  /
sv          B.48 utt2:  # I think # --   

b          A.49 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.50 utt1: -- the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay  /
sv          B.50 utt2: {C and } cause {D like } if your spouse died, (( )) all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you.    

b          A.51 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  To have friends. /  

aa          A.53 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: I've known quite a few people that have, {F uh, } gone to retirement communities.  /
sd          A.53 utt3: I don't know if they have them back there  /
sd          A.53 utt4: {C but } here in California and in Ari-, -/
