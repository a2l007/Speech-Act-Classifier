qy          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } have you ever served on a jury? /  

nn          @B.2 utt1: No,  /
sd^e          @B.2 utt2: I've not.  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: I've been called,  /
sd          @B.2 utt4: {C but } I had to beg off from the duty.  /
qy          @B.2 utt5: {C And } you? /  

na          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } I was called  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C and then } I was not chosen. /  

%          B.4 utt1: {F Um. }  /
sv          B.4 utt2: {D Well, } [ I was, + I was, ] {F uh, } originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow  /
sv          B.4 utt3: {C and } they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.  /
sd          B.4 utt4: I don't know why.  /
sd          B.4 utt5: Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago. /  

bh          A.5 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

ny          B.6 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.6 utt2: it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,  /
sd          B.6 utt3: {C and } <inhaling> they kind of liked me.  /
sd          B.6 utt4: I looked conser-, <breathing> and all that stuff  /
%          B.6 utt5: {C and } they, - /
sd          B.6 utt6: I don't know what they saw in me,  /
sd          B.6 utt7: {C but } they saw it.  /
sd          B.6 utt8: {C But, } {F uh, } back to the issue, [ is, + ] {F uh, } - /
h          B.6 utt9: I don't know,  /
sv          B.6 utt10: at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun.  /
sv          B.6 utt11: {C But, } there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases.  /
sv          B.6 utt12: In criminal cases, I'd like to see the [ unani-, + unanimity ] remain,  /
sv          B.6 utt13: {C but } in civil cases, I think a majority rule [ by, + by ] jury would be sufficient. /  

qo          A.7 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } could you give me an example of a case where you think that? /  

sv          B.8 utt1: {D Well, } in a criminal case, say one in which, {D you know, } there is, {D like, } say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, {F uh, } vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C And } in civil law there, {D you know, } is such a thing as {D like, } let's say, {F uh, } <breathing> misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.  /
sv          B.8 utt3: A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases.  /
h          B.8 utt4: I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. /  

sv          A.9 utt1: {D Well, } {E I mean, } I think, - /
qy          A.9 utt2: are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, {F uh, } tangible  /
%          A.9 utt3: {C or, } -/  

ny          B.10 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv^e          B.10 utt2: often there's more incriminating evidence.  /
ad          B.10 utt3: {D Like, } for instance, say, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.10 utt4: {C and } also, too, I think [ I'm, + I'm ] tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, {F uh, } serious in a criminal case. /  

qy          A.11 utt1: {D Well, } do you think [ that, + that ] in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up? /  

^h          B.12 utt1: {F Um, } {D well, } I really can't say for certain, truth be known.  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {F Uh, } as it stands, [ there's, + there's ] many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, {F uh, } in a [ ((civil)), + {F uh, } civil ] and criminal case.  /
sv          B.12 utt3: {E I mean, } the, {F uh, } documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that.  /
qy^d          B.12 utt4: {D You know, } I don't know [ for, + if ] you're familiar with that or not. /  

nn          A.13 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.13 utt2: I'm not. /  

sd          B.14 utt1: A, {F uh, } fellow <breathing> when he was much younger, {F uh, } was tried and convicted and sentenced to death.  /
sd          B.14 utt2: Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked  /
sd          B.14 utt3: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] he served out [ his, + his ] sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system.  /
sd          B.14 utt4: The case was reopened  /
sd          B.14 utt5: {C and } he was exonerated. /  

sv          A.15 utt1: {D Well, } {E I mean, } I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. /  

aa          B.16 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.16 utt2: many laws, but little justice. /  

%          A.17 utt1:  Say, - /
%          A.17 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } - /
sv          A.17 utt3: {C and } I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, {F uh, } [ [ the, + just, ] + the ] process of picking jurors is not always objective. /  

aa          B.18 utt1: {F Oh, } certainly not,  /
aa^r          B.18 utt2: certainly not.  /
sv          B.18 utt3: {C And } <breathing>, {D you know, } they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,  /
sv          B.18 utt4: {C but } they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.  /
%          B.18 utt5: {D You know, } the, - /
sd          B.18 utt6: {C because } you get up  /
sd          B.18 utt7: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] <breathing> they ask you a few questions,  /
sd          B.18 utt8: both sides do,  /
sd          B.18 utt9: {C and <breathing> then } [ you, + you're ] either challenged which is, - /
sd          B.18 utt10: {D you know, } each attorney can use that as much as they like  /
sd          B.18 utt11: {C or, } I think it's a limit now,  /
sv          B.18 utt12: they probably have a limit now,  /
sd          B.18 utt13: {C but, } they pretty much go through that,  /
sd          B.18 utt14: {C and then } you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.  /
sd          B.18 utt15: For me, it was financial hardship,  /
sd          B.18 utt16: [ {C so. } + {C But, } ] onto the thing, {F uh, } I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing.  /
sd          B.18 utt17: It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say. /
