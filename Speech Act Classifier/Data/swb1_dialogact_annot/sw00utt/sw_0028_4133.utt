============================================================================
  

sv          A.1 utt1: {D So, } {F uh, } {D you know, } my feeling is that, {F uh, } it's really being used today,  /
sv          A.1 utt2: [ [ [ it, + it, {D you know, } ] + it, ] + it ] really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. /  

aa          B.2 utt1: Right,  /
sv          B.2 utt2: I think I've seen some statistics that say that, {F uh, } it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. /  

aa          A.3 utt1: Right  /
sd          A.3 utt2: because [ [ y-, + you, ] + you've ] got [ all, + all ] the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.5 utt1: {F Uh, } {C and, } {D you know, } it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. {F Uh, } for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the [ c-, + crimes ] that would be eligible, {D you know, } really care. /  

%          B.6 utt1: {D Well, } that's, - /
sv          B.6 utt2: committing them mostly is, {D you know, } either crimes of passion or at the moment  /
sv          B.6 utt3: {C or } they think they're not going to get caught  /
%          B.6 utt4: {C or, } -/  

b          A.7 utt1: Right,  /
sv          A.7 utt2: {E I mean, } it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon, {D you know, }  /
^q          A.7 utt3: I'm invulnerable,  /
^q          A.7 utt4: I don't need to care about this.  /
^q          A.7 utt5: {D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] --   

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.8 utt2: [ b-, + ] /  

+          A.9 utt1:  -- never going to get caught. /  

b          B.10 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.10 utt2: {C but } you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, {F uh, } Jeffrey Dahlmer,  /
qy          B.10 utt3: do you want, - /
sv          B.10 utt4: by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: [ one, + one ] --    

sd          B.12 utt1:  Whereas --    

+          A.13 utt1:  -- way or another. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- if you kill him, there is not that possibility. /  

b          A.15 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: [ {C but, } + {C but } ] the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, [ or, + ] {D you know, } and somehow redeem himself. /  

b          B.16 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: I don't think he could ever redeem himself,  /
sv          B.16 utt3: {C but } --   

%          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, }      

+          B.18 utt1: -- in some cases, yes. /  

+          A.19 utt1: {D You know, } so that, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.19 utt2: [ [ the, + the ] question is, + {D you know, } the other [ qu-, + problem ] with capital punishment you run into is, ] what are you going to do about people who are later <laughter> to have been found innocent, {D you know? }  /
sd          A.19 utt3: There are cases where, {D you know, } twenty, thirty years after the fact of getting evidence, especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence, then, oops,  /
^q          A.19 utt4: I'm sorry,  /
^q          A.19 utt5: guess we killed the wrong guy. /  

b          B.20 utt1: Yeah,  /
%          B.20 utt2: [ it's, + it's, ] - /
%          B.20 utt3: yeah,  /
sd          B.20 utt4: once you've made a decision that way, it's a little difficult to go back on it. /  

b          A.21 utt1: <Laughter> Right,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: [ you, + you ] can apologize nicely,  /
sv          A.21 utt3: {C but, } {D you know, } {D you know, } I think, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] price, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.21 utt4: [ it, + {A I've heard quotes, } {D you know, } it's ] better that a thousand people go free, than one person be unjustly imprisoned. I think [ i-, + is ] really [ the, + the ] philosophy of the way our legal system works. /  

aa          B.22 utt1: {F Oh, } yeah,  /
aa^r          B.22 utt2: yeah,  /
%          B.22 utt3: it's a-, - /
sd          B.22 utt4: the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is, {F uh, } based on the, {F uh, } person who is accused. /  

b          A.23 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } [ [ the, + I, ] + I ] think that, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C and } the way it's being used now, it's like you listen to Bush [ is, + ] {D you know, } - /
qh          A.23 utt4: {D well, } where are we going to impose d-, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.23 utt5: it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing {D like } in, - /
sd          A.23 utt6: Tsongas is also saying, {D you know, } [ capital, + make it a capital ] crime to be a major drug dealer. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right. /  

sv*          A.25 utt1: {C And, } again, I don't thing these people care.  /*[[typo - replace thing with think]]
sv          A.25 utt2: They risk their lives every day. /  

b          B.26 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {C and, } [ [ there, + there, ] + they ] seem that [ [ the profit marg-, + {F uh, } drug dealers, ] + the profit margin's ] so high that, {D yeah } --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- [ the, + the ] risk is almost not there. /  

b          A.29 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } {F uh, } especially, now, I live [ in, + in ] Massachusetts, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.29 utt3: [ [ w-, + w-, ] + we're ] going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.31 utt1: {D So, } {D you know, } - /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C but } you look at [ our, + our ] crime rates and things like that and you compare them [ to, + to ] {D like } Texas or someplace that does, {D you know, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] impossible to make a case that [ it's, + it's ] affecting it in any way. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.33 utt1: I think it's mainly, people, {D like, } they get the vengeance of it. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.34 utt2: {D well } --   

%          A.35 utt1: {C Because, } {D you know, } -/  

+          B.36 utt1: -- it's also, - /
sd          B.36 utt2: I used to live in Georgia  /
sd(^q)          B.36 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment,  /
sv          B.36 utt4: {C but } if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related --   

aa          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, }  yeah -- /  

+          B.38 utt1:  -- and ethnically related, /  

sv          A.39 utt1: -- it's [ mainl-, + lot of ] blacks.  /
sv          A.39 utt2: Also a lot of young people.  /
sv          A.39 utt3: {D You know, } [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.41 utt1: {C And, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] think when you listen to {D like } [ [ the, {F uh, } + the, ] + the ] victims' families and things, they're always talking about, {D you know, } {F uh, } feeling justified or feeling, {D you know, } like they've gotten something out of it,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: {E I mean, } my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to [ the, + {F uh, } the ] victim's family.   /
sv          A.41 utt3: The only thing that should really, {E I mean, } - /
h          A.41 utt4: obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently,  /
sv          A.41 utt5: {C but } --   

b          B.42 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.43 utt1: -- {D you know, } [ [ th-, + {D you know, } what, ] + the ] important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society. /  

b          B.44 utt1: Right  /
%          B.44 utt2: {C and } that, - /
sv          B.44 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } also by keeping them in prison, you do have the possibility, {A though, we don't currently do this, } of making restitution. /  

b          A.45 utt1: Right,  /
%          A.45 utt2: {E ((I mean, } the)), -/  

sd          B.46 utt1: [ You, + you ] will work your prison job  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C and } any money you earn will go to the victim's family. /  

b          A.47 utt1: Right  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {C and, } [ the, + the ] other thing is that, {D you know, } I was reading through a book on, {F uh, } [ geneo, + human geneo ] research -- /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1: -- {C and } there, more and more things like schizophrenia - /
sd          A.49 utt2: {C and } why, does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

sv(^q)          A.51 utt1: {C So } if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say, {D well, } the problem is [ you, + you've ] got an endorphin imbalance  /
^q          A.51 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society --   

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.53 utt1: -- {D you know, }  /
sv          A.53 utt2: you really get back to the question of, {D you know, } is someone responsible for their actions. /  

b          B.54 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.54 utt2: {D well, } [ I, + I ] think on some of it, you have to say someone's responsible for his actions.  /
sd          B.54 utt3: [ I never like the, {F uh, } --   

^2          A.55 utt1: Society made me do it. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- the defense, +    

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  {D Well, } I never liked the, {F uh, } insanity defense. ] /
