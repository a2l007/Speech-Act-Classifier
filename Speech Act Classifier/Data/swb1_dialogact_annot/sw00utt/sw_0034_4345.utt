qr          B.23 utt2: [ Which, + {F uh, } which ] approach do you find to be, {F uh, } more useful, [ the, + the ] interpretive approach or the straight reporting? /  

sd          A.24 utt1: {F Oh, } I like the straight reporting.  /

sd          A.30 utt1: {C So } [ I, + overall, I ] think I would rather hear just straight reporting. /  

sv          B.31 utt1: One of the things that I found interesting last year during [ the, + {F uh, } the ] Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, {F uh, } Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, {F uh, } some of the things that were available.  /

sd          B.31 utt3: {C and } while he was being severely, {F uh, } censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda,  /
