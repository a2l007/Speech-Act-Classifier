============================================================================
  

sv          B.1 utt1: {D So, } let's talk about the, {F uh, } wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order  /
sd          B.1 utt2: {C and } after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties <inhaling> from the time that you bought it.  /
qo          B.1 utt3: What do you think?  /
qy          B.1 utt4: Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? /  

ng          A.2 utt1: {D Well, } {D actually, } I don't think they're out of line.  /
h          A.2 utt2: [ De-, + Devil's ] advocate possibly,  /
sv          A.2 utt3: {C but } <rustling> <inhaling> [ it, + you ] are trying to avoid paying taxes  /
sd          A.2 utt4: {C and } [ whe-, + whether ] or not you agree with that law, [ i-, + you're ] still circumventing it.  /
sd          A.2 utt5: You are legal [ in, + in ] your circumvention of that law. /  

qw          B.3 utt1: [ What, + what ] if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?  /
qw          B.3 utt2: {E I mean } what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, {F uh, } income tax on something that you purchase mail order? /  

sv          A.4 utt1: Really, [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't think that's a valid argument.  /
sv          A.4 utt2: I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.  /
sd          A.4 utt3: {F Um, } [ [ s-, + s-, ] + naturally [ some, + some ] ] things you just can't find in your local K-Mart [ or, + or, ] {F uh, } Bryn Mawr stereo dealer.  /
qh          A.4 utt4: {F Uh, } {C but } [ [ [ th-, + th-, ] + th-, ] + then ] why not [ pay, + pay ] the sales tax (( )).  /
sd          A.4 utt5: Corporations have to,  /
qh          A.4 utt6: why should an individual [ just because it's, + just because the state ] can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax? /  

sv          B.5 utt1: {D Well, } {E I mean, } it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania.  /
sd          B.5 utt2: It's because, {E I'm sorry, } the Commonwealth of # Pennsylvania. # -/  

b          A.6 utt1:  # Yes. # /  

sv          B.7 utt1: {F Uh, } it's because [ I, + I ] can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area.  /
sd          B.7 utt2: {C So } I go outside the area for that.  /
sv          B.7 utt3: {C And } I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, {D you know, } the revenue stream went to another state.  /
sv          B.7 utt4: [ I don't, + I don't ] think that that's my responsibility [ as a, + as a ] conscientious consumer. /  

aa          A.8 utt1: <Lipsmack> [ I, + I'll ] agree [ it, + it's ] not your responsibility  /
qh          A.8 utt2: [ {C but, } + {C b-, } ] is it also legal,   

x          B.9 utt1:  <Rustling> <static>.   

+          A.10 utt1: for you to do that?  /
sd          A.10 utt2: [ [ W-, + w-, ] + [ fr-, + from ] what ] I understand from [ [ v-, + v-, ] + various ] net readings, [ [ [ i-, + i-, ] + it, ] + the Federal government ] is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, {F uh, } [ in, + into ] place in the next few years.  /
sd          A.10 utt3: [ It is, + it is ] a lost revenue stream right now  /
sv          A.10 utt4: {C and } states [ c-, + can ] use all the revenue they can get.  /
qy          A.10 utt5: [ With some, + with something ] like that, [ d-, + do ] your arguments still apply? /  

no          B.11 utt1: {D Well, } I think that [ if, + if ] policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it.  /
sv(^q)          B.11 utt2: {C Because } it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that {F oh, } I bought this out of state.  /
^q          B.11 utt3: I need <sigh> to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania. /  

sd          A.12 utt1:  Which is exactly what businesses do at the present. /  

aa          B.13 utt1: Right.  /
sv          B.13 utt2: {C But } the point is is that businesses do that.  /
sd          B.13 utt3: The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.  /
sv          B.13 utt4: That's a cost of doing business.  /
sv          B.13 utt5: The # burden # --    

sd          A.14 utt1:  # {C And } [ [ I, + I ] + # --   

+          B.15 utt1:  -- shouldn't be placed on the consumer. /  

+          A.16 utt1: -- I ] was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then [ having, + having ] to pay sales tax on it. /  

%          B.17 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          A.18 utt1: That's my understanding of [ the way, + {F uh, } the way ] it works.  /
sd          A.18 utt2: Usually, [ the, + the ] person ordering doesn't pay.  /
sd          A.18 utt3: {C But } the accounting department will, {F uh, } suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay.  /
sd          A.18 utt4: {C And } [ there r-, + there are ] [ s-, + some ] substantial, nasty penalties, {F um, } [ if you, + if businesses ] try to avoid that. /

nn          A.22 utt1:  No.  /
sd          A.22 utt2:  Businesses, {F uh } --   

+          B.23 utt1:  Or purchasing. /  

+          A.24 utt1: -- if purchasing things mail order,  /
sd          A.24 utt2: [ if, + if ] I'm a computer consulting firm and I see [ these, + this ] great deal on forty-six mother boards, {F uh, } [ from, + from ] say Utah.  /
sd          A.24 utt3: {F Um, } [ I, + I ] might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax.  /
sd          A.24 utt4: My [ a-, + accounting ] department will at the end of the month.  /
sv          A.24 utt5: [ I think that [ i-, + i-, ] + I think that's ] the way things work in Pennsylvania.   /
sd          A.24 utt6: {C And } I know they work that way [ in, + {F uh, } {D say } here in ] D C. /  

b          B.25 utt1: Yeah.  /
sd          B.25 utt2: {D See } I'm unfamiliar with that because [ I don't, + I never  see ] that end of the business. /  

b          A.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.27 utt1: {C So, } my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.  /
sv          B.27 utt2: {F Uh, } {C but, } if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, {F uh, } the opportunity [ f-, + ] to forget that you owe sales tax for something, {F uh, } can be avoided. /  

aa          A.28 utt1: That's true.  /
sv(^q)          A.28 utt2: [ [ [ I-, + i-, ] + a r-, ] + a big ] hole does exist right now, {F uh, } in that consumers can just say {F oh, } [ I, + I ] forgot that.  /
sd          A.28 utt3: [ There, + there ] is no well defined mechanism at all  /
sv          A.28 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] that it is [ a + <inhaling> a ] [ l-, + loss. ] [ I, + I ] think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism [ [ ju-, + just ] to do + just [ that + ] [ in or-, + in order ] to ] gain the revenue that's being lost.  /
