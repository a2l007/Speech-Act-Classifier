o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

qo          B.2 utt1:  {D So } how serious is the,   

x          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.4 utt1:  subject of crime in your area? /  

sv          @A.5 utt1: {D Well, } needless to say, here in Washington, D C <laughter> this is the war zone.  /
sd          @A.5 utt2: {F Uh, } D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. /  

x          B.6 utt1:  <Laughter>.    

sv          A.7 utt1: [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] really bad here.  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {F Uh, } for example, <throat_clearing> the, {F uh, } local high school, {F uh, } they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns -- /  

ba          B.8 utt1:  Jeez. /  

sd          A.9 utt1: -- {C and } they're starting to, {F uh, } get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things.  /
%          A.9 utt2: {D So, } -/  

sd          B.10 utt1: {D Well, } luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.12 utt1: {F Uh, } San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.14 utt1: {F Uh, } {C but } it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, {F uh, } outlying agricultural towns.    

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1: {F Uh, } because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, {F uh, } largely around the Hispanic core. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.18 utt1: {F Uh, } it seems to be that, {F uh, } gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of <noise> poverty conditions. /  

aa          A.19 utt1: Uh-huh,  /
aa          A.19 utt2: right.  /
sv          A.19 utt3: That's how [ they, + {F uh, } they ] bind themselves together in groups, I guess  /
%          A.19 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.21 utt1: {D Now, } the, - /
sv          A.21 utt2: interestingly enough, I don't think we have here, [ a, + a ] lot of gangs, but, {F uh, } [ only a couple, {F uh } --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1: -- of, + not a whole large group of ] them, but, {F uh, } just a few.  Most of them centered around, {F uh, } drug territory. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.25 utt1: <Throat_clearing> {C And so } they're protecting their <laughter> economic interests, I guess. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

sd          A.27 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } nowadays the latest thing [ I've, + I've ] read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as, {F uh, } crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of stealing, {F uh, } cars {D like } at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up,  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C and then } as you get out of the car, they just, {F uh, } step up and, {F uh, } take the keys off of you and drive the car away <laughter> and leave you standing in front of your house. /  

ba          B.28 utt1:  {D Well, } that's efficient. /  

b          A.29 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.29 utt2: that's the, {F uh, } latest thing.  /
sd          A.29 utt3: That way there's no damage to the car or anything.  /
sd          A.29 utt4: They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. /  

sv          B.30 utt1: They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- of that sort. /  

b          A.33 utt1: Right.  /
sd          A.33 utt2: <laughter> Just wait for you to drive to your house,  /
sd          A.33 utt3: you get out  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C and } they get in <laughter>, /  

x          B.34 utt1:  <Laughter>.    

sd          A.35 utt1:  off they go with your car. /  

ba          B.36 utt1:  Wow. /  

%          A.37 utt1: <Breathing> {D So } it's, - /
sd          A.37 utt2: {F uh, } I think they call it car jacking around here <laughter>. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.38 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.38 utt3: I'd heard that phrase. /  

b          A.39 utt1: <Throat_clearing> Uh-huh,  /
%          A.39 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          A.39 utt3: that's kind of the latest thing,  /
sd          A.39 utt4: {C but } <breathing>, every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides,  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C so } [ it's, <lipsmack> + {F uh, } it's ] unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here,  /
sd          A.39 utt6: [ we're from, + {F uh, } I'm from ] Ohio  /
sd          A.39 utt7: {C and } my wife's from Florida  /
%          A.39 utt8: {C so, } -/  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.41 utt1: <Breathing> {C And } we've just come from twenty years in the military [ and, + ] {F uh, } which is an entirely different environment,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C so } this is a whole new thing [ for + <breathing>, for ] us [ to, + to ] have to put up with  /
sv          A.41 utt3: {C and } it's, {F uh, } really scary sometimes. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  there aren't that many,    

x          A.43 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.    

+          B.44 utt1:  places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. /  

b          A.45 utt1: Right.  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {C And } it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school -- /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1: -- {C and, } {F uh, } of course, the mayor, {F uh, } of D C is having a real problem, {F uh, } trying to, - /
qh          A.47 utt2: what do you do [ to, + to ] reduce crime [ in a, + in a ] major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody.  /
sd          A.47 utt3: [ It's, + {F uh, } I ] would hate to have to wrestle with that problem.  /
sd          A.47 utt4: I don't know [ what, + what ] the solution is.  /
sv          A.47 utt5: {F Uh, } there's no way they can stop the drugs,  /
sv          A.47 utt6: {C and } that's what's causing all the killing. /  

sd          B.48 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, }   

x          A.49 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> <<faint>>.   

+          B.50 utt1: <Breathing> there's a couple of things that I've heard,  /
sv          B.50 utt2: {F uh, } most of them are fairly, {F uh, } radical in terms --   

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  -- of what you'd have to do. /  

b^r          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.54 utt1: {F Uh, } course [ the, + <scratching> the ] reason [ that, + that ] these kids tend [ to, + to ] turn toward the drugs and everything else [ s-, + seems ] to be just, {D you know, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] end results [ of, + of ] poverty [ and, + and ] --   

b^r          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.56 utt1: -- parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C because, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } the parents aren't making a living at anything. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

%          B.58 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

sd          A.59 utt1: {C And } they see all their friends and neighbors, {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.60 utt1:  {C And } they're accidental parents half the time anyway. /  

b          A.61 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.61 utt2: {C and } their friends are driving Mercedes  /
%          A.61 utt3: {C and, so } it's actually, - /
sd          A.61 utt4: they grow up with that as their way of life  /
sv          A.61 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } I think, {F uh, } to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. /  

sd          B.62 utt1: It's illegal,  /
sv          B.62 utt2: {C but } it's not wrong because all their friends do it. /  

aa          A.63 utt1: Right  /
aa          A.63 utt2: <laughter> exactly,  /
sv          A.63 utt3: {C so } maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes  /
