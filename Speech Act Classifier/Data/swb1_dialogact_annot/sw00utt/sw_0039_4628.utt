qw          A.1 utt1: <Throat_clearing> [ Wha-, + what ] sort of company do you work for?  /
qr          A.1 utt2: Do you work for a big or a little place? /  

sd          B.2 utt1: {F Uh, } I work for Georgia Tech.  /
o          B.2 utt2: Yes sir.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: I work for the research facility.  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {F Uh, } <talking> {C and } [ it's, + it's ] kind of small in a sense  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C but } [ it, + it ] does have, about, {F uh, } I guess, two thousand civil employees. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1: {C And, } on [ a, + a ] scale, I guess it's still considered small.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: It just have a lot of different laboratories. /  

b^r          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1: The area I work in, [ it, + it ] primarily have maybe a hundred people or so. /  

b^r          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1: {C So } that's make up most of the laboratory  /
sv          B.8 utt2: {C so } [ from, + from ] that standpoint, [ it's pretty small + --   

b^r          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1: -- it's pretty small. ]  /
qo          B.10 utt2: What about yourself? /  

b          A.11 utt1: Huh.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {D Well, } [ I, + I ] work for, {F uh, } actually probably similar kind of place.  /
sd          A.11 utt3: I work for, {F uh, } Lincoln Laboratory. /  

bk          B.12 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

b          A.13 utt1: {F Uh, } yeah.  /
sd          A.13 utt2: We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech. /  

bk^r          B.14 utt1: {F Oh, } okay.  /
b          B.14 utt2: I see. /  

%          A.15 utt1: {F Uh, } <inhaling> {C and, } {F uh, } - /
sd          A.15 utt2: {C so } [ [ we're, + we're part, ] + we're actually part ] of M I T.  /
sv          A.15 utt3: {C So } it's very much the same kind of place # [ and, + ] {F uh } # --   

b          B.16 utt1:  # {F Oh, } okay. # /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- the technical institution. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Right.  {F Uh, } /  

sv          A.19 utt1: {F Uh, } while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of [ what, + {F uh, } {F uh, } what ] things were important, {F uh, } besides salary [ and a, + and a ] job.  I guess, {F uh, } (( )) list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe [ the, + {F uh, } the ] challenge of the work and, {F uh } --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  -- the working conditions, things like that. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  <Door> Right. /  

h          A.23 utt1: I don't know.  /
qw          A.23 utt2: [ What are your, + {F uh, } what sorts of things ] would you consider important? /  

sd          B.24 utt1: <Inhaling> {D Well } those and probably the security aspect of it. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1: Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, {F uh, } you're treated, - /
h          B.26 utt2: {C and } it may not be true in every place.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of [ a, + a ] person. /  

b^r          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.28 utt1: {C Because } when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people [ and, + and, ] {D you know, } their well being as far as, {D you know, } how [ they going, + their next dollar going ] to come in.  /
qh          B.28 utt2: How they going to pay their bills.  /
sd          B.28 utt3: They just lay them off. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.30 utt1: {C And } I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.30 utt2: I think the company still exists.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed <door> to just laying people off --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1: -- {D you know. }  /
sd          B.32 utt2: That way that, {D you know, } one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time. /  

b^r          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, {D you know, } other than [ s-, + {D you know, } something ] like, - /
sv          B.34 utt2: unemployment is good  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C but } {E I mean } the company as a whole - /
sd          B.34 utt4: {C because } you as an employee, even the company is making money,  /
sd          B.34 utt5: they paying you a salary  /
sv          B.34 utt6: {C but } you are responsible for that company growth.  /
sv          B.34 utt7: You're responsible also for helping that company get to the [ par-, + point ] that it's at at making profits.  /
sv          B.34 utt8: {C So } there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, {D you know, } {F uh, } neglect or something like that. /  

b^r          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.36 utt1: {D You know. } {C Because } it's not a person's fault that, {D you know, } people not buying or businesses [ are, + are ] not on the up and up all the time, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.36 utt2: I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, {D you know, } a number of people [ can, + can ] be the downfall of [ com-, + a company ] situation. /  

qo          A.37 utt1: {D Now } how do you mean that?  /
%          A.37 utt2: I know it, -/  

qw^d          B.38 utt1: {D Well } in a sense that say, how do you make [ a, + a ] conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people.    

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+         B.40 utt1: {F Uh, } for the bad times of the company.  /
qw^d          B.40 utt2: What about [ the, + the ] work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.42 utt1: {D You know. } In that standpoint. /  

qy          A.43 utt1: {D Well, } [ you, + you ] think it's better than [ to, + to ] try to spread [ the, + the ] effort equally among all the employees of the company  /
%          A.43 utt2: {C or, } -/  

ny          B.44 utt1:  [ Ye-, + yes, ]  /
sd^e          B.44 utt2: I do. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.46 utt1: I really do.  /
sv          B.46 utt2: I think it'd be better that way  /
sv          B.46 utt3: {C and } even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job # because # --   

b^r          A.47 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.48 utt1: -- they know [ that + (( )) that ] there are problems  /
sv          B.48 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } there are reason to look for another job --   

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

h          B.52 utt1: {D You know. } [ That's just, + that's ] my views, {D you know. } /  

b          A.53 utt1: Yeah.  /
sd          A.53 utt2: I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that.  /
sd          A.53 utt3: I think, {F uh, } back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile.  /
sd          A.53 utt4: They went to [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a ] four and a half day work week # rather # --   

b          B.54 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.55 utt1: -- than [ cut, + {D yeah, } just cut ] everybody back ten percent.    

b^r          B.56 utt1:  Right. /  

+         A.57 utt1: And, {F uh, } have to, give everybody a half day a week off. /  

b^r          B.58 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.59 utt1: {C And } I think you can do that for a little while  /
%          A.59 utt2: {C but } I'm, -/  

sv          B.60 utt1: {D Well } at least that would give a person a chance to look --   

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.62 utt1: -- {D you know. } Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance </talking>. /
