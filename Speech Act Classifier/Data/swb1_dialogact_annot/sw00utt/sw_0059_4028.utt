sd          A.1 utt2: {F um, } I guess we're going to [ talk, + ] describe, {F uh, } job benefits,  /
qw          A.1 utt3: {C and so } what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits? /  

sv          @B.2 utt1: {F Uh, } I would say the medical, {F uh, } group insurance area --   

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1: -- as far as, {F uh, } covering medical costs for yourself or family members. /

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1: -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,  /

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.12 utt1: I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to [ alter, + {F uh, } {D you know, } change ] companies,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C or } now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out  --

sv          A.19 utt1: -- {F um, } {C so, } [ that's, + in my opinion, [ that's get-, + that's bordering ] ] on a health clinic,  /
sv          A.19 utt2: {C but } it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.20 utt2: yeah. /

sd          B.22 utt2: {C and } I was in the H M O,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C and, } {F um, } I was because [ my, + my ] same doctor, {D you know, } agreed to be in it for, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.22 utt4: they usually sign a contract or something -- /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          A.25 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.26 utt1: -- I have ] to say it really works.  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C But, } again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: {F Uh, } if you've been going to a doctor for, {D you know, } ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for --   

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yes. /

%          A.31 utt2: {C and } I never really, - /
sd          A.31 utt3: {C so } the only doctor [ I, + I've ] kind of consistently had has been through the H M O,  /

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- {D you know, } for me it's worked out real good. /  

b          B.34 utt1: Right,  /
sv          B.34 utt2: {C but } if you, {D you know, } have a family [ and, + and, ] {F um, } everybody's gone to different doctors, {F uh, } it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and [ your, + ] just has, {D you know, } all the medical history  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } you feel comfortable with it. /

+          A.41 utt1: -- research branch,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: {C and } I guess another one [ that, + that ] I rank up there high is the, {F uh, } kind of job flexibility and time off, {F um, } I enjoy as a benefit. /  

aa          B.42 utt1: I do too.  /
