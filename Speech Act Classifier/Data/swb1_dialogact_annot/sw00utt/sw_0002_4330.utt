qy          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } does the company you work for test for drugs? /  

na          @B.2 utt1: {D Actually, } {F uh, } they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,  /
sd^e          @B.2 utt2: {C because } [ w-, + when ] I went to work for them, {F uh, } they didn't do that,  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } since then [ they've, + they've ] started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, {F uh, } convictions, but because the clients of our company [ are + ] requests that we do that. /  

%          A.3 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

qo          B.4 utt1:  How about you? /  

nn          A.5 utt1: {F Uh, } no,  /
sd^e          A.5 utt2: we're not being tested for drugs at all, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.5 utt3: our policies and procedures manual, {F uh, } the furthest it goes about drugs is in [ the, + kind of the ] miscellaneous section, or --    

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- it's reasons for immediate dismissal,  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  it says, use of narcotics on company premises. /  

%          B.8 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          A.9 utt1: {C So } that's pretty general,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } I work for an environmental management firm -- /  

b          B.10 utt1:  <Laughter> Okay. /  

sd          A.11 utt1: -- {C and } I'm an engineer there,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C but } I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {C but } I don't operate any machinery. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.13 utt1: {D Now, } people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.15 utt1: -- are under [ a, + a ] medical monitoring program,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: {C because } they're at a higher risk of exposure  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and } blood screening is part of that  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C and } [ I, + I ] think that drugs, - /
sd          A.15 utt5: they do test for drugs in that capacity,  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C but } it's not their exclusive, - /
sd          A.15 utt7: [ it's just part, + it's just something ] that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.17 utt1: {C But } I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.  /
qw          A.17 utt2: What is the nature of your company's business? /  

^h          B.18 utt1: {D Well, } it's actually, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.18 utt2: we do oil well services.  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C So, } a lot of our clients are [ oil companies, + big oil companies, ]  /
sd          B.18 utt4: {C and } they go out to, - /
sd          B.18 utt5: <inhaling> we have engineers who, {F uh, } go out [ to the oil well, + <thumping> [ to the, + to the ] client's oil well, ] [ and, + and ] work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,  /
sd          B.18 utt6: {C so } the clients are very concerned that, {D you know, } the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on [ their, + their, ] {D you know, } territory and everything,  /
sv          B.18 utt7: {C but } --   

%          A.19 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.20 utt1: -- the thing that's interesting is that [ I w-, + I'm an ] engineer [ and, + ] a software engineer  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } I work in the software, {F uh, } house,  /
sd          B.20 utt3: {C and } everybody there, {D you know, } are all software engineers.  /
sd          B.20 utt4: [ They've never, + {D you know, } they never ] go out to [ the, + the ] oil rigs or anything,  /
sd          B.20 utt5: {C and } yet, [ we're getting, + we're subjected ] to this policy, {D you know, } the same one that, {F uh, } [ th-, + all the ] engineers have [ to, + to, ] - /
h          B.20 utt6: {D well, } a little different, actually, - /
sd          B.20 utt7: {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we have to go through the same thing,  /
sv          B.20 utt8: [ [ {C and } it's, + {C but } it's, ] + {F uh, } it's ] a little different, I guess [ than + <noise>, than ] a lot of drug policies.  /
sd          B.20 utt9: In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,  /
sd          B.20 utt10: {C and } then if you get injured on the job, if you {D like } trip and fall or something, {F uh, } they give you a drug test right away.  /  

bh          A.21 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

sd          B.22 utt1: Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {C but, } a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.  /
sd          B.22 utt3: Particularly, {D like } <laughter>, {F uh, } we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,  /
sd          B.22 utt4: {C and } [ tha-, + they ] didn't find any problem with that, {D you know, }  /
%          B.22 utt5: {C but, } -/  

aa          A.23 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {F Uh, } -/  

sd          A.25 utt1: [ We, + that's ] been [ [ an, + a, ] + an ] issue, {F uh, } in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.  /
sd          A.25 utt2: ((In fact)), they'll <laughter> have these little parties,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C and } people will just get, - /
%          A.25 utt4: {E I mean, } I've, - /
sd          A.25 utt5: my brother lives where I work,  /
sd          A.25 utt6: {C and } I have many a time called him to come get me, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.25 utt7: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C but, } ] [ y-, + {D you know, } ] they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg.    

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

+          A.27 utt1: {D You know, }  /
sv          A.27 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } I think drug testing, - /
h          A.27 utt3: {C and } [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sv          A.27 utt4: [ [ I guess + I k-, ] + I think ] it's got some relevance,  /
sv          A.27 utt5: {C but } I think its relevance is pretty limited.  /
sv          A.27 utt6: {E I mean, } I think, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.27 utt7: in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.29 utt1: I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. /  

b          B.30 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: [ it's really, + it's really ] bizarre.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: {F Uh, } particularly, {D like } where we are, {D you know. }  /
%          B.30 utt4: [ I, + I, ] - /
sd          B.30 utt5: there was a story of a woman last year [ who, + who ] actually did slip on the ice [ and, + and ] {D like } sprained her ankle  /
sd          B.30 utt6: {C and } [ she, + she ] was a personnel secretary  /
sd          B.30 utt7: {C and } she <laughter> had to get tested  /
h          B.30 utt8: {C and, } I don't know  /
sd          B.30 utt9: I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.  /
sd          B.30 utt10: [ I, + {D you know, } I ] have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.30 utt11: [ they're, + they should ] be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense  /
sd          B.30 utt12: {C and, } {D you know, } it's like [ you're, + {E I mean, } employments are ] contractual by nature anyway -- /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1: -- {C but, } {F uh, } I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job [ that, + ] where I had to, {F uh, } {F uh, } do a drug test  /
sd          B.32 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ it's, + it was ] kind of a long story,  /
sv          B.32 utt3: {C but } [ it was, + it was ] just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,  /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C and } it amounted to, {F uh, } going in, {F uh, } before any of these interviews,  /
sd          B.32 utt5: I'm not even working for this company,  /
sd          B.32 utt6: I'm going in for, {D like, } interviews  /
sd          B.32 utt7: {C and } they flew me out to Chicago  /
sd          B.32 utt8: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } before I went into any of the interviews, {F uh, } they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.  /
sd          B.32 utt9: They said it was going to be a physical, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.32 utt10: {C and, } {F uh, } {D actually } [ bec-, + beforehand ] they told me they were going to, {F uh, } do drug screening,  /
sd          B.32 utt11: {C but } I had forgotten about that,  /
sd          B.32 utt12: {C and so, } basically, I'd already peed off ((in)) that morning  /
sd          B.32 utt13: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] when I got in there, [ I didn't, + I wasn't, ] {D like, } able to give a full sample,  /
sd          B.32 utt14: {C and so } --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.34 utt1: -- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water --   

b          A.35 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.36 utt1: -- before <laughter> I went to any of the interviews and go in there again, - /
sv          B.36 utt2: [ {C and } the, + {C and } [ the, + the ] ] procedure is utterly humiliating.  /
sd          B.36 utt3: You go in there with the doctor,  /
sd          B.36 utt4: he makes you take off all your clothes  /
sd          B.36 utt5: {C and then } he examines you. /
