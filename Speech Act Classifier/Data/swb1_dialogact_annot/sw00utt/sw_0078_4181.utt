sv          A.1 utt1:  I don't think anybody pays too little. /  

aa          B.2 utt1: No,  /
aa          B.2 utt2: I would tend to agree very highly.  /
sv          B.2 utt3: I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it. /  

qy          A.3 utt1: Do you get hit up for local taxes there? /  

ny          B.4 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.4 utt2: we sure do.  /
sd          B.4 utt3: Here in Indiana [ we pay, + {F uh, } we pay ] county income tax, state income tax,  /
sd          B.4 utt4: we pay five percent sales tax,  /
sd          B.4 utt5: {F uh, } you name it, they tax it. /  

bf          A.5 utt1: {F Oh, } {C so } [ [ y-, + y-, ] + you ] get the whole smorgasbord. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  That's right  /
%          B.6 utt2: we, -/

b          B.10 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /  

sv          B.12 utt1: Which is probably pretty nice,  /
qy^d          B.12 utt2: {C but } I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high. /  

nn          A.13 utt1: No,  /
sd^e          A.13 utt2: actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either. /  

br^m          B.14 utt1:  There's no <laughter> sales tax either? /  

nn          A.15 utt1: No,  /
sd^e          A.15 utt2: what there is, is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1: The only problem is I work in Massachusetts,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C so } [ they -- +   

b          B.18 utt1:  Right. /

%          A.21 utt3: {D well, } {D you know, } we, - /
sd          A.21 utt4: it's only a state tax here, no local. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  ((We've)) got a five percent sales tax. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.25 utt1: {C But, } {F uh, } the problem is that [ so + ] I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here. /  

b^r          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1: {C But, } at least on things like stock options and things like that, they don't tax me. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {C So } that's not too bad. /  

aa          B.30 utt1: No,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay [ [ a, + a whole, ] + {F uh, } just too much ] tax.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: I worked in a factory, {F uh, } last summer  /
sd          B.30 utt4: {C and, } on the average, I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes  /
sv          B.30 utt5: {C and } I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that.  /
sd          B.30 utt6: {E I mean, } I don't utilize [ all, + {D you know, } {A it really, } any ] government welfare services.  /
sd          B.30 utt7: Of course, I drive on the roads  /
sd          B.30 utt8: {C and } I, {D you know, } went to the schools and stuff,  /
sv          B.30 utt9: {C but } I really feel [ that, + that ] I'm just getting overtaxed. /  

sd          A.31 utt1: {F Oh, } [ [ I, + {E I mean, } I, ] + I'd ] consider twenty percent lucky because [ just on, + {E I mean, } {D you know, } when you figure out just on ] feds, {D you know, } I actually hit the thirty-one bracket --   

b          B.32 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- # this year, # which was no fun. /

+          B.36 utt1:  that's ] not any fun. /  

b          A.37 utt1: Right,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C and } also, {D you know, } then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A --   

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- which is taxes --

+          A.41 utt1: -- where ((you)), - /
sv          A.41 utt2: most people forget about them, because [ you've g-, + {D you know, } you can't ] always get your F I C A back at the # end of the year. # /  

b^r          B.42 utt1:  # Right. # /  

sd          A.43 utt1: [ [ {C But, } + {C so, } ] + {D you know, } {C and then, } ] {D you know, } {D like } a five percent surtax, I'm paying forty percent tax. /  

b          B.44 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.44 utt2: which is just outrageous  /
%          B.44 utt3: {C and } a lot of it, - /
sv          B.44 utt4: {C and } if you look at the way the government is run these days, it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste. /  

b          A.45 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {D well, } [ [ I, + I mean, ] + I think ] [ there's some people, + there, [ y-, + ] certainly are some things ] where you need infrastructure  /

sv          A.47 utt2: ((there are)) things government does better, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.47 utt3: I ((think)) government does a better space program --   

b^r          B.48 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.49 utt1: -- than you're going to get out of private individuals,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {C but, } {D you know, } I think, {D you know, } you look at things like, {D you know, } tax subsidies to tobacco farmers --   

b^r          B.50 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- because Jesse Helms wants it that way  /

+          A.53 utt1: {D You know, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ] just tremendous amounts of, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.53 utt2: so much of it, is now just going to service debt or --   

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sv          A.55 utt3: [ they are, + they are ] a fat.  /
sv          A.55 utt4: {D You know, } I think the military is really fat.  /
sv          A.55 utt5: I think that a lot of [ the, + the ] H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them. /  

aa          B.56 utt1: Right.  /
sv          B.56 utt2: [ The-, + there ] is just way too much bureaucracy  /
sv          B.56 utt3: {C and } so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running, keep the paper shuffling around --   

%          A.57 utt1:  {D You know, } {D like } we, -/  

+          B.58 utt1:  -- instead of real, {D you know, } good programs. /  

aa          A.59 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.59 utt2: {E I mean, } [ we, + we ] spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals  /

aa          B.60 utt1: Right,  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {C and } a lot of it's feeding that.  /
sd          B.60 utt3: [ [ [ Just, + I just, ] + I really, ] + {A especially in the election year, } {E I mean, } I'm really ] thinking a lot <laughter> about this, the economy and questions like that [ and, + and ] just the whole, - /
sv          B.60 utt4: it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as [ the economy, + {F uh, } the government ] goes and [ our, + our ] whole economy in general  /
sv          B.60 utt5: {C and } our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens  /
sd          B.60 utt6: {C and } especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures, {F uh, } beyond what any other President since World War Two has done  /

sv          A.71 utt1: {C But, } {D you know, } the other thing is, it's tricky, though,  /
