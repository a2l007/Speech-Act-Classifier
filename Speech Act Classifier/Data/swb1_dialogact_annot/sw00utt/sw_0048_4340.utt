qw          A.1 utt1:  What kind of crime do you think,  {F uh, } is the most  prevalent in our society? /  

sv          B.2 utt1: {D Oh, } boy, probably, {F uh, } robberies, people stealing from each other. /  

qy^d          A.3 utt1: Such as New York City <laughter>? /  

qy^h          B.4 utt1: <Laughter> Is that what happens up there a lot?  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {F Uh, } [ [ th-, + that, ] + that's ] mostly what I hear, ((though)), is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen.  /
sv          B.4 utt3: That's the most prevalent crime. {F Uh, } [ the ones that really, + {D you know, } the ones that really ] add up after a while, I guess, {D you know, } [ from, s-, + far as ] insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.  /
sv          B.4 utt4: {D You know, } everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually. /  

b          A.5 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.5 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] wonder [ if, + {F uh, } if ] drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, {E I mean, } so many people use it,  /
h          A.5 utt3: {C and } even though just using is not really, - /
sd          A.5 utt4: {E I mean } it is a crime, /  

aa          B.6 utt1: {F Oh, } {D well, } yeah,  /
sd          B.6 utt2: [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] is a crime.  /

sd          B.6 utt4: {F uh, } speeding is a crime <laughter>. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } that's true. /

+          A.11 utt1: -- and, {F uh, } drug use,  /
sv          A.11 utt2: {D well, } {D actually } drug use is probably a misdemeanor,  /
qw          A.11 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } [ what kind, + what kind, ] - /
qy          A.11 utt4: [ have you been, + {F uh, } have you been ] the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything? /  

sd          B.12 utt1: {D Well, } [ I've, + {F uh, } I've ] been caught with marijuana before,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C so } I guess that was a crime.  /
sd          B.12 utt3: I got a year's probation for that,  /
%          B.12 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } -/

%          A.17 utt1:  I, -/  

sv          B.18 utt1: {F Uh, } when I think of crime, I think of stuff [ that, + that ] affects other people like people getting, {D you know, } killed or raped.  /
sv          B.18 utt2: I think rape is one of the worst crimes <laughter>. /  

aa          A.19 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.19 utt2: I think it is.  /
sv          A.19 utt3: [ I, + ] in some ways, it's almost worse than murder. /  

b          B.20 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.20 utt2: it's very degrading -- /

+@          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  -- {D you know, } {E I mean, } it is a rather final solution,  ((though)) <laughter>. /  

aa          B.26 utt1: Yeah,  /
aa          B.26 utt2: right,  /
sd          B.26 utt3: [ once, + once ] a person's, {D you know, } gone, then it's, <laughter> - /
sd          B.26 utt4: {C but } the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life, {D you know. } /  

aa          A.27 utt1: Yes.  /
qw          A.27 utt2: [ What, + what ] do you think [ is, + {F uh, } is ] an appropriate, {F uh, } punishment for [ some of the various, + ] {D you know, } [ such as, + things such as ] rape [ or, + or, ] {F uh, } murder --   

sv          B.28 utt1:  {D Well } --    

+          A.29 utt1:  -- or something like that. /  

+          B.30 utt1: -- [ for, + for ] a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is, - /
sv          B.30 utt2: it's a <breathing> pretty good thing. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:  I agree with that. /  

sv          B.32 utt1: [ They, + they ] have that down here in Florida still.  /

qy          B.34 utt1: {F Oh, } do they?  /
%          B.34 utt2: Yeah,  /
sv          B.34 utt3: [ I think, + I think ] that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy  /
sv          B.34 utt4: {C and, } I guess usually [ they're, + they're ] always sure they <laughter> got the right guy,  /

aa          B.36 utt2: so do I. /  

sv          A.37 utt1: [ I think, + [ I, + I ] think ] it [ should take, + from conviction to execution should take ] no longer than a year. /

sv          A.43 utt1: You do the best you can to make it perfect, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.43 utt2: [ you, + you ] go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.45 utt1: {C But, } I think you have to accept some of the errors.  /
sv          A.45 utt2: I think that murder itself would decrease significantly [ if, + if ] there was a credible punishment, {F uh, } for murderers. /  

b          B.46 utt1: {F Um, } yeah,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: I don't know if it would or not though.  /
sv          B.46 utt3: [ I, + I ] don't think it's [ a, + so much of a ] deterrent [ as, + as ] it is [ [ a, + a good, ] + {F uh, } a good ] way for vengeance, {D you know, } for the relatives [ and, + and ] family members,  /
qy          B.46 utt4: you know what I mean? /

sd          B.62 utt5: they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught.  /  

b          A.63 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.63 utt2: generally the crimes of passion and things like that, {F uh, } are not premeditated. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Right. /  

h          A.65 utt1: {E I mean, } they can be,  /
