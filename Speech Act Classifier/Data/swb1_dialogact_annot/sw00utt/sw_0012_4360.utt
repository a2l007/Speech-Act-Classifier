sv          B.2 utt1:  <Static> {D Well, } I would say as, far as social changes go, {F uh, }  I think families were more together.  /
sv          B.2 utt2:  [ They, + they ] did more things  together. /  

b          @A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } they ate dinner at the table together.  /
sv          B.4 utt2:  {F Uh, } the  parents usually took out [ time, + {F uh, } {D you know, } more time ] than  they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family  activity. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } although I'm not a mother, [ I, + I ] still think that,  {F uh, } a lot has changed since ten years ago.  /

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.11 utt1:  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> {C but } I do agree that, {F uh, } generally  [ it's, + society ] has sort of, {F uh, } let's see, rushed everything  ahead. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sv          A.13 utt3:  In other words, they just  prioritize their lives differently.  /
sv          A.13 utt4: {C But } I think that has a lot to  do with economic situation. /

h          A.17 utt1:  {F Um. }  It depends.  /
sv          A.17 utt2:  {F Uh, } it's hard to say because I think  people were busy ten twenty <laughter> years ago too. /

aa          B.30 utt1:  Yes. /

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {C And } now, {F uh, } it's pretty much an economic necessity [ [ of, +  for most, ] + in most ] places for both parents to work. /  

qy          B.34 utt1:  Do you think it's an economic [ c-, + necessity ]  /

sv          A.53 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } [ I + <sigh> I ] tend to think that it's less  those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group  that is just trying to survive. /  

qy^d          B.54 utt1:  [ Yo-, + {C so } you ] think it's, - /

%          A.61 utt1:  {D So. } - /
sd          A.61 utt2: {E I mean } I have met people [ [ that, + {F uh, } both  that, ] + <sigh> that ] just want to maintain [ a, + the ] standard of  living and those [ that, + that ] really need the job. /  

b          B.62 utt1: Okay.  /
sd          B.62 utt2: {C And then, } sometimes [ I, + I ] often, {F uh, } find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. [ Yo-, + ] a microwave, a V C R, a answering machine --   

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
