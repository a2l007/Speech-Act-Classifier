sd          B.3 utt1: {F Um, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] latest one I've seen, {F uh, } had to do with [ [ a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the, ] + {F uh, } basically a ] manhunt, {F um, }  /
sd          B.3 utt2: {C and } [ it was, + {F uh, } it was ] called MANHUNTER, actually.  /
sd          B.3 utt3: {F Uh, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] guy, {F uh, } apparently had [ a, + a, ] mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. {F Uh, } just, {F uh, } kill them [ with, + with ] as much blood [ and, + and ] guts as possible. /  

ba          A.4 utt1:  {F Oh, } how awful <laughter>. /  

sv          B.5 utt1: [ It <laughter> was true, + it was truly awful. ]  /
sd          B.5 utt2: It was not one that I picked,  /
sd          B.5 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] did show [ [ some, + some, ] + {F uh, } some ] interesting things about the F B I  /
sd          B.5 utt4: {C because } [ they were + [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] characters [ trying, + trying ] to get him were ] F B I people  /
sd          B.5 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ of the, + of the ] few good things that were in it, it did show, {F uh, } a lot about the F B I. About the training, [ and, + and ] how they go through training and how they try [ to, + to ] develop, {F uh, } {F uh, } a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that.  /
sd          B.5 utt6: {C And } [ it was, + {F uh, } {F uh, } it was ] pretty telling about [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] F B I and their procedures. /  

sd          A.6 utt1: I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction. /  

b          B.7 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.7 utt2: [ I, + I ] imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, {F uh, } going, I guess. /  

aa          A.8 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.8 utt2: {D well, } they keep it rather secretive,  /

sd          A.10 utt2: {D well } [ two, + two ] of them actually.  /
sd          A.10 utt3: {F Uh, } the RAIN MAN was one. /  

sv          B.11 utt1:  {F Oh } that was great one. /  

aa          A.12 utt1: Wasn't that fabulous,  /
sd          A.12 utt2: [ and, +   

sd          B.13 utt1:  {F Oh, } I loved it. /

sd          B.15 utt1: {D You know, } I haven't seen that one yet,  /
sv          B.15 utt2: {C and } I need to go see it. /  

aa          A.16 utt1:  {F Oh, } you need to see that. /  

b          B.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.18 utt1: That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people.    

b          B.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.20 utt1: Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black  /
sd          A.20 utt2: {C and } this all took place in the South. /  

ba          B.21 utt1:  {F Oh } my. -/  

sv          A.22 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } normally never the twain shall meet. /

aa          A.24 utt1: Yes,  /
aa          A.24 utt2: right,  /
sv          A.24 utt3: {C and, } {F um, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] really was a fantastic movie.  /
sv          A.24 utt4: The acting was phenomenal. /  

qy^g          B.25 utt1: {D Well } [ as, it, + as I recall it ] got some Academy Awards, didn't it. /  

ny          A.26 utt1: {F Oh } yes,  /
sd^e          A.26 utt2: Jessica Tandy won best actress  /

b          B.27 utt1: {F Oh } yeah,  /
sd          B.27 utt2: that's right.  /
sv          B.27 utt3: [ It, + it ] might have one best picture, too. /  

aa          A.28 utt1: Yes  /

aa          A.28 utt3: yes  /
sd          A.28 utt4: it did. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.30 utt1: Just as RAIN MAN, {F uh, } with Dustin Hoffman,   

%          B.31 utt1:  That was, -/  

+          A.32 utt1:  {F uh, } [ that, + that ] was tremendous and Tom Cruise. /  

b          B.33 utt1: yeah,  /
sv          B.33 utt2: [ I, + I ] think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms [ of, + {F uh, } of ] how to act from Dustin Hoffman,  /
%          B.33 utt3: {C but, } {F uh. } -/  

aa          A.34 utt1: Yes,  /
sd          A.34 utt2: {F uh, } {F oh, } [ that was, + that was, ] {F uh, } what [ the, + much of the ] hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman. /  

b          B.35 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.35 utt2: it must have been great just being with him [ on, + on ] a daily basis and seeing how he prepares [ for his, + for his ] lines and all that stuff. /  

b          A.36 utt1: Yeah  /
sd          A.36 utt2: {C and } a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati.   

b          B.37 utt1:  Oh.  /  

+          A.38 utt1: Which is just forty-five miles [ from, + from ] [ where I am, + where I actually live ] in a suburb of Dayton. /  

qy          B.39 utt1: [ Is, + is ] the Kmart there?  <laughter>. /  

na          A.40 utt1: {F Oh, } <laughter> we do have Kmart here,  /
o          A.40 utt2: you better believe it.  /
qy          A.40 utt3: Isn't there a Kmart everywhere? /  

sv          B.41 utt1: [ That was, + that was ] so funny,  /
sd          B.41 utt2: he had to, - /
qy          B.41 utt3: {E or } was it Kmart. /  

ny          A.42 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.43 utt1:  He had to buy his underwear at Kmart. /  

aa          A.44 utt1:  Right,  /
aa^r          A.44 utt2:  right  /
aa          A.44 utt3: yeah. /  

sv          B.45 utt1: That was hilarious.  /
sd          B.45 utt2: [ [ [ [ The, + the, ] + I guess the, ] + the first, ] + the first, ] {F uh, } scene in that movie that really got my attention, {F uh, } concerning [ the, + the ] disease and all that was when he, {F uh, } dropped [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } the toothpicks, /  

b          A.46 utt1:  {F Oh } yes. /  

sd          B.47 utt1: {C and } he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image. /  

b^r          A.48 utt1:  Yes,  /
b^r          A.48 utt2: yes. /  

sv          B.49 utt1:  Unbelievable. /  

sd          A.50 utt1: {D Well, } {D you know } there are people, {F uh, } referred to as savants also,   

b          B.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.52 utt1: {F uh, } who can do most phenomenal things  /
sd          A.52 utt2: {C and } everyone feels they are totally retarded. /  

b          B.53 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.53 utt2: {D wel-, } {C because } that's the way [ they, + they ]  might seem outwardly, /  

aa          A.54 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.55 utt1:  {C but, } boy there's a lots going on in there <laughter>. /  

sv          A.56 utt1:  It's amazing <laughter>. /  

b          B.57 utt1: Yeah,  /
b^r          B.57 utt2: yeah  /
sv          B.57 utt3: {C and } [ [ [ I, + the, ] + the, ] + I think ] [ the, + the ] best thing about RAINMAN was [ the, + {F uh, } the ] way that they put together [ the, + the ] real awfulness [ [ of the, + of the, ] + of the ] disease,   

aa          A.58 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.59 utt1: only,  /
sv          B.59 utt2: [ {C an, } + {C and then } ] they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.59 utt3: [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] you need [ to, + to ] work with it, {F uh, } {D you know, } certainly [ on, + on ] a daily basis but [ then ag-, + then again ] work with it toward a good end.    

aa          A.60 utt1:  Yes  /
%          A.60 utt2: {C and } the, -/  

+          B.61 utt1: [ Not, + not ] toward winning in Las Vegas, for example. /  

b          A.62 utt1: Right,  /
sd          A.62 utt2: {D well } the warmth that developed between them  /
sv          A.62 utt3: {C and } again it, I think was a picture of relationships. /  

b          B.63 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.64 utt1: Again the relationship, {F uh, } between the two, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } never would have occurred, {F uh, } by accident. /  

aa          B.65 utt1: Right,  /
aa^r          B.65 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.65 utt3: [ I was, + {F uh, } I was ] so impressed with that movie  /
sd          B.65 utt4: I saw it three times. /  

bh          A.66 utt1:  Did you. /  

sd          B.67 utt1: [ I can, + I can ] [ se-, + tell ] you, {F oh, } so much about that movie, just because [ it, + it ] really [ rang, + {F uh, } rang ] a lot of [ my, + {F uh, } my ] personal background.  /
sd          B.67 utt2: [ I, + I ] have [ a, + a ] brother myself [ that's, + that's ] older  /
sd          B.67 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } he's not, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.67 utt4: [ nothing, + nothing, ] of course, serious is wrong with him  /
sd          B.67 utt5: [ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] we have gone through [ these, + these ] lapses [ of, + of ] a relationship,   

b          A.68 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.69 utt1: [ somewhat, + sometimes, ]  /
sd          B.69 utt2: {C and then, } {D you know, } {F uh, } [ [ for, + for, ] + for ] no real, {D you know, } direct reason, I guess, {F uh, } [ we, + we ] get into, {F uh, } {F uh, } a really good relationship for a while and then, {D you know, } back and forth  /
sd          B.69 utt3: {C so } [ I, + I ] was really able [ to, + to ] relate to [ the, + the ] relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers.  /
sv          B.69 utt4: That was neat. /  

b          A.70 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
ba          A.70 utt2: {D Well } that's tremendous,  /
sv          A.70 utt3: [ that, + it's ] good because it does make you think, about your own family. /  

aa          B.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.71 utt2: a lot. /  

sd          A.72 utt1: {C And } {D see } it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother. /  

aa          B.73 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.73 utt2: No question,  /
sd          B.73 utt3: [ [ [ he, + the, ] + he was, ] + he's ] one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that.  /
sd          B.73 utt4: He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things. /  

b          A.74 utt1:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /  

sd          B.75 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } [ it, + it ] was like pulling teeth to go get him [ to, + to ] see it  /
sd          B.75 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } {F oh } boy.  [ [ He was, + {F uh, } {F uh, } he, ] + he gave ] [ the, + the ] best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN.  /
sd          B.75 utt3: {E I mean } he certainly didn't, - /
sd          B.75 utt4: he only saw it one time,  /
sd          B.75 utt5: {C and } he didn't go back for more,  /
sd          B.75 utt6: {C but, } {F uh, } [ he, + he ] said he enjoyed it  /
%          B.75 utt7: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] -/  

sd          A.76 utt1:  {D Well } he at least saw it one time <laughter>. /  

b          B.77 utt1: Yeah,  /
b^r          B.77 utt2: yeah,  /
%          B.77 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] he really, - /
h          B.77 utt4: I don't know,  /
sd          B.77 utt5: [ he, + he's ] kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway.  /

aa          B.81 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd         A.82 utt1: He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, {F uh, } {F uh, } with the kinds of problems that he had. /
