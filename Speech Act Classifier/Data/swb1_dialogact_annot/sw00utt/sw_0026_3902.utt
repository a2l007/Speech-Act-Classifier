sv          B.16 utt2: [ I th-, + I still think ] it is worth it [ if you, + if you ] had a good nursing home  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.21 utt1: -- letting strangers in and things like this,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: {C but } they were very fortunate.  /
sd          A.21 utt3: It's a small town  /
sd          A.21 utt4: {C and } she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's  /
sd          A.21 utt5: {C and --   

ba          B.22 utt1: {F Oh, } {D well } that's good. /

sd          A.25 utt4: I don't know how much longer this can last  /
sd          A.25 utt5: {C and } at that point because he requires round the clock. - /
sd          A.25 utt6: He can't do anything without her.  /
sd          A.25 utt7: He doesn't know when to take his medicine  /
sv          A.25 utt8: {C and } it's really sad  /
sd          A.25 utt9: {C and } I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.25 utt10: my brother's are not interested in helping me  /
sd          A.25 utt11: {C so } I would have to move him down here.  /
%          A.25 utt12: That way, - /
sd          A.25 utt13: I want to see the nursing home.  If I have to put him into one.  /
sd          A.25 utt14: {D You know, } where I can go see it.  /
sd          A.25 utt15: [ I, + I'd ] be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.  /

b          B.26 utt1: # {F Oh, } why # yeah.  /
sv          B.26 utt2: I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas. /  

aa          A.27 utt1: Yes.  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C And } some of them are limited care too where people can do, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.27 utt3: {D like } they have apartment styles,  /
sd          A.27 utt4: but that wouldn't work for him.  /
sv          A.27 utt5: I think he is beyond that.  /
sd          A.27 utt6: Where if you need help you can get it,  /
sd          A.27 utt7: {C but } basically people kind of have a small apartment  /
sd          A.27 utt8: {C and } doctor's are available if they need them. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  # [ I, + I ] # --   

%          A.29 utt1:  # {C And } allows, # -/  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- know a lady that lives in a place similar --    

b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- to that in Austin. /  

b          A.33 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {D Well, } the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.  /
sv          A.33 utt3: Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is  /
%          A.33 utt4: {C but, } -/  

sv          B.34 utt1: {C And } the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, [ you just practically have, + {D well } you have ] to be a pauper. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.36 utt1: [ It, + it ] takes every penny.  /
sv          B.36 utt2: They want you to spend every dime you have --   

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.38 utt1: -- before the government will pay for [ your + your ] care. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {C And } that's the sad part about it. /  

b          A.41 utt1: Yeah.  /
%          A.41 utt2: I, {F uh, } - /
%          A.41 utt3: yeah,  /
sv          A.41 utt4: {C and } I think a lot of people who do it now. - /
sv          A.41 utt5: In Colorado it's interesting.  /
sd          A.41 utt6: I talked to my mother.  /
sd          A.41 utt7: They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.  /
sd          A.41 utt8: {C And } my mother could make it on that.  /
sd          A.41 utt9: What she probably would do is disburse the money to me  /
sd          A.41 utt10: {C and then } I would send it back to her  /
sd          A.41 utt11: {C so } that's what would happen. /  

b          B.42 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.42 utt2: I think that's what most people do.  /
sv          B.42 utt3: You just have to give [ it, + everything ] away. /  

aa          A.43 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.43 utt2: It's # unfortunate. # /  

sd          B.44 utt1: # [ I, + I ] # work at a brokerage firm  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C and } I have seen so many people that just have to gift, {D you know, } their belongings --   

b          A.45 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home. /  

b          A.47 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          A.47 utt2: It's frightening.  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C And } I guess, {F uh, } I don't know how old you are.  /
sd          A.47 utt4: I'm forty-six.  /
sd          A.47 utt5: {D You know, } we're the generation moving into this  /
sd          A.47 utt6: {C and } I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us.

sd          B.52 utt2: we don't have any children.  /
sd          B.52 utt3: Everybody that has, has them later in life. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.54 utt1: {D So, } [ my, + my ] mother and my father are in their late sixties.  /
sv          B.54 utt2: {C So, } {E I mean, } they're not <laughter> --   

b          A.55 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- that far away. /  

sv          A.57 utt1: I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise  /
sd          A.57 utt2: {C and } he's still living at home  /
sd          A.57 utt3: {C and } I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know. /  

%          A.59 utt1: {C And so, } it's kind of, - /
sv          A.59 utt2: you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,  /
sv          A.59 utt3: {C but } [ it, + something ] will have to change as more and more of us get older.  /
sd          A.59 utt4: {F Uh, } luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, [ I, + {F uh } {D you know, } I ] would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.  /
sd          A.59 utt5: # {C But } # --

sv          A.63 utt2: most aren't.  /
sv          A.63 utt3:  That's the problem. /  

sv          B.64 utt1: {C And } that's the bad thing.  /
sd          B.64 utt2: I would hate to have lived so long.  /
sd          B.64 utt3: She lived by herself.  /
sd          B.64 utt4: My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one.    

ba          A.65 utt1:  That's incredible. /
