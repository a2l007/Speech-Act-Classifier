sd          A.1 utt1: {D Well, } we, [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, {F uh, } {D you know, } keep track of, {F uh, } daily finances.  /
sd          A.1 utt2: {F Uh, } [ the, + ] {F uh, } way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, {D you know, } checkbooks and all this kind of thing  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C and } we kept that going for about a month  /
sd          A.1 utt4: {C and } it became so onerous that we gave up on it <laughter>. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
ba          B.2 utt2:  That sounds about right <laughter>. /  

sd          A.3 utt1: {D You know, } {C so, } {F uh, } the only thing [ we're, + {D you know, } that we do ] now is, {F uh, } I keep [ a, + a ] little spread sheet of, {F uh, } what I call the net worth calculation which is just [ the, + the ] present value of various kinds of investments and so worth.  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } I only update that, {F oh } I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in.    

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1: {D You know. } Just to see whether or not we're [ falling, + {D you know, } getting ] ahead, falling behind or staying even or what. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.7 utt1: {F Uh, } that's really about, {D you know, } the extent [ of, + {F uh, } of ] the kind of, {F uh, } financial score keeping that we're doing. /  

%          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh } # <laughter>. #  /

sd          B.10 utt1: {D Well } it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, {F uh, } like most teachers, I'm laid off  /

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.14 utt1: {C So } [ it's a lot, + it's very hard ] on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances. /  

b^r          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C but } ] I know how much I have to bring in a month <laughter>.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C And } that's about it.  /
sd          B.16 utt3: That's about as far as we go.  /
sd          B.16 utt4: {C And then } anything extra is, {D you know, } more or less split up between all of us.   

b^r          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1: And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day <laughter>. /

sd          B.22 utt1: {C So, } {F uh, } right now, [ we're on, + we get ] [ f-, + {D you know, } aid from ] the state at this point because there's no other way to do it.  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {C And } my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support <laughter>. /  

ba          A.23 utt1:  Oh dear. /  

sd          B.24 utt1: {C So } right now I know what I'm getting from the state  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, {F uh, } {D you know, } try to work as many days as possible.    

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1: Any time they call me in.  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C But } I still have to figure out.  /
sd          B.26 utt3: If I work too many days, then I lose all my state aid  /
sd          B.26 utt4: {C and } <laughter> if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C and } it's like a juggling act every single month. /  

b^r          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1: {D Like } this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in  /
sd          B.28 utt2: {C but } they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  I see. /  

sd          B.30 utt1: {C So, } {D you know, } the four days before, they only have a four day week -- /  

b          A.31 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          B.32 utt1: -- # {C and } they # usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in # <laughter>. # /

sd          B.38 utt2: My kids are in Boy Scouts  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C so } trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts  /
sd          B.38 utt4: {C because } every penny I bring in is ten percent to me.  /
sd          B.38 utt5: {C So } <laughter> it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit.  /
sd          B.38 utt6: {C But, } {D you know, } we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  /
sv          B.38 utt7: I guess we're in the situation that a lot of [ am-, + middle-class Americans ] are in. /

sv          A.49 utt4: {C but } at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for [ a, + a ] budgetary thing [ than, + than ] most people probably [ ar-, + might ] be.
