sd          A.1 utt3: I lived in Germany  /
sd          A.1 utt4: {C and } in Germany they don't have the jury system.  /
sd          A.1 utt5: What they do is they have, {F uh, } three judges, basically.  /
sd          A.1 utt6: {C And } you get up there  /
sd          A.1 utt7: {C and } the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence  /
sd          A.1 utt8: {C and } your defense attorney presents their evidence  /
sd          A.1 utt9: {C and } those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. /  

sv          B.2 utt1: <Sneezing> [ [ Ou-, + ou-, ] + our ] judicial system is in such total chaos. /  

x          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

sv          B.4 utt1: I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow <lipsmack> take the money out of it.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {E I mean, } when you have a man that's signed [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] statement saying he's guilty, - /

sd          A.9 utt2: {E I mean, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I would have to look at it.  /
sv          A.9 utt3: [ I-, + if ] they did it with [ the, + {F uh, } just the ] judges,  the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C because } the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures,  /
sd          A.9 utt5: they know what's good and what isn't,  /
sd(^q)          A.9 utt6: they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,  /
^q          A.9 utt7: you can't use this as, {F uh, } evidence, {D you know, } because it was either illegally obtained or whatever  /
sd          A.9 utt8: {C and, } {D you know, } you wouldn't have this, {F uh, } {F uh, } theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it [ to the, + to the ] jury  /
sd(^q)          A.9 utt9: {C and then } the judge says, {F oh, } no,  /
^q          A.9 utt10: [ d-, + disregard ] that.  /
o          A.9 utt11: Come on,  /
sv          A.9 utt12: any jury's not going to  disregard the evidence, {D you know } <laughter>. /  

aa          B.10 utt1: {F Uh, } that's true.  /
sv          B.10 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  That may very well be. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  [ I, + I ] hold it in the utmost contempt. /

sv          B.14 utt2: <breathing> they're not aimed at the criminal.  /
sv          B.14 utt3: The judicial system is aimed at the citizens  /
sd          B.14 utt4: {C because } you and I, we have work schedules,  /
sd          B.14 utt5: we can be called at work,  /
sd          B.14 utt6: we have Social Security numbers,  /

sd          B.14 utt9: then we have checkbooks.  /
sv          B.14 utt10: Criminals have none of these things.  /
sv          B.14 utt11: They're real difficult to catch,  /
sv          B.14 utt12: {C and } if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas [ us, + we ] write a check. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qh          B.16 utt1:  {C So } where do you think they target their efforts? /

%          A.17 utt2: ((You d-)), -/  

sv          B.18 utt1:  They target their efforts toward the citizens --    

qo          A.19 utt1:  {D Well, }     

+          B.20 utt1:  -- not the criminals. /

sd          B.26 utt2: I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about, - /
sv          B.26 utt3: I think, to begin with, [ you would h-, + you would have, ] - /
sv          B.26 utt4: {D like, } here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C yet, } you go out on the streets  /
sd          B.26 utt6: {C and } they're giving speeding tickets. /

sv          A.29 utt1: {D Well, } {D you know, } {F uh, } talking about the lawyers, {D you know } what might very well [ do, + {F uh, } cause ] [ a, + {F uh, } a ] drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases.  /
sv          A.29 utt2: It's kind of like [ do it, + do it ] in the similar vein [ similar, + like, ] {F uh, } V C R or television repair.  /
sd(^q)          A.29 utt3: If you take your T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, {D well, } I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars,  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C and } if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.  /
sd          A.29 utt5: [ He, + he ] repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars.  /

sd          A.29 utt7: maybe it's a blown fuse,  /
sd          A.29 utt8: takes him two minutes,  /
sd          A.29 utt9: he fixes it,  /
sd          A.29 utt10: he still charges you that hundred dollars.  /
sv          A.29 utt11: {C So, } maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, {D you know, } whether it's a murder case or [ [ a, + {D you know, } a civil, ] + {F uh, } somebody suing somebody else, ] you get X dollars for that case  /
sd          A.29 utt12: {C and } that's it. /

%          A.31 utt1:  None of this, -/  

+          B.32 utt1: I firmly believe in that  /
qy          B.32 utt2: {C because } when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? /  

ny          A.33 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /
