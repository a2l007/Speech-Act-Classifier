sv          A.1 utt1: -ing seems to be [ a, + a ] topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, {F uh, } catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two <laughter>.  /
sv          A.1 utt2: {C And } we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.  /
sv          A.1 utt3: {F Uh, } it does seem to be a lot of habits to break.  /
sd          A.1 utt4: I, {F uh, } wasn't raised as a kid on it,  /
sd          A.1 utt5: {C but } my kids are  /
sd          A.1 utt6: {C and so } [ they, + they ] tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,  /
sd          A.1 utt7: {C and } we were doing all right there until, {F uh, } the price dropped out  /
sd          A.1 utt8: <breathing> {C and } they weren't worth anything anymore. /  

b          B.2 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

%          A.3 utt1: {C And } we <breathing>, - /
sd          A.3 utt2: it took us, <lipsmack> almost a year to get a garbage sack full.  /
sd          A.3 utt3: We just don't drink that many.  /
sd          A.3 utt4: {C So } as far as at home use, {F uh, } we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something  /
sd          A.3 utt5: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.3 utt6: at the time it was still, {F oh, } about forty or fifty cents a pound,  /
sd          A.3 utt7: {C and } we came out with about a dollar <laughter>,  /
sv          A.3 utt8: it just really wasn't worth it. /  

bf          B.4 utt1: {C And } a lot of hassle all year round  /
bf          B.4 utt2: {C and } cans laying, -/  

aa          A.5 utt1:   Yeah. /  

b^m          B.6 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          A.7 utt1: {D So, } [ they, + they ] realized, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.7 utt2: {D well, } of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.  /
sd          A.7 utt3: [ That wasn't, + {F uh, } that was ] a big deal,  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C but } we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C and then, } {F uh, } T I started keeping up with, {F uh, } cans there,  /
sd          A.7 utt6: {C so } occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.  /
sd          A.7 utt7: Least it gets back into the system,  /
sd          A.7 utt8: {C but, } as far as a habit at the house, {F uh, } I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up.  /
qy          A.7 utt9: Have you all got the individual containers yet? /  

nn          B.8 utt1: <Lipsmack> No,  /
sd^e          B.8 utt2: I read in the paper this week where maybe, - /
h          B.8 utt3: I don't know if it [ w-, + was, ] - /
sd          B.8 utt4: I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time. /  

%          A.9 utt1:   {F Um. } /  

sd          B.10 utt1: {C But, } [ it, + it ] should be starting, I would stay probably in the next month [ if, + if ] everything goes that <breathing>, - /
sd          B.10 utt2: I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,  /
sd          B.10 utt3: I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything. /  

b          A.11 utt1: Right.  /
b          A.11 utt2: Yeah,  /
sv          A.11 utt3: it seemed like, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.11 utt4: [ if, + if ] I recall, it's been a long time.  /
sv          A.11 utt5: They're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.  /
sv          A.11 utt6: They were fine on the [ green, + big green containers ] -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.13 utt1: -- {C but, } {F uh, } seems like they said they were just going to have a bin  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C and } all different types would go in there  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and then } that they would sort it [ as -- +    

b          B.14 utt1:   Oh. /  

+          A.15 utt1: -- as ] needed.  /
sv          A.15 utt2: [ It, + it ] seemed that there was, - /
sd          A.15 utt3: at the time anyway, [ it, + ] the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that [ at, + at ] the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, {F uh, } those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting.  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C But } when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.15 utt5: the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C so } they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better [ than, + than ] --   

b          B.16 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.17 utt1: -- having a household try it.  /
h          A.17 utt2: {C But } [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sv          A.17 utt3: that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:   {D Well, } it would get messy, too. /  

b          A.19 utt1:   Yeah,  /
b^r          A.19 utt2: yeah, /  

sd          B.20 utt1: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] know other places when they recycle, they have to, {D like, } wash out their glass jars and --   

b          A.21 utt1:   Right. /  

+          B.22 utt1: -- whatnot. [ And, + ] {F uh, } which we're not in the habit of doing. /  

aa          A.23 utt1:   That's true. /  

sd          B.24 utt1: I was brought up, {F uh, } {D you know, } long time ago, that they didn't even have cans.  /
sd          B.24 utt2: They had bottles  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C and } you'd return them to the --   

b          A.25 utt1:   Right. /  

+          B.26 utt1: -- the grocery store  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } you'd get our money back  /
sv          B.26 utt3: {C and } [ that, + that ] was all well and good.  /
sd          B.26 utt4: They don't seem to still be doing that.  /
sv          B.26 utt5: If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,  /
sd          B.26 utt6: {C but, } I guess this day and age --   

b          A.27 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.28 utt1:   -- they don't. /  

^2          A.29 utt1: <Lipsmack> They don't do that.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: We live next to a set of railroad tracks  /
sv          A.29 utt3: {C and } it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to [ crash, + {D you know } --   

b          B.30 utt1:   Uh-huh.  /  

+          A.31 utt1: -- break ] them,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } they weren't that successful,  /
sd          A.31 utt3: {C so } there were a lot of bottles to be returned  /
sd          A.31 utt4: {C and } we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted --   

b          B.32 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.33 utt1:   -- for the day <laughter>  /
%          A.33 utt2: {C and, } -/  

b          B.34 utt1: Yeah,  /
%          B.34 utt2: {C and } they, {F uh, } p-, - /
sv          B.34 utt3: [ I, + I ] think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,  /
sv          B.34 utt4: they can get more somewhere else. /  

b          A.35 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: just a little bit of begging will <laughter>, -/  

%          B.36 utt1: {F Uh, } for a good, - /
b          B.36 utt2: right.  /
%          B.36 utt3: They're, - /
sv          B.36 utt4: the nickels, the dimes or what, I <laughter> suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, [ they, + the kids ] just don't seem [ to, + to ] care [ that, + that ] much about a small amount of money. /  

b          A.37 utt1: Right.  /
%          A.37 utt2: {D Well, } I wonder, /  

sd          B.38 utt1: {C But, } [ we, + we ] did buy a can crusher  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C and } we are crushing cans  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C and } when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,  /
sv          B.38 utt4: {C so } I would say --   

b          A.39 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.40 utt1: -- in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {F Uh, } it was just easier <breathing> to do that than to open a large <breathing> liter bottle and then have it go flat. /  

b          A.41 utt1:   Right,  /
b          A.41 utt2: yeah.  /  

sd          B.42 utt1: <Lipsmack> {C So } that's the main reason [ we're, + we, sort of are ] into cans <laughter> at this point rather than the liter bottles <laughter>. /  

qw          A.43 utt1:   Where do you take your cans?  /  

^h          B.44 utt1: {D Well, } as you say, it takes a while to build it up.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: Since we've had the crusher all summer, [ we + <breathing>, I guess we ] just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-, {F oh, } - /
sd          B.44 utt3: I think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to [ a, + a ] recycling place, probably at one of the li-, -/
