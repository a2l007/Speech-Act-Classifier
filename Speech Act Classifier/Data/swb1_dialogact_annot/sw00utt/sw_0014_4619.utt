sv          A.18 utt1: {C And } it seems, {F uh, } - /
h          A.18 utt2: {E I mean } [ the, + the ] environment there, I don't know too much about it  /
sv          A.18 utt3: {C but } [ it, + it ] seems nice enough.  /
sv          A.18 utt4: {F Uh, } [ it, + it's ] hard,  /
sd          A.18 utt5: at least half of the residents I would say are [ not, + not ] mentally sound.  /
sd          A.18 utt6: {C So } it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling [ to r-, + to retain, ] {F uh, } clarity, {D say, } {F uh, } # {D ((you know })). # /

sd          A.20 utt4: [ We, + {F uh, } she ] goes more often than I.  /
sd          A.20 utt5: We used to go [ once a month, + once every two months ] to visit some of the patients there.  /

sd          A.20 utt8: {C And, } {F uh, } there I would say it's the same thing.  /
sv          A.20 utt9: [ It's, + it's ] a [ nice, + {F uh, } relatively nice ] environment  /
sv          A.20 utt10: {C but } again, {F um, } it must be depressing for the people [ [ who, + who ] are, + who are ] just [ [ e-, + e-, ] + essentially ] not able to take care of themselves in their own house [ but, + but, ] [ certainly, + {F uh, } certainly ] [ [ [ [ have + ar-, ] + ar-, ] + are, ] + have ] retained all of their, {F uh, } mental skills and so on.  /

qy          B.21 utt1:  Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern? /  

na          A.22 utt1: I think, yeah,  /
sv^e          A.22 utt2: I think they're relatively [ re-, + respectful. ] {D Yeah } [ and, + and ] concerned [ that, + ] in as much as they can be.  /
sd          A.22 utt3: [ [ I, + I ] think sometimes, + {D you know, } I've noticed, ] {F uh, } [ people asking for, + {F uh, } some of the patients asking for ] things, {F uh, } just repetitively --    

b          B.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.24 utt1: -- [ and, + but ] things that are not reasonable, #  /

sv          A.26 utt2: I'm sure [ that the, + that [ the, + {F uh, } the ] ] staff [ l-, + learn ] what's normal for this person  /
sv          A.26 utt3: {C and so } it looks to me like maybe their not catering to  this person's needs is really because this person [ is just, + {D you know, } is just ] in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.27 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          B.27 utt2: [ It, + it's ] possible,  /
sv          B.27 utt3: I was thinking also that [ there'd be, + there could be ] a fair burn out factor --   

b          A.28 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.29 utt1: -- {F um, } in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need. /  

b^r          A.30 utt1: Yeah.  /
sd          A.30 utt2: I'll tell you one thing though [ [ that'll, + that, ] + that ] [ I, + I ] saw that was really nice.  /
sd          A.30 utt3: We saw a husband and wife,  /
sd          A.30 utt4: we used to see a husband and wife in there, {F uh, } together  /
sd          A.30 utt5: {C and } they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were  /
sd          A.30 utt6: {C but } these two were. /  

b          B.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.32 utt1: {C And } when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house  -- /

aa          A.36 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.36 utt2: you walked in there  /
sd          A.36 utt3: {C and } it didn't look like, {F uh, } {D you know, } how, [ [ yo-, + you, ] + you ] walk into some rooms  /
sd          A.36 utt4: {C and } [ there's, + it's ] completely generic.  /
sd          A.36 utt5: There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person  /
sd          A.36 utt6: {C and } that's it.  /
sd          A.36 utt7: {C But } this room, on the other hand, {D you know, } they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that  /
sd          A.36 utt8: {C and } they had all their stuff from their house  /
sd          A.36 utt9: {C and } it looked like, {F uh, } [ [ i-, + i-, ] + it ] must have been, - /
sv          A.36 utt10: it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them  /
sv          A.36 utt11: {C and } it must also give them a sense of, {F uh, } {F uh, } security  [ [ [ and, + and, ] + {F uh, } and, ] + and, ] {D you know, } [ s-, + s-, ] # {F uh, } # -/  

b          B.37 utt1: # Yeah,  /

sd          B.37 utt3: I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who, {F uh, } were adequately deficient in their abilities, # {F uh } # --   

b          A.38 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.39 utt1: -- physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves.  /
sv          B.39 utt2: {C But } I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide, {F um, } a lot of social activities. /
