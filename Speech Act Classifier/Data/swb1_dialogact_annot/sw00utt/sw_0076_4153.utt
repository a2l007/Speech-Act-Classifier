sv          B.16 utt1: [ It, + it ] was a really good one,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } in fact, it worked out for us because [ my wife, + we ] kind of bartered.  /
sd          B.16 utt3: My wife did artwork for them  /
sd          B.16 utt4: [ {C and then, } + {D you know, } {C so } ] we got our day care free. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {C But } they didn't have enough teachers #  /

b^r          B.22 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1: The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough.  /

ny          A.33 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          B.34 utt1: {C Because } [ I'd think, + {D you know, } I think ] that's one thing that was important. /

sd          A.41 utt1: # It was just # the teachers themselves. /  

sv@          B.42 utt1: It sounds like to me [ your, + your ] concern would be to make sure that they are loving people.    

aa          A.43 utt1:  Right. /  

+@          B.44 utt1:  <Laughter>.

b          B.54 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          B.54 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, {D you know, } know all the technical stuff,  /
sv          B.54 utt3: {C but } if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good. /
