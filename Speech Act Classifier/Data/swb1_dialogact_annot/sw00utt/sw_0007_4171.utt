b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  They don't add anything.  /
qo          B.8 utt2:  What about you? /  

sd          A.9 utt1: {F Uh, } I work for a fairly large company.  /

sd          A.11 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } <breathing> we do have health insurance.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: We don't have four O [ k-, + one K ] plan, stuff like that,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {C but } we do have, {D like, } retirement.  /
sd          A.11 utt4: They kind of match up to, you,  /
sd          A.11 utt5: if you put six percent, they match up to six percent,  /
sd          A.11 utt6: {C and then } the rest is whatever you want to put in.  If you put more than that or something like that. /  

ba          B.12 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's a pretty good deal. /

sd          A.15 utt1: {D God, } I don't know.  /
sv          A.15 utt2: <laughter> It's probably a long time <laughter>.  /
sd          A.15 utt3: I'm sure it's not till {D like } twenty-five years, thirty years. /  

b          B.16 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive.  /
sd          B.16 utt3: It's {D like } hundred bucks [ a, + a ] month or something --   

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- for a family. /  

sd          A.19 utt1: {F Huh, } {D well, } I guess what we have is [ like a f-, + what they call a flex ] benefits plan where [ you, + you ] get {D like } a certain amount of dollars  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C and then } you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need.  /
sd          A.19 utt3: Otherwise [ you can, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> guess you can ] [ [ put, + also put money, ] + hold money ] back and then either use or lose it {A and that doesn't get taxed } or can just have that money, {D you know, } put in your paycheck. /  

b          B.20 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, {F uh, } they'll basically pay for, {F uh, } {D you know, } child care type, {F uh, } expenses.  /
sd          B.20 utt3: I [ can send in a, + {F uh, } can send in a ] request for payment  /

sv          B.20 utt5: That's pretty good, {D you know. }  /
sd          B.20 utt6: [ It's, + {F uh, } it ] saves a third off on taxes or something. /

sv          A.21 utt2: {D well, } it depends on which company you work for.  /
sd          A.21 utt3: I know that, {D like, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, {F uh, } {D you know, } {D [ you, + {F uh, } think you ] call it } plan D <laughter>.  /
sd          A.21 utt4: <+ another example like I guess it's alzheimer's +> Deductibles are really high,  /
sd          A.21 utt5: it's {D like } fifteen hundred dollars,  /
sv          A.21 utt6: {C but } if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because [ it's unlikely, + if you're [ f-, + relatively, ] {F uh, } healthy, then it's really unlikely ] that you'd use that [ much, + amount ] of money, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.21 utt7: {C So, } [ [ the-, + ] it, + {D ((you know)), } someone ] did start a cost benefit analysis,  /
sd          A.21 utt8: {C and } ends up the best is to take a high deductible [ and, + and ] take a loss, [ what-, + whatever ] ((it)) happens to be,  if you happen to be a healthy individual <laughter>. /  

b          B.22 utt1: Yeah,  /
