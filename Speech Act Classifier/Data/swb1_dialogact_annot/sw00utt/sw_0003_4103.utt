=========================================================================
  

sv          A.1 utt1:  {F Uh, } the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, {F uh, } long term financial plan and monthly budget.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  The only thing I do now is, {F uh, } put the data into Quicken.  /
qy^d          A.1 utt3:  I don't know if you are familiar with that. /  

ny          B.2 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.2 utt2: I have some friends of mine who use Quicken  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } I've considered using it once myself,  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C but } I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {C So } [ I, + I ] kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {F Um. }  I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, {D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } not bother to total it -- /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  -- {C and then } it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.  /
sv          A.7 utt2: {C So } it really helps with that. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {D well, } it's similar problems  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } we just have the one check book  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C and } we <inhaling> try to keep it up to date as much as possible  /
sd          B.8 utt5: {C and } occasionally we will get behind like you say  /
sd          B.8 utt6: {C but, } {F uh, } <inhaling> it doesn't really seem to be [ too, + too ] tight if we just remember to keep everything [ up, + up ] to date and balanced. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qo          B.10 utt1:  {D Well, } how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances? /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } {D actually } we haven't had to.  {F Uh, } until just recently.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  I guess we've got [ a, + a ] daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way  /
sd          A.11 utt3:  {C so } --   

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  -- we needed to start doing more of that just for, {F uh, } {D you know, } saving for college and things like that.  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  We [ tried a way, + try to put ] away two and four thousand a year just for that. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.14 utt2:  {D Well } that's pretty good if you can do that.  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  I know.  /
sd          B.14 utt4:  I have a daughter who's ten  /
sd          B.14 utt5: {C and } we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point  /
sd          B.14 utt6: {C but, } {F uh, } we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- for college,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C so } we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --   

%          A.17 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- in the fall  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and then } the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. /  

ba          A.19 utt1:  {F Um. }  Sounds good.  /
%          A.19 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.19 utt3: I guess [ we're, + we're ] just at the point, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.19 utt4: my wife worked until we had a family  /
sd          A.19 utt5: {C and then, } {D you know, } now we're just going on  the one income  /
sv          A.19 utt6: {C so } it's --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  -- a lot more interesting trying to, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.21 utt2: find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, {F uh, } do it.  /
sd          A.21 utt3:  {D You know, } kind of enforce the savings. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } it will be interesting to see (( )). /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {D Well } our situation is just [ a little bit, + kind of the opposite ] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, {F uh, } took on a full time job, {D well } almost full time. /  

%          A.25 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {C So, } it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, {F uh, } long range goals like college and sickness and --   

%          A.27 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- travel and that kind of thing. /  

ba          A.29 utt1:  That sounds good.  /
qw          A.29 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I was just curious, what, {F uh, } part of the country. -/  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } Stockton. /  

bk          A.31 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

qo          B.32 utt1:  How about you? /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {F Uh, } Cincinnati, actually.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, {F uh, } the western accents or something like that.  /
sd^t          A.33 utt3: I don't know how many people are, {F uh, } getting involved in this  /
sv          A.33 utt4: {C but } --   

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- {F uh, } {D well } that's interesting.  /
qy^d          A.35 utt2: [ I'm, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D actually, } {F uh, } I ] was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, {F uh, } reading TELECOM DIGEST  /
qrr          A.35 utt3: {C or } was there another? /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {F Uh, } a colleague of mine at, {F uh, } work got some information over, {F uh, } the computer network called INTERNET. /  

bk          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay.  /
b          A.37 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.37 utt3: that is how I got it as well  /
%          A.37 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C And } he just forwarded that on to me  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } it sounded like it would be an interesting project --   

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  -- to participate in  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C so } I --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: [ it will be interesting to see what, +   

+          B.42 utt1:  -- sent back (( )) mail. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  It would be interesting to see how ] the data base, - /
sd^t          A.43 utt2: (( )) {D so, } {D well, } I guess we're talking about the experiment. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  {F Uh, } probably need to try to get back on the topic  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } it's hard to talk about finances [ without + without ] getting to, {F uh, } dollar figures I guess --    

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  -- {D you know, }  /
co          A.47 utt2: we could talk about some of the long range goals  /
%          A.47 utt3: {C and, } -/  

qo          B.48 utt1:  {D Well } what other long range goals do you have besides college? /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D well } I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point -- /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  -- {F uh, } I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: It seems like every year my employer just gives back, {D you know, } a little bit your tuition reimbursement. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {E I mean } they use to reimburse one hundred percent  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C and } [ now it's, + {F uh, } now it's ] reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class  /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } it's a real shame from what we had before, {F uh, } because we're, -/
