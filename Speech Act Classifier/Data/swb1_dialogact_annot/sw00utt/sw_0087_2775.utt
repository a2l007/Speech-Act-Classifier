o          A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
ad          A.1 utt2: Tell me about your home. /  

sd          B.2 utt1: {D Well, } it's an older home.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: It was made back in the early sixties.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: It's a pier beam house. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1: Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream. /  

ba          A.5 utt1: <Laughter> That's pretty tough <laughter>.  /
qw          A.5 utt2: What area do you live in? /  

sd          B.6 utt1: I live in Houston. /  

bk          A.7 utt1: {F Oh, } okay.  /
b          A.7 utt2: I see.  /
qy          A.7 utt3: Is that pretty typical for your area? /  

^h          B.8 utt1: {D Well, } for the neighborhood I'm in, - /
ny          B.8 utt2: yeah, /  

b^m          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.10 utt1: This is one of the more established neighborhoods, /  

b          A.11 utt1: Huh-uh.  /
ba          A.11 utt2: That sounds real interesting.  /
sd          A.11 utt3: I live in a suburb of Dallas  /
sd          A.11 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home.  /
sd          A.11 utt5: {C So, } at least, I have two bathrooms.  /
sv          A.11 utt6: That's not so bad,  /
sd          A.11 utt7: {C but, } {F uh, } it's pretty typical for the area, as well.  /
sd          A.11 utt8: {F Uh, } I've always been interested in older homes, personally.  /
sv          A.11 utt9: {D So, } I think you can end up doing more with them, it seems like.  /
qo          A.11 utt10: What about yard space?  /
qy          A.11 utt11: Do you have [ lot of, + a big lot, ] or anything like that? /  

sd          B.12 utt1: The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre. /  

bk          A.13 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see. /  

sd          B.14 utt1: About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden. /  

b          A.15 utt1: Huh-uh.  /
ba          A.15 utt2: {F Oh, } that's nice.  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C Because } I have just {D like } [ a very small, + {D you know, } those basic tract ] houses, like that.  /
sd          A.15 utt4: We have a very small yard  /
sd          A.15 utt5: {C and, } {F um, } I do have garden,  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C but } it's extremely small,  /
sv          A.15 utt7: {C but, } {F uh, } it seems like, though, for your area [ that, + that ] is sort of different.  /
sv          A.15 utt8: In a big city like that <throat_clearing> most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a {D you know, } basic tract house. /  

sd          B.16 utt1: {D Well, } in the, {F uh, } newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

sd          B.18 utt1: # if # your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow. /  

sv          A.19 utt1: That's exactly right.  /
sd          A.19 utt2: That's the way we are.  /
sd          A.19 utt3: [ We have, + {F uh, } one thing we have ] that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back.  /
sd          A.19 utt4: {C So } [ we have, + we have ] quite a few parties,  /
sd          A.19 utt5: {C and } {F uh, } seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, {D you know, } hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone.  /
sv          A.19 utt6: {C So, } {F uh, } that's true  /
sd          A.19 utt7: that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together.  /
sd          A.19 utt8: {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it's fine for now,  /
sd          A.19 utt9: hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home.  /
sd          A.19 utt10: The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.  /
sd          A.19 utt11: {D You know, } it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,  /
%          A.19 utt12: {C so. } - /
qy          A.19 utt13: Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?  /
sv          A.19 utt14: {C Because } it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger  /
qy          A.19 utt15: is that true? /  

ny          B.20 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          B.20 utt2: {C And } they've got better closet space. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.22 utt1: (( )) new houses that I've seen. /  

aa          A.23 utt1: Yeah.  /
aa^r          A.23 utt2: Yeah.  /
aa          A.23 utt3: That's really it.  /
sv          A.23 utt4: That's a plus.  /
sd          A.23 utt5: At least we do have {D like } three walk-in closets here.  /
sv          A.23 utt6: {C So } [ that's, + that's ] maybe not so typical,  /
%          A.23 utt7: {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

^2          B.24 utt1:  It helps a bunch. /  

aa          A.25 utt1: Yeah.  /
sd          A.25 utt2: It really does, except when you have to fill them up  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C and then } you get those Visa bills in.  /
%          A.25 utt4: {C And } <laughter>, -/  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qo          A.27 utt1: {D So anyway, } {F um, } anything else [ about the area, + about, ] {F um, } - /
qy          A.27 utt2: {D you know, } can you compare yourself to any thing around there. /  

sd          B.28 utt1: Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.  /
sd          B.28 utt2: This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five. /  

b          A.29 utt1: Yeah.  /
%          A.29 utt2: {C So } [ it's, + it's, ] -/  

sd          B.30 utt1:  Everybody has got a (( )), pretty good size yard, /  

b          A.31 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

sd          B.32 utt1: # {E I # mean, } I got probably the biggest,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,   

b^r          A.33 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

+          B.34 utt1: # in # the entire neighborhood. /  

ba         A.35 utt1: That's nice.  /
ba^r          A.35 utt2: That is nice.  /
sv          A.35 utt3: {C But, } {D you know, } too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.35 utt4: you have to,   

sd          B.36 utt1:  # {D Well, } [ I, # +   

+          A.37 utt1:  # the yard # to deal with  /
%          A.37 utt2: {C and, } -/  

+          B.38 utt1:  I ] enjoy that though. /  

bh          A.39 utt1: Do you.  /
sv          A.39 utt2: You must have more time [ than, + than ] I have.  /
sd          A.39 utt3: I'm sitting out here right now.  /
sd          A.39 utt4: We had this terrible rain  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten  /
%          A.39 utt6: {C and } <laughter> it seems like - /
%          A.39 utt7: now [ that's, + that's, ] - /
sd          A.39 utt8: I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. {D You know, } /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  It's rained (( )). /  

b          A.41 utt1: Yeah.  /
qr^t          A.41 utt2: {D Well, } {F um, } I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?  /
qy          A.41 utt3: Do you know? /  

nn          B.42 utt1: No,  /
%          B.42 utt2: we can,  /
sd^t          B.42 utt3: after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording ((on)),   

bk          A.43 utt1:  # Okay.  # /  

+          B.44 utt1:  # this.  # /  

b^r          A.45 utt1: Okay.  /

qy          A.45 utt3: Are you working on it?  /
qy          A.45 utt4: {E I mean, } do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation? /  

ny          B.46 utt1: Yeah.  /
sd^e          B.46 utt2: This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice. /

sd          A.47 utt6: [ the typical, + the typical ] homes there are {D like, } {D you know, } early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds, /  

ba          B.48 utt1:  # Wow.  # /  

sd          A.49 utt1: # {C and } # I renovated a house there  /
sd          A.49 utt2: {C and } that was so much fun.  /
sd          A.49 utt3: {E I mean, } there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, {D you know, } you're just nobody, practically <laughter>.  /
sd          A.49 utt4: {C And } [ that was really, + that was ] a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline  /
sd          A.49 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } (( )) was considered typical for that area.  /
sd          A.49 utt6: {C So, } {F uh, } it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, {D you know, } a very square little box  /
sv          A.49 utt7: {C and, } {D you know, } there's not a whole lot you can do with it.  /
%          A.49 utt8: {C But, } {F uh, } {D anyway, } -/  

sv          B.50 utt1:  Living in the city has some advantages. /

sd          A.53 utt2: {D Well, } I have lived in a small town for, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.53 utt3: [ this, + this ] town was {D like } less than ten thousand people  /
sd          A.53 utt4: {C and } it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.  /
sd          A.53 utt5: {C And, } {D you know, } I didn't move out of there until I was, {D you know, } twenty-seven  /

sv          A.53 utt11: Its like a rat race sometimes. /  

sd          B.54 utt1: That's just something I'll never adapt to.  /
sd          B.54 utt2: [ I don't, + I don't ] want to be a part of the rat race.  /

no          B.64 utt1: {F Uh, } landscaping is more, than the gardening, /

sd          A.71 utt3: {C and } I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,  /
sd          A.71 utt4: {C so, } the only thing that I use is soap.  /
