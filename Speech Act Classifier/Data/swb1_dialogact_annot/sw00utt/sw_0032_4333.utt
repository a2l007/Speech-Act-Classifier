qr          A.1 utt1: Steve, {F uh, } with the election year and whatnot coming up, do you think we ought to cut taxes, raise them,  /
qo          A.1 utt2: [ [ {C or, } + {C or, } ] + {C or } ] what do you think?  /  

^h          @B.2 utt1: {D Well, } [ that's, + <laughter> that's ] a really hard question.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2: I do know that, {F uh, } politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths.  /
%          @B.2 utt3: {F Uh, } <lipsmack> I - /
ad          @B.2 utt4: let's example, {F uh, } - /
sd          @B.2 utt5: our friend, the President, right now, says no new taxes,  /
sv          @B.2 utt6: we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession  /
sd          @B.2 utt7: {C and } at the same time, the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases,  /
sv          @B.2 utt8: {C so, } {F uh, } I know the politicians, {F uh, } [ aren't, + aren't ] straightforward.  /
sd          @B.2 utt9: {D Now, } [ i-, + in ] terms of economics I'm not, - /
h          @B.2 utt10: it's [ hard, + hard ] to call.  /
h          @B.2 utt11: It really is. /  

b          A.3 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
sv          A.3 utt2: {D See, } [ I never thought really, [ it's, + ] + {F uh, } <lipsmack> I never really thought ] [ that, + that [ the, + the ] ] question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: [ I, + I ] always that [ the, + the ] real question [ was + is, ] are we getting a reasonable return [ on, + on ] investment.  /
sd          A.3 utt4: For instance, like Social Security tax or Soc-, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.3 utt5: {E I mean, } [ that's, + that's ] tax  /
sd          A.3 utt6: we're paying money  /
sd          A.3 utt7: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us.  /  

b          B.4 utt1:  <Laughter> Right. /  

%          A.5 utt1: {C So } that's, - /
%          A.5 utt2: yeah, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.5 utt3: [ when I, + when I ] see that money taken out of my paycheck [ [ each, + each ] week, I, + {E or } [ each, + every ] other week, [ I, + I ] ] really think that money's history  /
sv          A.5 utt4: {C and } --   

aa          B.6 utt1:  Yes, {F uh, } /  

+          A.7 utt1: -- {D you know, } [ so + as ] far as return investment, [ that's not, + that's nothing ]  /
sv          A.7 utt2: {C and } we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back.  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {F Uh, } someone was telling me that [ there is a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } there's still an ] office [ in, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } staffed [ with, + with ] people there {C and, } in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio, [ which, + ] - /
sd          A.7 utt4: I may be wrong,  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C but } I believe that the cure for polio is already founded,  /
sv          A.7 utt6: [ {C but, } + {C but } ] supposedly once you have an office in D C, [ or, + ] {D you know, } [ and, + and ] staff it with people, it's really tough to close it down  /
sd          A.7 utt7: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they just haven't yet. /  

b          B.8 utt1: {D Well, } yeah,  /
h          B.8 utt2: I'm not exactly sure, {F uh, } about polio in particular.  /
sd          B.8 utt3: I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1: -- I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. /  

sd          A.11 utt1: {D Well, } that might be the difference.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: I don't know.  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {F Uh, } the other thing that, {F uh, } I remember seeing on T V lately [ is, + {F uh, } had ] to do with, - /
sd          A.11 utt4: it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people <clanking> politically -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.13 utt1: -- [ [ that, + that histor-, ] + for some reason, historical sites ] with, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] full federal money and everything seem to appear [ [ as, + as ] + almost as ] {D like } political favors [ to, + to ] very strong politicians. /  

b          B.14 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] funny because, {F uh, } it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where, {F uh, } {D you know, } Congress is able to attach all kinds of, {F uh, } funny amendments for individual, {F uh, } [ c-, + congressional ] districts --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1: -- [ to the, + to the ] main budget proposals  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } the poor President [ has, + has ] to, {F uh, } either accept or reject the whole thing. /  

bf          A.17 utt1: {D So, } it sounds like [ you, + {F uh, } you ] think [ that, + that ] we'd be able to save some money by, {F uh } --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- passing the line item veto. /  

aap          B.20 utt1: [ I, + I ] think the line item veto [ is [ not, + not, ] + is not ] necessarily a bad thing, assuming that [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] President, {F uh, } uses it to get rid of, {F uh, } this kind of waste.  /
sd          B.20 utt2: On the other hand, {F uh, } [ it, + it ] assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things.   

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.22 utt1: <Laughter> {F Uh, } and just to get rid of the unimportant things.  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {C And } whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute --   

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1: -- as to, {F uh, } [ where the exa-, + where the boundary ] between waste [ and, + and ] necessity is.  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C So } [ I'm not, + I'm not ] sure [ that, + that ] that will help solve our problems,  /
sv          B.24 utt3: {C but } there definitely [ is, + is ] a problem with, - /
sd          B.24 utt4: {F uh, } I forgot,  /
sd          B.24 utt5: there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

bf          A.27 utt1:  Pork barrel politics. /  

b^m          B.28 utt1: Pork barrel politics.  /
sv          B.28 utt2: [ [ The-, + the-, ] + there ] has to be some way to do it.  /
sd          B.28 utt3: I know state governors usually have line item vetos  /
sd          B.28 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } I lived in Massachusetts for a while  /
sd          B.28 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } when Dukakis vetoed certain things, there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. /  

b          A.29 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv         A.29 utt2: {C but } Massachusetts [ wasn't, + {A when Dukakis was there, anyway, } wasn't ] in that great shape financially. /  

%          B.30 utt1:  D-, - /
sv          B.30 utt2: at least at the end. /  

b          A.31 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
h          A.31 utt2: {E I mean, } I don't know,  /
%          A.31 utt3: I, -/  

b          B.32 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.32 utt2: [ [ i-, + i-, ] + they ] were very good at first,  /
sv          B.32 utt3: they were in very good financials at first  /
sv          B.32 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well.  /
sv          B.32 utt5: {C And then, } of course, the bottom fell out. /  

sv          A.33 utt1: <Laughter> [ [ It's, + {F uh, } {E I mean, } it's, ] + it's ] tough.  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {E I mean, } [ there's, + there's ] two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations.  /
sv          A.33 utt3: I guess you can {D like } raise taxes and then create {D like } job programs and whatnot  /
sv          A.33 utt4: {C or } you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs [ and, + and ] whatnot. /  

^2          B.34 utt1: And spare the economy.  /
%          B.34 utt2: Yeah,  /
sv          B.34 utt3: [ it's really, + it's ] a hard balance. [ It, + it ] definitely is.  /
sv          B.34 utt4: Even not for government, even just, {D say, } for a small business.  /
sd          B.34 utt5: {F Uh, } I know some, -/
