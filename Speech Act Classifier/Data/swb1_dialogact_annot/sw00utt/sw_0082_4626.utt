qo          B.2 utt1: How are you?  /

ny          @A.3 utt2: Yeah.  /

sd          @A.3 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } I've been divorced for, {F um, } eighteen years.  /
sd          @A.3 utt6: {C But } I've two kids and all.  /
sd          @A.3 utt7: {C But } [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + I've ] never had a budget  /
sd          @A.3 utt8: {C and } I don't, {F uh, } do any planning  /
h          @A.3 utt9: {C and } I don't know, /  

x          B.4 utt1:  <Noise>.    

sd          A.5 utt1: (( )) [ I don't, + {F uh, } {F uh, } I don't ] have a long-term financial plan.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I don't try to control my expenses. /  

x          B.6 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.7 utt1: {C But } [ I'm, + I'm ] glad you're a stranger. /  

sv          B.8 utt1: <Laughter> That sounds kind of like me. /  

sd          A.9 utt1: {C But, } really, [ [ [ [ I'm, + I happy, ] + I, ] + I, ] + {D well } I'm ] curious how other people live.  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {F Uh, } {C so } maybe we should start with you <laughter>.  /
qw          A.9 utt3: What do you do? /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  About the same thing. /  

bh          A.11 utt1:  Really? /  

ny          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Oh.  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  Maybe  they're going to arrest us both. /  

sd          B.14 utt1: I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } we live from hand to mouth <laughter>.  /
sd          B.14 utt3: We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not, then we <laughter> (( )) due for the next month. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  Wow. /  

sd          B.16 utt1: A couple of times we've tried some things  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } they worked  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C but } I'm not disciplined enough <swallowing> to keep doing it. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1: The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we [ took and, + {F uh, } took ] my check and divided it out into envelopes --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.20 utt1: -- and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } when the envelope was empty <laughter>, then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.22 utt1: {C And } that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent. /  

b^r          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.24 utt1: <Swallowing> It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money.  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C And } we did that pretty successfully for about three months  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C and then } we started <laughter> borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do. /  

%          A.25 utt1: {F Huh. } The, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.25 utt2: I had a part-time job around, {F oh } gosh, fifteen years ago, seventy-six, /  

x          B.26 utt1:  <Noise>.    

sd          A.27 utt1: {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } this was a sort of a career shift at the time  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C and so } I was willing to take a half time job to do that.  /
sd          A.27 utt3: {C And } I actually did, - /
sd          A.27 utt4: my bank account would, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.27 utt5: [ [ I'd, + I, ] + I ] kept  bouncing checks, just at the end of the month  /
sd          A.27 utt6: {C but } [ I, + I ] had miscalculated.  /
sd          A.27 utt7: [ I, + {D well } I ] didn't keep a balance <laughter>.  /
sv          A.27 utt8: It's one of the problems <<speaks this very faintly>>. /  

x          B.28 utt1:  <Laughter>.     

sd          A.29 utt1:  I never had to in the past. /  

x          B.30 utt1:  <Noise>.   

sd          A.31 utt1: I always kept plenty of money in my checking account,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: {C but } when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money, [ I sometimes + I sometimes ] would just, - /
sd          A.31 utt3: things would get to tight.  /
sd          A.31 utt4: {F Uh, } {C and } sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet  /
sd          A.31 utt5: {C and } every time [ I, + {F uh, } I ] spent money, {E I mean } cash mostly, I would, {F uh, } write it down --    

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.33 utt1: -- so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning. /  

b^r          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.35 utt1: {C But } I would forget to write the things down  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {C and } [ [ [ it, + that ] + I, ] + I ] don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not <laughter> [ [ i-, + i-, ] + in ] keeping that kind of data.  /
sd          A.35 utt3: I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever. /  

sd          B.36 utt1: I even find now {D like } with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that -- /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  -- {C and then } I forget to take that <laughter> out of my  checking account. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.40 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.42 utt1: {C So } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account [ and I figure that, + ] so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1: {C And } I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make. /  

b^r          A.45 utt1: Uh-huh.  /
%          A.45 utt2: The, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.45 utt3: [ [ I, + i-, ] + I ] have to say that,  /
sd          A.45 utt4: let's see, at this point on, I don't run out of money.  /
%          A.45 utt5: {F Uh, } {C and } it, {F uh, } - /
%          A.45 utt6: [ {C a-, } + {C and } ] I don't, {E I mean } - /
sd          A.45 utt7: someday, if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have  /
sd          A.45 utt8: {C and } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think my strategy [ if, + if ] I may, [ [ [ i-, + i-, ] + is to, ] + is to ] not spend money.  /
sd          A.45 utt9: {E I mean } I don't have expensive tastes.  /
sd          A.45 utt10: I don't go out.  /
sd          A.45 utt11: {E I mean } I buy a car,  /
sd          A.45 utt12: {D well } the last car I got rid of I'd had, - /
sd          A.45 utt13: it was nineteen years old. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.47 utt1: [ Pe-, + people ] were embarrassed for me.  /
sv          A.47 utt2: # {E I mean } [ it was, + it was ] a good car  /

bf          B.48 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #  {C ((But } it was)) still running. /  

sv          A.49 utt1: {F Oh, } it was great.  /
sd          A.49 utt2: [ My, + my ] mechanics loved it because [ it was an old, + it was a sixty-five ] Buick  /
sd          A.49 utt3: {C and } it just wouldn't stop.  /
%          A.49 utt4: {F Uh, } {C and } it, - /
sd          A.49 utt5: [ I, + I ] just didn't feel the need for a new car.  /
sd          A.49 utt6: It isn't like I couldn't afford one. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.51 utt1: {F Uh, } {C and } now, {E I mean } [ I, + I ] don't, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.51 utt2: I tend to eat expensive food.  /
sd          A.51 utt3: {E I mean } I don't mind buying a good steak  /
sd          A.51 utt4: {C but } for me, I only do that every week or, [ without even, + ]   

x          B.52 utt1:  <Child_talking>.   

+          A.53 utt1:  {E I mean, } maybe once a month. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.55 utt1: {E I mean } you buy [ a, + a ] tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, {D like } twelve dollars a pound.  /
sd          A.55 utt2: You buy [ a, + a, ] less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars.  /
sv          A.55 utt3: To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  <Laughter> Not very often <noise>. /  

sv          A.57 utt1: [ {C But, } + {C but } ] [ I'm just, + I'm just ] saying as a single person, [ that's, + that's ] a drop in the bucket.  /
sv          A.57 utt2: {C And so } if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it doesn't add up.  [ If you're buying, + {E I mean } if you're not going ] to super expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to. /  

aa          B.58 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd          A.59 utt1: [ So, + so ] that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that [ [ I don't have, + I don't, ] + I don't have ] to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that expensive thing. /
