o          A.1 utt1:  Okay Karen.  /
ad          A.1 utt2:  [ You-, + you're ] first. /  

cc          @B.2 utt1: Okay.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. {D You know, } not to get [ in, + {D like } in ] a dead end job. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1: {C And } plus, for me, it's, {F uh, } {E I mean } {D like } medical and {D you know, } {F uh, } benefits and dental. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  They're also important. /  

b          A.7 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          A.7 utt2: I guess one of the differences I see is, {F uh, } working for a university, {F uh, } there is room for advancement, but not so much so, [ our + ] in, {F uh, } quite a highly unionized environment --   

%          B.8 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          A.9 utt1: -- and then also in the administrative association  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C so } there is a progressive path,  /
sv          A.9 utt3: {C but } <inhaling> not being in [ the + {D say } the ] commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people --    

%          B.10 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- {F uh, } {D like } # really, # -/  

qy          B.12 utt1: # Are they # {D like } pretty much train for a specific job  /
qy^d(^q)          B.12 utt2: {C and } that what I hired for and then [ I, + ] just very little variation from that. /  

ny          A.13 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv^e          A.13 utt2: somewhat that,  /
sv          A.13 utt3: {C but then } also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, {F uh, } a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1: {F Uh, } {C so } that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: {F uh, } it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance -- /  

b^r          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.17 utt1: -- {C and } I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, <swallowing> perhaps somewhat even with the business, {F uh. }  /
sv          A.17 utt2: {C But } I agree, {D you know, } the, {F uh, } medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, {F uh, } security aspect for long term employment, {F uh, } /  

sv          B.18 utt1: {D Well, } {D you know } that's interesting though.  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C Because } I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.  /
sd          B.18 utt3: I use to think that, {D you know, } after you work, - /
qy          B.18 utt4: you mean [ security, + job security? ] /  

sd^m          A.19 utt1:  Job security,  /
ny          A.19 utt2: yes. /  

sv          B.20 utt1: {F Uh, } that use to be I think a couple of years ago,  /
h          B.20 utt2: {C but } I don't know if it is so much anymore.  /
sd          B.20 utt3: In fact, [ they, + we ] just had a lay off in what November, I guess. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.22 utt1: {C But, } {F uh, } it wasn't necessarily, - /
sd          B.22 utt2: {E I mean, } {D you know, } some people had been there a long time. /  

b          A.23 utt1: <Inhaling> Yeah,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: we are seeing that here as well.  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {D Like } in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.25 utt1: {F Uh, } {D so } [ I, + I ] think [ there + it's ] probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world --   

b^r          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.27 utt1: -- in, {F uh, } institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.28 utt2: No # doubt # -- /  

%          A.29 utt1:  # {C But, } # -/  

b          B.30 utt1:  -- yeah. /  

b^m          A.31 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C and } institutionally, like here at the university, {F oh } if there is a cut back, {D well gee, } it's not [ where it necessarily + where it's needed, ]  /
sv          A.31 utt3: it's where it's most expedient which,   

b^m          B.32 utt1: Expedient,  /
aa          B.32 utt2: yeah  /
aa          B.32 utt3: that's exactly it.  /
%          B.32 utt4: Yeah,  /
bf          B.32 utt5: [ where the most dollar, + [ where, + where ] ] {D you know } it cuts back the most. /  

+          A.33 utt1: {D Well, } in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means # it's # --   

b          B.34 utt1:  # Oh. # /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- often the lowest support type roles. /  

b^r          B.36 utt1:  Oh.  /
b          B.36 utt2: {D See, } yeah. /  

%          A.37 utt1: {D So } we, -/  

b^r          B.38 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          B.38 utt2: I think that's one of the things too.  /
sv          B.38 utt3: You get too many management people, {D you know. } /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  It's very easy. /  

b          B.40 utt1: Yeah  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {C and } it's very easy for them to say, {F oh } this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done {D you know. } /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.42 utt1: {C And then } they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time. <laughter>  /
sd          B.42 utt2: {D Well, } those people aren't there anymore. /  

aa          A.43 utt1: Right.  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C Because } it's support people that are # providing # --   

b          B.44 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- the speed for it. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

x          A.47 utt1:  <Inhaling>.   

b          B.48 utt1: Yeah,  /
%          B.48 utt2: {C but, } - /
qo          B.48 utt3: {D so } what else do you think is important? /  

%          A.49 utt1: {D Well } the, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.49 utt2: that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.  /
aa          A.49 utt3: Yeah,  /
sd          A.49 utt4: {C because } my perspective is from an institution, <inhaling>  /
sv          A.49 utt5: {F uh, } [ the, + there ] is not much incentive for innovativeness --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- because the limitation for reward is very severe -- /  

b^r          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.53 utt1: -- {C but } if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for <noise> I guess [ in-, + innovation, ]  /
sv          A.53 utt2: although [ he, + ] {D you know, } the more complex your structure the, {F uh, } less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through -- /  

b^r          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.55 utt1: -- {C but, } {F uh, } I think [ there is, + {F uh, } <inhaling> it's ] a long term type of process where in a small organization [ it's, + ] {F uh, } things  can happen much more quickly  /
sv          A.55 utt2: {C and so } you can see the reward of the efforts. /  

sv          B.56 utt1: I think probably in a small, - /
aa          B.56 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt3: I was going to say [ more, + it's more ] personal for one thing.  /
sv          B.56 utt4: You probably have a better team, {F uh, } cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.58 utt1: Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, {D you know. } /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.59 utt2:  You end up being your own person -- /  

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.61 utt1: -- {C and, } {F uh, } if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, {D well } then that's their problem  /
%          A.61 utt2: {C and } --   

b^r          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.63 utt1:  -- {D you # know } you really, # -/  

sv          B.64 utt1: # whereas # {D yeah } in a smaller, - /
sv          B.64 utt2: I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, {D you know. } /  

aa          A.65 utt1: Yeah.  /
aa^r          A.65 utt2: Yeah.  /
sv          A.65 utt3: It becomes the organization instead of person being {D you know } a part of the individual themselves. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
