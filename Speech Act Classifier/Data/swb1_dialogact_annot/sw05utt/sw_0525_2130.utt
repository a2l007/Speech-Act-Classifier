sd          A.1 utt2: [ I, + I ] would like to talk about, just briefly <throat_clearing> What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context.  /
sv          A.1 utt3: I think it's, {F uh, } refreshing to see [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] support that the President got from the American people. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: [ [ [ it, +  we, ] +   I, ] +  I ] read an interesting article in the paper  that discussed,  {F uh, } that, {F uh, }  /
sv          B.2 utt3: seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like, {F uh, } {F uh, } President Carter and his thing with [ the, + the ] hostage crisis,   

aa          A.3 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  [ and + ] he always did it through rhetoric. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  {C And } this time President Bush did it through action  /

b          A.7 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.8 utt1:  he  ] drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support, /  

aa          A.9 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C or, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } he left almost no alternative. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  That's right <throat_clearing>. /  

sv         B.12 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] it was very interesting how he did it  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ I'm, + I'm ] an Air Force Officer,  /
sd          B.12 utt3: {C so } [ it, + {F uh, }   

b          A.13 utt1:  Really. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  it ] was interesting for me, {F uh, } {D you know, }  /

sv          B.14 utt3: {E [ I, + I  ] mean } I think it's great that all the support. - /
sd          B.14 utt4: I have, {F uh, } friends of mine from the Air,  /
sd          B.14 utt5: [ I'm, + I'm ] an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory, /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.16 utt1:  {C but } other [ engi-, + guys ] here on base, - /
sd          B.16 utt2: this is a B fifty-two base where I work,  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C so, }     

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and } they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it. /  

ba          A.19 utt1:  That's great, {F um, }  /
sd          A.19 utt2: [ if, + if ] you remember, the vote in the Congress to authorize war, if necessary, was actually pretty close. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  Yes  /
sd          B.20 utt2: it was. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C And } [ if, + if ] my memory serves me right, I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it,  /

b          B.22 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: [ I'm, +  I don't ] know the exact figure  /
sv          B.22 utt3: {C but } [ I, + I ] would imagine that because  of [ the, + ] how close [ the, + the ]  vote  was {E [ I'm,    + {F uh, } I ] mean }  almost certainly would have to be.  /
sv          B.22 utt4: Just based on [ the sheer numbers of, + {F uh, } the disparity of, ] <cough> {E excuse me, } Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been, {F um. } /  

aa          A.23 utt1:  That's right. /  

%          B.24 utt1: {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] - /
sv          B.24 utt2: gosh [ this, + {F uh, } this ] whole thing now with [ all the, + {F uh, } all the ] political cartoons on the Democrats and how [ they're, + {F uh, } {F uh, }   

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  they're ] [ in, + in ] a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election, anyway. /  

sv(^q)          A.27 utt1:  Especially the ones that came out and said, oh come on guys, let's talk about this little while longer. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.28 utt2: yeah. /  

qh          A.29 utt1:  {E I mean } how many years are we going to wait  /
qh          A.29 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ what, + what ] do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.30 utt2: right,  /
sv          B.30 utt3: I think that was, - /

aa          A.31 utt1:  No doubt. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  everyone was discussing whether we should, {F uh, } wait longer,  /
sv          B.32 utt2: {C but, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer  /
sv          B.32 utt3: {C but } I think we were genuinely concerned about [ how, + ] their military capability  /
sv          B.32 utt4: {C and } [ we, + {F uh, } I think we ] over estimated it,  /
sv          B.32 utt5: {C but } still,     

aa          A.33 utt1:  I think so too. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  we were really, highly concerned about it  /
sv          B.34 utt2: {C and, } [ that +  we were worried that ] they were getting dug in  /

sv          A.35 utt1:  {D Well } [ they were, +     

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  {C and } in fact they were ] so well dug in that, {F uh, } when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Right,  /
%          B.38 utt2: [ they couldn't, {D yeah } + they couldn't, ]  /
aa          B.38 utt3: yeah,  /
aa          B.38 utt4: it's true  /
%          B.38 utt5: they, - /
sv          B.38 utt6: Saddam thought he had the whole thing, {F uh, } figured out [ to, + to ] which way we were coming and [ which, + [ what, + what ] ] our doctrine was  [ that, + ] {F uh, } /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  {D Well, } [ had, + had ] we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  That's right,  /
aa          B.40 utt2: that's true.  /
aa          B.40 utt3: That's interesting,  /
sv          B.40 utt4:  I think, {F uh, } this political situation over there now is, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sv          B.40 utt5: it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether [ the, + this ] opposition will, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /

sv          A.43 utt1:  {D Well, } Baker is really not very much pro Israel. /

sd^e          B.46 utt2: [ I, + I ] think I did hear that at one time a long time ago, /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {C because } I used to live in, {F uh, } Massachusetts,  /

b          A.49 utt1:  Right,  /

b^m          B.50 utt2: New Hampshire. /  

bk          A.51 utt1:  Okay.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back. /  

ba          B.52 utt1:  {F Oh } my gosh. /  

sv          A.53 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } now he is a conservative,  /
sv          A.53 utt2: {C but } he is not a conservative that favors Israel, /  

b          B.54 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  {C and } [ that, + that  ] concerns me greatly. /

%          B.56 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt3: I'd certainly, {F uh, } support Israel [ in, + in ] [ their, + their ] policy [ that + ] in defending themselves and [ in, +  {F uh, } in ] their handling of their foreign policy,  /
sv          B.56 utt4: [ I think, + I think ] the stand they have, [ or, + or ] the way the  command respect, [ I, + I ] support that.  /
sv          B.56 utt5:  I think that is [ a, + a ] positive thing for them after, {F um, } {F uh, } thousands of years,  /
sv          B.56 utt6: [ they have to, + {F uh, } they ha-, ] - /
%          B.56 utt7: I think they in, - /
sd          B.56 utt8: when they [ be-, + became ] a country they [ more than,  or, + more  or ] less decided they weren't going to take it anymore,  /
%          B.56 utt9: {C and, } {F uh. } -/  

sv          A.57 utt1:  {D Well, } they didn't have much choice,  /
sv          A.57 utt2: they could either fight or die. /  

aa          B.58 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.58 utt2: exactly, exactly  /
fe          B.58 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } {F um, } {C so, } gee,  /
sd          B.58 utt4: I lost my train of thought here.  /
%          B.58 utt5: [ {C But, } +  {F uh, } {F um, } {C so, } ] okay  /
sd          B.58 utt6: {C so } I can't say whether [ that, + that ]    I'm  pro Israel  or anti Israel.  /
sv          B.58 utt7: {E I mean, }   I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region  /
sv          B.58 utt8: {C and } looks {F uh, } that the joining of forces for this, {F uh, } {F uh, } Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing. /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  It is a positive thing, {F um, }  /
sv(^q)          A.59 utt2: however, {F uh, } every time an organization such as the P L O says {D well } we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, {F uh, } they get embarrassed [ some, + ] every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them. /  

aa          B.60 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  {C And so } [ you, + you ] basically have, {F uh, } mutually exclusive interests,  /

%          B.62 utt2: somebody's going to, - /
sv          B.62 utt3: {C and } I think that's the problem the P L O has is that [ when they, +  whenever one group of them ] decides that they're going to negotiate, or they're going to do something, they're going to try to make some peace, [ but, + ] {F uh, } the end result is that [ they, +  there ] so many factions of them  [ and, + ] {F uh, } some more violent than others, some with a certain agenda different than the others,  or they split,  /
sv          B.62 utt4: they end up [ being, + becoming ] divisive themselves. /  

aa          A.63 utt1:  Exactly. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  {F Uh, } I, - /

aa          B.68 utt2: I know,  /

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  [ an, + an ] incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and  the State Department. /
