h          A.9 utt2:  Of course, I don't,  {D you know, } - /
sd          A.9 utt3: I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing - /
sd          A.9 utt4: I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic,  I said, {D well, } I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm <laughter>.  /
sd(^q)          A.9 utt5: He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about <laughter>. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {D Well, } I hope it is, /  

x          A.11 utt1:  <Laughter>. 

sd          B.12 utt1:  there's not a whole lot of different kinds. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  That's about the only kind I know how to do. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: [ I, +  {C because } I ] get seasick,  /

sd          B.18 utt2: We have a  [ lot of, + {F uh, } {F uh, } couple of ] lakes in our area that are  [ fil-, +  just filled ] with good sized bass. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {C And then } when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish -- /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  -- {C and } we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like  minnows --   

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  -- a little bit bigger than minnows,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C and then } I also use spinner baits and plastic worms. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of  day. /  

bf          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } it sounds like you do quite a bit of it. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  I do.  /
sd          B.28 utt2: {F Uh, } there's a lake {D like } maybe two or three miles from here,  /

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think.  /
sd          B.30 utt2: Fishing's a good way to do that,  /
sd          B.30 utt3: {C and } I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing. /  

qy          A.31 utt1:  Do you have a boat? /  

nn          B.32 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.32 utt2: I don't.  /

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I wish I had a boat,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C but } I don't. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas.  /
sd          A.37 utt2: The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- {C but } unless you have a boat you can't really get into [ the, +  where they call the ] good fishing holes, {D you know. } /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Right.  /
qy^g          B.40 utt2:  That's the same way here, isn't it? /  

qy          A.41 utt1:  Is it? /  

na          B.42 utt1:  You have to get back in the sticks in the, -/  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.43 utt2:  My in-laws live on a lake, {F uh, } a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,  /
sd          A.43 utt3: {C and } the lake is beautiful,  /
sd          A.43 utt4: {C and } I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,  /
sd          A.43 utt5: {C but } actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.  /
sd          A.43 utt6:  I catch a lot of little old, {F uh, } I think they call them perch -- /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  -- {C and then } [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } turtles try to eat up all my bait <laughter>. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  <Laughter> Oh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {C So } [ it's, + it's ] so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit -- /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  [ We don't have, +   

sd          A.49 utt1:  -- {C but } it's kind of fun. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  We don't have  ] a big problem with turtles,  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C but } we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {F Um } --   

sd          B.52 utt1:  {C And } [ I, +     

+          A.53 utt1:  -- I would be afraid of that. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  {D Well, } I ] can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them. /  

qy          A.55 utt1:  Do they ever get on your hook? /  

nn          B.56 utt1:  No,  /
%          B.56 utt2: we, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.56 utt3: occasionally I'll catch an eel --   

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  -- [ on a, + on a ] hook, but never the snakes.  /
%          B.58 utt2:  They just kind of, -/  

qy          A.59 utt1:  Are they poisonous snakes? /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {F Uh, } we have a lot of cotton mouth,  /
ny          B.60 utt2: {C so } yes  /
sd^e          B.60 utt3: they are, definitely -- /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  -- {C and } they live in [ little shallow, +  little ] coves that I like  to fish in,  /
sd          B.62 utt2: {C so } I seem them swimming by every once in a while. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.64 utt2: [ [ they can, +   they're, ] +  they're ] certainly ugly. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.65 utt2:  We, {F uh, } saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws'   place last year.  /
sd          A.65 utt3: It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that {D you know. }  /
sd          A.65 utt4: Great big snake,  /
sd          A.65 utt5: {C and } [ it, + of course, it  ] scared the women to death, {D you know, }  /
sd(^q)          A.65 utt6: {C but } the men come out and said {F oh, } {D well, } that's only [ a, + a  ] king snake, it won't really hurt you, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.65 utt7: {C But } it looked so bad -- /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  -- {C and } it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,  /
sd          A.67 utt2:  {C but } we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there,  {D you know } <laughter>. /  

aa          B.68 utt1:  Definitely. /  

sv          A.69 utt1:  {C But } they're scary looking. /  

qy          B.70 utt1:  Do you have bass? /  

ny          A.71 utt1:  Yes, {F uh, }  /
sd^e          A.71 utt2: I think that, {F uh, } probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.72 utt2:  {D Well, } that's pretty much the same way here. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.74 utt1:  I, -/  

sd          A.75 utt1:  {D Now, } they have a lot of bass tournaments. /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  {D Well, } we have those.  /
%          B.76 utt2: I don't -- -/  

b          A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  -- [ I +  inevitably, if I ] enter one of those, I never catch a  thing. /  

ba          A.79 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

sd          B.80 utt1:  I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it. /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          A.81 utt2:  {D Well } that's kind of, - /
sd          A.81 utt3: we've never entered a tournament or anything.  /
sd          A.81 utt4: We're not that big into fishing,  /
sd          A.81 utt5: {C but } I see a lot of people,  /
sd          A.81 utt6: {D you know, } early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,  /
sd          A.81 utt7: {C and } they'll say, {D Well, } there's a big bass tournament this weekend,  /
sd          A.81 utt8: {C and } all those people are here for the tournament, {D you know. } /  

ba          B.82 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes. /  

sv          A.83 utt1:  {C So } I think there's a lot of people that have, {D you know, } [ really, + I guess that you'd call it really  ] sport fishing,  /
sv          A.83 utt2: they're really into it to try to win. /  

aa          B.84 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.84 utt2: {F oh, } definitely.  /

%          A.85 utt1:  My. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  Certainly here they are. /  

sv          A.87 utt1:  {C But } [ it is, + it's  ] [ very, + a very  ] relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.  /
sv          A.87 utt2:  The peace and  calmness is really relaxing. /  

aa          B.88 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.88 utt2: it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and  read and fish. /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.90 utt1:  That's what I do a lot. /  

sd          A.91 utt1:  I've never tried taking a book with me.  /
