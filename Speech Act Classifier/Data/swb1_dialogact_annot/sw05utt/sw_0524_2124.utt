sd          B.2 utt1:  [ I like, + {D well } I like ]  to cook foods I like to eat.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: I like to eat Italian food best. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {C And } I find that [ I, + ] that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals, type things and,    

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  they're kind of convenient. /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  That would be good for a dinner party, [ that, +  {D you know, } to cook that ] because you don't have to deal with eight different things,    

aa          B.8 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.9 utt1:  coming out at once.  /
qy          A.9 utt2: Is that what you usually cook when you have a party. /  

nd          B.10 utt1:  {F Um, } I usually have parties that are smaller groups.  /
sd^e          B.10 utt2:  [ I don't have, + I've never had ] a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like  Thanksgiving and such. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.12 utt1:  {C And so, } {F um, } yeah,  /

sd^e          B.12 utt3: I like to cook, {F um, } heavy sauces,  and, {F um, }   

b          A.13 utt1:  Really,  /
ba          A.13 utt2: that sounds good. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  noodles and pasta and such. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  {F Um, } fattening <laughter>. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.16 utt2: actually <laughter>.  /
qo          B.16 utt3: How about you,  /
qw          B.16 utt4: what do you like [ to, + to ] cook? /  

%          A.17 utt1:  {F Uh, } we, - /
sv          A.17 utt2: it's funny that, {F um, } we're talking about this,  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  we  just had a dinner party  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C and } we had, {F um, } - /
sd          A.17 utt5: our senior pastor and his wife came over. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  {C And } I catered to their diet is the only thing, though,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C so } it wasn't something I really wanted to make.  /
sd          A.19 utt3: I really wanted to make red beans and rice [ and + ] with  ((   )) .   

b          B.20 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  {D you know, } sausage,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C because }  I'm from New Orleans originally. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } I was going to make that,  red beans and rice with [ the, + those ] Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } {D well } there's salad  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C and } then for desert [ I would, + ] I really wanted to make, {F um, } just brownies  /
sd          A.23 utt4: {C or } French donuts would have been good,  /
sv          A.23 utt5: {C but } it's real hard to make them.  /
sv          A.23 utt6:  They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here,  /
sd          A.23 utt7: I don't know why. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  {F Oh } really. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have  /
%          A.25 utt2: {C but, } -/  

sv          B.26 utt1:  Humidity or something. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:  {F um, } that's what I want.  /
sd          A.27 utt2:  That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that  /
%          A.27 utt3: {C but. } -/  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  Kind of like the Italian,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: it's really good,  /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C but } instead I catered to their diet  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C so } I made baked chicken in the crock pot  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C and, } {F um, } it was good and  everything,  /
sd          A.29 utt6: it had all the vegetables in it,  /
sv          A.29 utt7: {C but, } it seemed kind of boring compared <laughter>, -/  

sv          B.30 utt1:  It [ kind of, + {F uh, } kind of ] down played compared to what you would like, huh. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

qy          B.32 utt1:  Do you find yourself, {F um, } with all the, {F um, } cholesterol [ and, + and ] high fiber changing the way [ that you  fi-, + that you entertain?  ] /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain,  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {C because } [ I guess, + I guess  ] I feel like if they're on a diet like that, I'm going to,  {D you know, } honor that,  /
%          A.33 utt3: {C but } if it's just - /
sd          A.33 utt4: another couple came, {F um, } over a couple weeks later  /
sd          A.33 utt5: {C and } I made, - /
^h          A.33 utt6: what did I make that night.  /
sd          A.33 utt7: I made a roast, /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C and } I made, {F um, } {F uh, } - /
sd          A.35 utt2: I can't believe this  /
sd          A.35 utt3: my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday. /  

ba          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh } no. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  I can't believe that.  /
sd          A.37 utt2: Anyway, {C but } I asked, - /
sd          A.37 utt3: when  (( Ricky ))  and (( Carrie )) came over we made, {F um, } a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C And } normally [ I, don't eat, + we don't eat ] like that during the week because of [ the, + {D you know, } the ] calories and the fat in it. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv(^q)          A.41 utt1:  {C But } {D you know, } when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it.  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C And } I made blueberry cobbler <laughter>  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {C and } we had extra crust with it, /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  it was so fattening. /  

ba          B.44 utt1:  That sounds good. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  {C But, } I don't think we gained any weight from it  /
%          A.45 utt2: {C so. } -/  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {D Well, } every once in a while [ I, + I ] think I feel the same way.  /
sd          B.46 utt2: When I'm entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's  really, really, - /
sv          B.46 utt3: {D like } a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories,  /
sv          B.46 utt4: {C so } I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play, sometimes. /  

aa          A.47 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: I made an apple pan  (( downy ))  when the pastor and his wife came over  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C and } she didn't eat it. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  {C But } I did bake apples so that it would be, not brownies, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.49 utt2: I figured there was less calories in apple pan  (( downy ))  than in fudge brownies. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          B.50 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {C So, } {F um, } I've  (( read ))  a good brownie recipe. /  

ba          B.52 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's good. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  [ {C But, } +  {F uh, } anyway, {C so } ] I guess that's about what I did when I entertained. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qy          A.55 utt1:  {C So, } do you have anything else you want to say about it? /  

^h          B.56 utt1:  {F Um, } nothing comes to mind right off,  /
nn          B.56 utt2: {C so } I guess not. /  

bk          A.57 utt1:  Okay,  /
fc          A.57 utt2: {D well } it was nice talking to you. /
