sd          B.60 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I  ] used a three wood rather than a driver. /  

ba          A.61 utt1:  That helps. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {F Uh, } I had a lot more control on it, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.62 utt2: I sacrificed distance,  /

sv          B.68 utt2: {D well, } [ I, + I ] read  recently here, [ they say, + ] [ if you're playing, + if you're ] scoring well, you should play more.  /

sv          B.72 utt3: Apparently they're very difficult to play with,  /
sd          B.72 utt4: {C but } with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.  /

sd          B.72 utt6: it's incredible. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /
