b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qw          A.5 utt2:  Where do you play golf in this area? /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } <inhaling> we live, {F uh, } pretty close,    

x          A.7 utt1:  <Sneezing>.   

+          B.8 utt1:  to the Mesquite Golf Course. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {D So, } we will play either out there or at Firewheel.  /
sd          B.10 utt2: That is usually where we play,  /
sd          B.10 utt3: {C but } I have played {D you know } different courses in in the Dallas area. /  

qr          A.11 utt1:  [ Do you, + {F uh, } do you ] ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf? /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {F Uh, } both <laughter>. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  Not at the same time. /  

sd(^q)          A.15 utt1:  I was going to say, that could be difficult <laughter>. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  <Laughter> {D No, }  sometimes we ride  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } sometimes, {F uh, } we, pull,  /
sd          B.16 utt3: we like to, to, {F uh, } a lot of the times just walk, {F uh, } for the exercise.  /
%          B.16 utt4: # {C But } # -- -/  

b          A.17 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  -- I find that when I ride in a cart, I play better  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C and } I think it is cause I don't get as tired <laughter>. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  I think that might be true. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path. /  

aa          B.22 utt1:  I know,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {C and } that makes me so mad <<louder>>. /  

x          A.23 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.24 utt1:  {D You know, } [ it is + {D like } it is ] not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently <laughter>. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  That is the reason, I don't play over there. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  I like the course,  but I don't play over there because, [ you, + they ] don't, {F uh, } {D you know } don't allow you to pull a cart. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {C And, } I don't think a cart damages the turf. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.30 utt2:  {D Well, } the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, {F uh, } ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars,  /
%          B.30 utt3: yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt4: a hundred dollars  /
sd          B.30 utt5: {C cause } it is half price what the normal green fees are. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C So } that is <noise> why we <noise> {D you know } play over there  /
sd          B.32 utt2: {C cause } we have got our card <laughter>. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess I could use a card too.  /
sd          A.33 utt2: I live, {F uh, } [ very near, + {F uh, } very close ] to the Firewheel Golf Course. /

sd          A.47 utt1:  -- {C but } my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again  /

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.48 utt2:  {D Well, } you need to, {F uh, } teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you <laughter>. /

b          B.76 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C And } they have been, - /
sv          A.77 utt2: we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  {F Oh, } they do great.  /
sd          B.78 utt2:  I put mine in probably in November. /

sd          B.80 utt10: {C so } [ they are, + {F uh, } they are ] good to plant in the winter time.  /
sd          B.80 utt11: They last for a long time then.  /
sd          B.80 utt12: {C So, } if you start putting them, {D you know, } you can put them out in the spring too,  /
sd          B.80 utt13: {C but } once it starts getting real hot --   

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  -- then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather. /
