qy          A.1 utt1:  Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list  /
"          A.1 utt2: {C and } their either offering a service  /
"          A.1 utt3: {C or }  they're introducing some new product in the area  /
"         A.1 utt4: {C and } normally when they call, you're either in the shower,  /
"         A.1 utt5: {C or } you're in the middle of cooking something  /
"         A.1 utt6: {C and } you have to stop everything to run to the phone. /  

ny          B.2 utt1:  Yes,  /
ny^r          B.2 utt2: yes.  /
qy          B.2 utt3: [ Is, + is ] that one that you're talking about. -/  

na          A.3 utt1:  That was the big one I'm talking about.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  I work weird hours,  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C and } invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.4 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {C And } you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: [ you either hear, the cli-, + as soon as you say hello, you hear the click ] of the recording coming on, /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C or } you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that  they've read probably a thousand times that day already. /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  That's true,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: or the ones that [ are, + are ] generated by a computer.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:  It's just a computer voice that comes on the line.  /
sd          B.8 utt4: Those are the ones that I really, really hate too. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  I've even had some of them,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: [ the, + they're ] voice activated  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C and } you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.10 utt2: uh-huh.  /
b          B.10 utt3:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.10 utt4: sometimes [ I, + I ] get them on my, {F uh, } answering machine at home  /
sd          B.10 utt5: [ {C so, } + {C and } ] I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages  /
sd          B.10 utt6: {C and } I go through them  /
sd          B.10 utt7: {C and } most of them aren't from anybody at all. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  What I would love to see done to stop all of this, -/  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  we've got a thing in this country,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: you can have your phone number unlisted, /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  {C and } I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, - /
sv          A.15 utt2: I think it's great, that {D you know, } freedom of speech in this country and  everything, - /
sv          A.15 utt3: {C but } if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like  everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          B.16 utt2: yes,  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {D see } I have an unlisted telephone number,  /
sd          B.16 utt4: {C but } I still get all of those calls  /
sd          B.16 utt5: {C and then } some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand.  /
ny          B.16 utt6: {C So, } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.16 utt7: I do,  /
sd          B.16 utt8: I really feel that's, {F uh, } an invasion of my privacy.  /
aa          B.16 utt9: I agree with you on that particular subject there.  /
^h          B.16 utt10:  Let me see. /  

%          A.17 utt1:  That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or  people peddling products.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  If I wanted their products, I would have either gone to the store to bought it,  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C or } I would have called for their salesman to come out. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          B.18 utt2: uh-huh.  /
aa          B.18 utt3:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.18 utt4: that's true.  /
sd          B.18 utt5:  Living in an apartment complex though, {D you know } [ you can't, + {F um, } you can't ] really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.18 utt6: {C but } they still come up to the front door and, {F uh, } {D you know, } walk around.  /
sd          B.18 utt7: {C So, } usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey,  there's people coming around, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.18 utt8: {C and } they're trying to sell something  /
sd          B.18 utt9: [ {C or, } + {C or } ] they're from a religious organization  /
sd          B.18 utt10: {C and } I really hate that.  /
sd          B.18 utt11:  I really, really do.  /
sd          B.18 utt12:  I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago  /
sd          B.18 utt13: {C and, } {F uh, } gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too.  /
sd          B.18 utt14:  It wasn't even what I would consider, {D you know, } family hours,  /
sd          B.18 utt15: time to, {D you know, } start going to bed  /
sd          B.18 utt16: [ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and } ] it was somebody from, {F um, } oh what was it, the, {F uh, } Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,  /
sd          B.18 utt17: {C and } {F uh, } I've read a lot about, {F uh, } that particular sect  /
sd          B.18 utt18: {C and } I don't particularly care for it,  /
sd          B.18 utt19: {C so } I especially don't like for them to come up to my door [ and, + and ] try and talk to me. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  {D Now, } I agree with their right to, {F uh, } <TV> pursue their religion of choice, in [ that, + whatever ] manner they want to,  /
sv          A.19 utt2: {C but } I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an apartment.  /
sd          A.19 utt3:  I'm on my turf,  /
sd          A.19 utt4: if I want them there, I'll call for them,  /
sd          A.19 utt5: otherwise, I don't want to know they exist. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.20 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          B.20 utt3: no,  /
aa          B.20 utt4: [ I, + I ] agree with you there.  /
sv          B.20 utt5:  If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, {D you know, } as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in.  /
sd          B.20 utt6:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I don't like the way that they do it either,  /
sd          B.20 utt7: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] it's their mission that they do it.  /
sd          B.20 utt8:  They go door to door  /
sd          B.20 utt9: {C and } they go out into the public  /
sd          B.20 utt10: {C and } they actually have the, {F uh, } teenagers serving two years [ like + you would say like ] in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work  /
h          B.20 utt11: {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sd          B.20 utt12:  I just, {F um, } don't particularly care for that at all.  /
sv          B.20 utt13: {C And } [ that, + that's ] one thing that I feel really strongly about though, is, {F uh, } {D you know, } people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting [ to + {F uh, } {D you know, } to ] try and  get me to join or, {D you know, } become interested in their religion,  /
sd          B.20 utt14: {C because } I have my own. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {D Now } the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting,  /
%          A.21 utt2: I've even gone so far as to put that, - /
sd          A.21 utt3: I've got a storm door on the front of the house  /
%          A.21 utt4: {C and } I've put, in, - /
sd          A.21 utt5: I don't know how much clearer it can be,  /
sd          A.21 utt6: it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.  /
sv          A.21 utt7:  [ I should have, + I guess I should make ] another one that says religious or  otherwise, cause I still get, -/  

aa          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
aa          B.22 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          B.22 utt3: that's true,  /
aa          B.22 utt4: yeah.  /
aa          B.22 utt5:  No  /
sd          B.22 utt6: [ [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't have, ] + I didn't go ] that far  /
%          B.22 utt7: {C but, } {F uh, } yeah  /
sv          B.22 utt8: I probably could do the same thing, {F uh, } {D you know, }  /
sd          B.22 utt9: I don't have a storm door,  /
sd          B.22 utt10: {C but } I'm sure I could rig up something.  /
sv          B.22 utt11:  {C But } {D you know } I don't think that that would stop people.  /
sv          B.22 utt12:  [ I, + it's ] like they see that word  /
sv          B.22 utt13: {C and } it says go <laughter>, instead of stop.  /
fe          B.22 utt14:  {F Oh, } goodness. /  

sd@          A.23 utt1:  I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this  get their names, their addresses, and their phone numbers  / *[[slash error with utt2]]
o          A.23 utt2: {C and then } reverse it,  /
%          A.23 utt3: {C and } do, - /
sd          A.23 utt4: {D well } that would be technically illegal,  /
sd          A.23 utt5: it would be harassment. /  

ba          B.24 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Oh } gosh. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  {C But, } I consider an invasion of my privacy,   

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.26 utt2: yeah. /  

+         A.27 utt1:  a harassment in itself. /

sv          A.29 utt1:  I believe we've pretty much summed everything up. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  I know,  /
