ad          A.1 utt1:  tell me what you think about the Vietnam war. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: {D Well, } I'm a Vietnam era veteran,  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } I was, {F uh, } fortunate not to have to serve in the theater,  /
sd          @B.2 utt4: however, my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation.  {F Uh, }  /
sd          @B.2 utt5: I'm of the old school that believes that, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } {F uh, } contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored.  /
sv          @B.2 utt6:  However, {F uh, } I think we could have executed the war {C and } gotten it over a whole lot quicker.  {F Uh, }  /
sd          @B.2 utt7: {C but } those are my personal thoughts,  /
sv          @B.2 utt8: {C and } I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people.  /
sv          @B.2 utt9: {C But } as it was, the politicians ran [ the, + the ] Korean conflict and  ultimately the Vietnam thing,  /
sv          @B.2 utt10: {C and } we managed to come out, {F uh, } losers all the way around.  /
sv          @B.2 utt11: {C And } {C so } this is what [ trigger-, + ultimately triggered  ] us, {F uh, } United States, {F uh, } per se, [ being, +  {F uh, } deciding ] to get out of the role of world policeman.  /
ad          @B.2 utt12: Your views, -/  

sv          A.3 utt1:  {F Uh, } as I understand it, {A {C and } I, {F uh, } <barking> don't know a lot about it, } {F uh, } we got in there because of <barking> France -- /

sd          B.6 utt1:  We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, <noise> {F uh, } we pledged a mutual, {F uh, } {F uh, } defense [ of, + of ] the South Vietnamese,  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another,  /
%          B.6 utt3: {C and } really we <laughter> <noise> - /
sd          B.6 utt4: [ I, + I ] question us, {D you know, } now,  /
sd         B.6 utt5: of course hindsight is all too clear. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so, } [ we're, + [ we, + we ] ] [ have to, + have to ] deal [ with, + with  ] the, {F uh, } situation [ as, + as ] we played it. /  

qw          A.9 utt1:  Jerry, what did you think of people like, {F uh, } Jane Fonda, another [ war an-, + anti-war ] activist. /  

%          B.10 utt1:  I, <laughter> - /
sv          B.10 utt2: don't get me started on those people.  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {D You know, } [ before she, + before Jane Fonda  ] [ did, + did ] what she did, I thought she was a wonderful person,  /
%          B.10 utt4: {C but } after, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D well, } - /
sd          B.10 utt5: [ I, + I  ] just don't [ have anything, + want anything ] to do with her any more,  /
sv          B.10 utt6: {C because } [ you support, +  {F uh, } you support ] your government. /

sd          A.15 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] didn't  realize that we'd signed some type of deal like  that.  /
sd          A.15 utt2: I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they decided to pull out  /
%          A.15 utt3: {C and, } -/

sd          B.22 utt7: I don't.  /
sd(^q)          B.22 utt8: {C But } from what I can gather, is we went and said yeah,  we will help the South Vietnamese, {F uh, } should they ask.  /
