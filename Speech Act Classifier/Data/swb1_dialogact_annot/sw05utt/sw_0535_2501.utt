aa          B.6 utt1:  No. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  as long as it's [ not in, + not to  ] the point of where it [ 's, +  {F uh, } needs ]  to be scraped and [ bl-, + ] peeling, /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C and } our house is not - /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C but } it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C and } it's just a hassle to go through it  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C so } I'm looking for the easy way out. /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.10 utt2: {F uh, } I know.  /

no          A.11 utt1:  It's easier to find painters,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C but } [ you have to be, + you have to be ] aware of [ what, + {F uh, } how ] messy they can get and are they going to put on [ a good, + a good ] two coats, and are they,   

%          B.12 utt1:  Ri-, - /

b          B.16 utt2: yeah. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.17 utt2:  {F Uh, } interior's not so bad because it's more fun,  /
%          A.17 utt3: it's more, c-, - /
%          A.17 utt4: {C but } yeah, /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  outside you have high peeks,    

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  and those kind of things,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: it can be a real issue. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } when we've painted, {F um, } - /
sd          B.22 utt2: right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles,    

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  on the back  and there's some sort of stone  or something in the front  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C so }  there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.   /
%          B.24 utt3: {F Um, }  {C but, }  [ i-, + it, ] - /
sd          B.24 utt4: the problem is that [ it   hits, + the sun hits ] it.  /
sd          B.24 utt5: {C So } preparing is a real problem, /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  you've got to prepare it well  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C or } else it will flake. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.28 utt1:  {F Um, } /  

%          A.29 utt1:  Here they, - /
sd          A.29 utt2: some of the home builders are, - /
sd          A.29 utt3: they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C so } they put up, {F uh, } a quarter inch Masonite, basically,  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C and } they painted it kind of like a  (( spun ))   (( of a sorts ))  /
sd          A.29 utt6: {C so } it's real cheap.  /
sd          A.29 utt7: {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid   and [ I, + ]   as low as five hundred and forty dollars  /
%          A.29 utt8: {C so } it's,   

ba          B.30 utt1:  Wow.    

+          A.31 utt1:  just a matter of, - /
%          A.31 utt2: it's, -/  

+          B.32 utt1:  that's quite a range. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {F Oh, } there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap  /
sd          A.33 utt2: {C and } I'm so much worried about that as what,   

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  I don't want it all over the brick and windows  /
%          A.35 utt2: {C and, } -/  

aa          B.36 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
sv          B.36 utt2: which might be a bigger problem than it would be, {F uh, } -/  

ba          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } sure. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.38 utt2: absolutely <breathing>. /  

qy^d          A.39 utt1:  {C So }  y'all, you  haven't had [ any, + any ] jobs painted in your house [ or + ] recently ((   )) . /  

nn          B.40 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.40 utt2: we [ 've +  have, ]  {F uh, } done a little painting ourselves, {F um, }  /
sd          B.40 utt3: we painted the bedroom, {F uh, } well within the last [ t-, + ] couple of months, /  

ba          A.41 utt1:  That's fun. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {C and } [ we have, + we have ] some more that need to be done, /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {C but } [ the, + the ] problem that [ we've, + we've ] owned this house almost five years now,  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  {C and, } {F um, } when we bought it [ the, + ] {F um, } it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired,  ((   ))  /
sd          B.44 utt3: {C but } the daughter was a real estate agent  /
sd          B.44 utt4: {C and } she was selling it  /
sd          B.44 utt5: {C and } it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house.  /
sd          B.44 utt6:  {C So } she told us that the house had been, {F uh, } professionally painted recently.  /
sd          B.44 utt7:  {C And } it looked pretty good, {D you know, }   [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] interior walls all basically white,  /
sd          B.44 utt8: {C but } they obviously had been done without to   much, {F uh, } wear afterward.  /
sd          B.44 utt9:  The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on [ the wood-, + {F uh, } the  ] door frames, /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it. /  

ba          A.47 utt1:  {F Uh, } that's not very, -/  

sd          B.48 utt1:  Big long strips.  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {C So } what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.  /
sd          B.48 utt3:  {C And } some of   still has to be redone. /  

bf          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } they just painted over varnished wood. /  

aa          B.50 utt1:  Yeah, /  

ba          A.51 utt1:  {F Oh, } my, /  

ar          B.52 utt1:  {D well, } no  /
sd          B.52 utt2: actually [ [ it had been, + {F uh, } it would have been, ] + it had been  ] a repaint job. /  

b          A.53 utt1: {F Um. } /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But } they had not, - /
sd          B.54 utt2: either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top  /
sd          B.54 utt3: {C or } they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever [ they, + ]  /
sd          B.54 utt4: {C because } it was woodwork  /
sd          B.54 utt5: {C so } it looked as if it had been painted,   

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  correctly with, {D you know, } {F uh, } an enamel or something,  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C but, } {F um, } it had not,  /
sd          B.56 utt3: either that or it had not been prepared underneath  /
sd          B.56 utt4: {C and } it was greasy or  something, /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  it comes off in strips,  {E I mean } not even little bit.  /
sd          B.58 utt2:  {C So } we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off <laughter> all this time, /  

ba          A.59 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  we know what a job it's going to be  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C because } you almost have to strip the whole thing,   

b         A.61 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.62 utt1:  in order to do it again. /  

fc          A.63 utt1:  I wish you good luck. /  

fc          B.64 utt1:  Okay <laughter>. /  

fc          A.65 utt1:  Thank you very much. /
