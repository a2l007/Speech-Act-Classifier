ad          B.1 utt1:  {D Well, } [ in the norman-, + in a normal ]  route of way we do things, how about the ladies go first? /  

aa          A.2 utt1:  All righty <laughter>.  /
sd          A.2 utt2: {F Um, }  {D well, } I, {F uh, } have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year,  /
sd          A.2 utt3: {C  so } I'm really just starting to get involved [ in, +  {F uh, } in ]  what's out there and how they do things.  /
sv          A.2 utt4:  {F Um, } as far as the system as a whole, I really don't see a problem with it.  /
sv          A.2 utt5:   I do see a problem with graduating people [ that,  +  that ] can't read and are not, {D you know, } productive in society or productive to themselves  /
sv          A.2 utt6:  {C and, } {F uh, } I think that's the main problem at this point.   /
qo          A.2 utt7:  How about yourself? /  

aa          B.3 utt1:  All right.  /
sd          B.3 utt2: I [ 'm, +  live ] in Plano, Texas  /
sv          B.3 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, }   

b          A.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.5 utt1:  {F uh, } today we're not even suppose   to be in school because [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] way the taxation and all that crap is,  there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.7 utt1:  {D So, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ when you, +   when you ] take, {F uh, } {F uh, } professionals  and put them in situations, they have to make decisions  based on money to fund public education,  /
sv          B.7 utt2: {C and } they can't get their  finger out of their ear long enough [ to, +  to ] get that major subject in line,  /
sv          B.7 utt3: something's wrong.  /
sv          B.7 utt4:   {C So, } I think here in Texas mainly that [ [ the, + the, ] + they're ] not serious,  /
sv          B.7 utt5:  they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for [ what, +   how ] the level of education should be for children.  /
sd          B.7 utt6:   I have a one year old  /
sd          B.7 utt7: {C so } [ I'm not, +  I'm ] more opinionated about the observations  [ than, +  than ] the true facts,  /
sv          B.7 utt8: {C but, }    

b          A.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.9 utt1:  it's just a shame to me [ that, +  that ]   [ the, +  our ] firemen,  our policemen,  and  school teachers are the three least paid utilities,  {F um, } that have the biggest impact to our well-being. /  

aa          A.10 utt1:  That's true. /

%          B.11 utt2:   {F Um, } I think that if from every year [ when they, +  when they ] pull in [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the, ]  {F uh, } test that the last three years, {D you know, } ten, eleven, twelve [ year, +  {F uh, }  graders ] take,  /
sd          B.11 utt3:  [ {C and, } +  {C and  then } ] you see that their education is below the norm  throughout of all fifty states.  /
sv          B.11 utt4: They're not saying that something's wrong  with the educational system here in Texas,  /
sd          B.11 utt5: I have a real concern about that, {F um, }  /
sd          B.11 utt6:  as a matter of fact I'm very content to spend   my daughter out of state to college in Virginia,   

b          A.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.13 utt1:  {F uh, } verses   having her go down here  and not learn anything,  /
sd          B.13 utt2: [ {C and then, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] [ [ I'm, +  ((   ))  my opinion ] +  I think ]   there's a big concern  /
sd          B.13 utt3: [ hope, +  hopefully ] the new, {F uh, } [ education, +  secretary of education ]  will do something to fix the problem  /
h          B.13 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sv          B.13 utt5:  they've got to quit worrying about, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } religious, {F uh, } overtones in our textbooks  and get on with teaching the product. /  

aa          A.14 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.14 utt2: I think they get bogged down in  a lot of small issues that [ people, +  {D you know, } special interest groups ] can blow up,    

b          B.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.16 utt1:  [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]  not really get down to teaching what's important.  /
sv          A.16 utt2:  Teaching these kids, {D you know, } [ how + ]  ((   ))  really  the basics is what it comes down to. /  

aa          B.17 utt1:  Exactly.  /
sd          B.17 utt2:  I was astonished to find out  [ that, +  that ] across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed. /  

bh          A.18 utt1: Is that right? /  

sd         B.19 utt1:  [ Ha-, + ] [ [ they don't even, +   a lot of the school systems don't even, ] +  {F uh, } the kids nowadays don't even ] know [ what, +  what ]  the president's fitness education program is all about, /  

b         A.20 utt1:  {F Huh. } /

b          A.28 utt1:  {F Huh. } /
