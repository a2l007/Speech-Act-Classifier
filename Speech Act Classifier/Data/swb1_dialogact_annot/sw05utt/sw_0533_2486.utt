sv          A.26 utt1:  {C And } I think that does make a difference,  /

b          B.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.28 utt1:  {F uh, } I think [ you, + ] [ the, + the ] tendency there is to wear dresses and suits [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } more classical style of clothing. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qw          A.30 utt1:  What about the mini skirt? /  

sd          B.31 utt1:  There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work.  /

sv          B.31 utt7: {C but, } for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans  /
sv          B.31 utt8: [ just because it's, + maybe it's just because  ] of the sexist views and everything  /
sv          B.31 utt9: {C but } you just feel like [ you're, + you're  ] [ being, + showing ] too much le-, - /

%          B.33 utt5: {C but, } {F um, } -/  

b          A.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.35 utt1:  for me [ I just, + I just,  ] [ cou-, + wouldn't ] want to do that. /  

sv          A.36 utt1:  {D Well } there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts. /  

b          B.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.38 utt1:  There are some that are really short  /
sv          A.38 utt2: {C and then } there are some that may be  will come like four inches or five inches above the knee. /  

b          B.39 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sd          B.39 utt2: that's what I've seen.  /

sv          A.40 utt1:  {C and } again it depends upon the size, the shape of the person,    

b          B.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.42 utt1:  as well as the shape of the person's legs. /  

b          B.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.44 utt1:  {D Now, } I also, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.44 utt2: even though I retired from education, [ I, + {F uh, } I  ] do modeling  /
sd          A.44 utt3: {C and } I teach at a modeling agency here. /  

b          B.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.46 utt1:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C so, } ] when we are doing wardrobing and we have, {F uh, } [ two, + two ] hour classes in wardrobe, we do discuss a great deal, the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job. /  

b          B.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.48 utt1:  {F Uh, } even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through, {F uh, } grandmothers,    

b          B.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.50 utt1:  in my class.   /
sd          A.50 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } [ whe-, + ] I always try to emphasize the, clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad, /  

b          B.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.52 utt1:  {C because } maybe [ they, + those ] are not the clothes  that are the most, {F uh, } appealing to you, or the most, {F uh, } complimentary to you. /  

aa          B.53 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.54 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want. /  

b          B.55 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

sv          A.56 utt1:  [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] [ then, + {F uh, } then  ] you're in the situation where you're very unhappy. /  

 b         B.57 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
 sv         B.57 utt2:  {D Well } I feel like too, on the job, when, {D you know, } there's men around and some of the managers are men, [ you just, + {D you know, } you  ] don't want them looking at your legs <laughter> necessarily. /  

aa          A.58 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd         B.59 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work,  /
%          B.59 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

sd          A.60 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] have to, {F uh, } agree with that, even when they was   very,  very  popular in the early sixties, /  

b          B.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.62 utt1:  {F uh, } I, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sd          A.62 utt2: again maybe because I was at the school, there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts, /  

b          B.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.64 utt1:  {F uh, } we had no regulation against it  /
sd          A.64 utt2: {C and } a lot of the kids did of course,  /
sd          A.64 utt3: {C and } it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers. /  

b          B.65 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

sd          A.66 utt1:  {C Because } they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts. /  

b          B.67 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.68 utt1:  {C And so, } I think, {F uh, } {F uh, } of course, now I go the other extreme,  I do not like to see, in the corporate areas, {F uh, } all the women dressed like men,   

b          B.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.70 utt1:  with the suits and, {F uh, } white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same. /  

b          B.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.72 utt1:  {F Uh, } I don't like that,  /
%          A.72 utt2: I don't, - /
sv          A.72 utt3: I think there should be individuality in dressing. /  

b          B.73 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.73 utt2:  Even with the very tailored look of a suit, sometimes I like to have [ someth-, +  [ a lit-, + just a little ] something ] that's feminine. /  

aa          A.74 utt1:  Yes. /  

%          B.75 utt1:  Not, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.75 utt2: you don't want to over do it but, just a little, a touch of it just to say, yes, I am a woman, /  

aa          A.76 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.77 utt1:  {C but } I can be professional too. /  

sv         A.78 utt1:  [ {D Well, }  I, + ] {C and } I ]  don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored [  to, + to  ] look professional. /  

aa          B.79 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.79 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          A.80 utt1:  I think that [ you, + you ] make of that what you wish  /
sv          A.80 utt2: {C and } you can go the opposite direction and, {F uh, } over do   all the frills and laces and flounces and  what have you, which don't belong  [ in the, +  [ in, + at least in my opinion, in the  ] ] work place, /  

b          B.81 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.82 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } [ that, + that ] - /
sv          A.82 utt2: you can have a classical look without  [ a lot of, + a great deal of  ] adornment  and what have you and still be very feminine. /  

b          B.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.84 utt1:  {C Because } that was one thing I always fought against.  /
sd          A.84 utt2: I started out as a physical education teacher. /  

b          B.85 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.86 utt1:  {C So } I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish, /  

b          B.87 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.88 utt1:   {F uh, } {C and } people would never, ever guess that I was Phys Ed  /
sd          A.88 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {F um, } {C and } ] that pleased me, /  

b          B.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.90 utt1:  {F uh, } {C and so, } then I, of course, just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work  /
sd          A.90 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] I find [ even, + even  ] at home here now, [ I,  I  ] will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you, {F uh, }  and  be very comfortable  /
sd          A.90 utt3: {C but } when I go out somewhere, then, {F uh, } unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans. /  

b          B.91 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.92 utt1:  I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how. /  

b          B.93 utt1:  Uh-huh  <breathing>. /  

sv          A.94 utt1:  {C And, so, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I just feel that, {F uh, } {D you know } each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort. /  

b          B.95 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.96 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } there are certain norms that companies should be able to, {F uh, } put out as guidelines for their employees. /  

aa          B.97 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.97 utt2: that's [ what I, + one thing I  ] like about T I is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear  /
sd          B.97 utt3: {C and } [ they don't, +  {D you know, }  your boss doesn't ] come up to you and say now remember, tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit. /  

x          A.98 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.99 utt1:  {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] leave it up to you and your judgment  [ to, +

b          A.102 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.103 utt1:  The only real restrictions they have are, {F uh, } no halter tops and no shorts, even the long walking short of the squirts, [ the, + the ] split skirts,   

b          A.104 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.105 utt1:  anything [ that, + that ] could be considered shorts they don't allow. /

sv          B.109 utt2: {C and } I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual  /
sv          B.109 utt3: {C and } it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day. /  

b          A.110 utt1:  Yes. /
