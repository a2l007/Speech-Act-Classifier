sd         @A.2 utt2: {C and } I thought that was a good way,  /
sd         @A.2 utt3: {C but } I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things.  /
sd         @A.2 utt4: {D You know, }  it's a week or two late,  /
sd         @A.2 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } that's how I'm staying up. /  

sd         B.3 utt1:  I either watch the news  /
sd         B.3 utt2: [ {C or, } + {C or } ] occasionally I'll read the paper. /  

qy          A.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } do you like how it's presented on the news? /  

nn          B.5 utt1:  {F Um, } no,  /
sv^e          B.5 utt2: I think the media's a little bit too manipulative.  /

sv          B.5 utt4: [ they, + they ] try to lead you too much, I believe,  /

sv          B.5 utt7: I think they're a little bit biased sometimes.  /
sd          B.5 utt8: Like for example, [ the Kennedy, + the Kennedy ] rape case.  /
sv          B.5 utt9:  The coverage on that was, {D you know, } - /

aa          B.7 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.7 utt2:  [ [ [ It's, + it's, ] + it's, ] instead of reporting the news, + it's ] more like an editorial, I believe --   

b          A.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.9 utt1:  -- on a lot of issues. /  

sd          A.10 utt1:  I've noticed that too,  /
qy^g          A.10 utt2: {C and } it's kind of distressing, isn't it? /  

ny          B.11 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.12 utt1:  {C And } [ they just, + I've noticed that they do it just ]  with subtle little words, {F uh, } usually, {F uh, }  just  that sway the whole, {F uh, } report [ that, + ] {D you know, } by just a couple of words. /  

sd          B.13 utt1:  {D Well, } [ when, + when ] I was in school, [ I, + {F um, } I ] was a communications major,  /

sd          B.19 utt4:  {C So } [ that, + that's ] another source [ that [ I, + I, ] + where I ] keep up with current events  /

sd^e          B.27 utt3: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] primarily deal with the state employees,  /
sd          B.27 utt4: {C but } [ I, + I ] find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as [ the, + {D like } the ] state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.   /
sd          B.27 utt5: {C And } I really know what the budget is,   /
sd          B.27 utt6: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } {F uh, } when they were saying we were so poor and  they couldn't pay taxes, and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that,  /

sv          B.27 utt13: {C but, } {D you know, } it's not always [ I, + I ] think one hundred percent reliable. /  

qo          A.28 utt1:  Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective? /  

sv          B.29 utt1:  I think they need to [ do a little bit, + go into a little bit ] more depth, {F uh, } before they would just report,  {D like } somebody wants to make a statement or  something like that,  /
sd          B.29 utt2: {C because } {E I mean, } another example is the, {F uh, } AIDS issue or  whatever.  /

sd          B.29 utt7: [ before they, + before they ] come out with something like that they need [ to, + to ] research the matter, I believe, a little bit more. /  

sv          A.30 utt1:  I guess they do that so they don't get scooped, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.30 utt2: {C so } they have the big story. /
