sv          A.31 utt1:  {D Well, } {D see } the problem [ is, + is ] that, {F um, } <clicking> what happens is [ as, + ] that [ you're, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } as you ] go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right? /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {C Because } in the country, people still respect, {F uh, } the property of other people. /

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  {D Now } what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: {C and } they rush to get the same thing.  /
sv          A.37 utt3: They say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,  /
sv          A.37 utt4: {C and } the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,  /
sv          A.37 utt5: {C and } what we have to do is, we have to go, {F uh, } get some stuff, steal it, and then, {D you know, } just resell it. /  

bf          B.38 utt1:  It's easy,  /
sv          B.38 utt2: you said the magic word there. /

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C And } that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  [ That's, + {F uh, } that's, ] {F uh, } the main reason I think, {F uh, } everywhere  /
sv          A.43 utt2: {C because, } {F uh, } you have deaths.  /
sv          A.43 utt3:  {E I mean, }  {E I mean, }  you have murders  /
sv          A.43 utt4: {C and } you have, {D you know, } people stealing other people's stuff,  /
%          A.43 utt5: {C and } that's - /
sv          A.43 utt6: a lot of it has to do with drugs. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes. /  

%          A.45 utt1:  It doesn't have to do, - /
sv          A.45 utt2: {E I mean, } the thing [ is + is ] that, {D you know, } it's like  you might be standing somewhere, right,  /
sv          A.45 utt3: {C and } {D like } let's say    [ [ [ you, +   you're, ] +  you're, ] +   {D you know, } you're ]   driving out  /

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } somebody walks in there with a gun.  /
sv          A.47 utt2:  {E I mean, } they're going to want the money,  /
sv          A.47 utt3: {C and } you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs.  /
sv          A.47 utt4: {E I mean, } they don't want the money [ so, + {F uh, } so ] they can do something else with it. /  

aa          B.48 utt1:  No,  /
sv          B.48 utt2: they don't want the money for food,  /
sv          B.48 utt3: that's for sure. /

sv          B.50 utt1:  # {D Well, } {C but } {D you know, } [ the, + # the ] [ strange thing, +  {F uh, } perhaps, not strange, but  something that many people don't realize, ] is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C because, } {F uh, } I'm a retired educator. /  

bk          A.51 utt1:  Okay <noise>. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  {C And, } in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers --

+          B.54 utt1:  -- outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started,  and so on, and so on.  /
sv          B.54 utt2:  {C So } it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,  /
sv          B.54 utt3: {C and } we're just really, {F uh, } {F uh, } now, trying to, {F uh, } figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          A.55 utt3: it's like, in, {F uh, } nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America,  /
sv          A.55 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } their figures, I think are [ too, +  so ] - /
sv          A.55 utt5: {E I mean } it's like,  [ compared to, + {D you know, } compared to, ] weapons or stuff like that, {E I mean, } you're spending nothing [ on, + on ] crime in the country itself.  /
%          A.55 utt6:  What you're doing is, you, {D you know, } - /

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah  /
sv          B.58 utt2: {C and } another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs,   

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
