qo          @A.1 utt1:  {D So, } how do you feel about our policy in Latin America?  <Laughter>. /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {F Oh, } I'm all in favor of it,  /

ar          B.2 utt3:  No,  /
sv          B.2 utt4: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] think we've been doing a pretty good job, {D you know, }  [ not, + {F uh, } not  ]  taking advantage [ of our, + {D you know, } of  ] the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us,  {D you know, } {F uh, }  /
sv          B.2 utt5: {E I mean } we could direct the government even more than we have been.  /
sv          B.2 utt6: I don't  think we've been doing too bad. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah.  /

sv          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } I think [ that, + {F uh, } as a whole that  ] [ the, +   being that [ the  drug problem, +  the drug industry ] ] can, {F uh, } bring so  much money to a country. - /
sv          B.6 utt2: I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that [ the g-, + the ] drug, {F uh, } cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Yeah  <<pause>>. /

sv          A.13 utt3: I just  (( get sorry ))  feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about, {D you know, }  our intervention and their government <baby_crying> and stuff like that, /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C and } [ he, + he ] was all for it because it's just like you say, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.15 utt2: there's so  many people there [ that, + that ] get the kind of control  that's bad, {D you know, } /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {C and } that their governments can become so corrupt  /

sv          A.19 utt3: {C or, } {D you know, } [ [ why, + why, ] + why ] intervene in another country's, {D you know, } problems and things like that.  /
sv          A.19 utt4:   [ Why, + why ] should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that  /
sv          A.19 utt5: {C but } I think just a lot of times if we don't [ [ then, + then ] it, + then that ] influence will affect our country too for one.  /
sv          A.19 utt6:  {C And } for two, {D you know, } <baby_crying> that it does help.  /
sv          A.19 utt7: {E I mean, } {D you know, } I think the people in those country do want our help.   The people that are under conditions that are, {D you know, } not favorable to [ this +  their ] rights. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  Right.  /

%          A.25 utt2:   {E I mean } I'd rather, - /
sv          A.25 utt3: even if a country chooses a government that's not, {D you know, } exactly the kind of government that we have, {D you know } [ or, + or ] as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, [ as long, + as long ] it's one [ that's, <<pause>> + [ that, + that  ] ]  makes since, so to speak, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.25 utt4: it is a government that stays in power, that can stay in power,  /
sv          A.25 utt5: {C but } it seems like most of them don't </baby_crying>,    

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /

+          B.72 utt1:  where it's always the minority that [ are, + are ] trying to make the country better. /

sd          A.73 utt3: {D well, } I guess I do in a way,  /
sv          A.73 utt4: sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that.  /
sv          A.73 utt5: I think [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } because of those [ co-, + countries ] [ a lot, + ] {D you know, } where such Catholic influence. - /
sv          A.73 utt6: {C And } I think the Catholic religion itself [ was, + was ] such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down,   

x          B.74 utt1:  <Breathing>.   

+          A.75 utt1:  so to speak, /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  I thought,

+          B.78 utt1:  it was the other way around.  /
sv          B.78 utt2:  They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this,  /
sv          B.78 utt3: {C so } all the persecution that they're sort of use to it,  it's been,

sv          A.81 utt1:  [ [ {C But, } +  {C but } ] +  {D see, } {C but } ] I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion, as far as through the ages has been the rule, so to speak.   /

x          B.82 utt1:  <Breathing>.   

sv          A.83 utt1:  {E I mean } when you   a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said [ yet they're, + yet they're ] expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, {D you know. } /
