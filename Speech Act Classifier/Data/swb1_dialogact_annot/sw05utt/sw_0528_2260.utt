o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
^h          A.1 utt2: let's see.  /
%          A.1 utt3:  I think, {F uh, } - /
sv^t          A.1 utt4: I guess, if I call I'm supposed to start.  /
sd^t          A.1 utt5: I think, {F uh, } that's the way everybody has done it so far. /  

aa          B.2 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          A.3 utt1:  {C But, } anyway I think that, {F um, } we are paying a lot in taxes,  /
sv          A.3 utt2: {C but } I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms,  and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: {F Um, }  we're probably one of  [ the, + the  ] only countries in the world that has all the things that we have.  /
%          A.3 utt4: The, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.3 utt5: as far as the quality of the streets, the school systems, {F um, } the hospital stuff that the government gives money to.  {F Um, } the, {D you know, } all the things that the government does like that.  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] think they need to manage it a little bit better,  /
sv          A.3 utt6: {C but } I don't think, {F uh, } anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks,  because  they've been messing it up for many years, now.  /
%          A.3 utt7: {C So, } -/  

aa*          B.4 utt1:  I have to agree that <laughter>. /  *[[listen]]

aa          B.6 utt1:  {C And } you're right.  /
sv          B.6 utt2: [ [ We, + {E I mean, } we, ] + {D you know, } we ] do have a good government.  /
sv          B.6 utt3: We do have a lot of things [ that, + {D you know, } that, ] {D you know, } the taxes are there to support,  /
sv          B.6 utt4: {C but } I do think they're mismanaged  /
sv          B.6 utt5: {C and } I think that sometimes it's [ too easy of a, + I don't know, to easy of an ] answer.  /
sv          B.6 utt6: It seems to say, I'll tax them if you can't get enough money, instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending [ or, + or, ] {D you know, } get all of the waste out of the spending. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

qh          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas,  /

%          B.8 utt3: {D you know } there's a, - /
sv          B.8 utt4: the taxes set by, {D you know, } the state and the city can add theirs,  /
sv          B.8 utt5: {C and } the county adds theirs,  /
sv         B.8 utt6: {C and, } {D you know, } we're paying almost eight percent sales tax, right now.  Which seems to me nuts.  /
sd          B.8 utt7: I came from California  /
sd         B.8 utt8: {C and, } {D you know, } when I left there, we paid six cents on the dollar,  /
sd          B.8 utt9: {C and } that was {D like } one of the highest in the nation. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Right.  /

sd          B.16 utt1:  It drives me crazy.  /
sv(^q)          B.16 utt2: I'm thinking, {D you know, } everybody is sitting here screaming about, we don't want a state income tax,  /
sv          B.16 utt3: {C but } yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up  /
sv          B.16 utt4: {C and } they don't do anything about it.    

aa          A.17 utt1:  Right. /

ny          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there. /

sd          A.35 utt3: I can think of all the biblical things about it, too.  /

sd          A.35 utt5: I can't think of the scripture.  /

sd          A.37 utt1:  {D So, } {D you know, } [ even, + even  ] in the story where they had to pay the taxes, the disciples,   

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  and, {F uh, } Jesus said the money in the fishes mouth or in the fisher, inside the fish.  /
sd          A.39 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } I thought of those two things when [ I was, + I was ] holding for a long time. /

ny          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } {F um, } back then what they tried to do, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.44 utt2: the  ((   )) would always try to stump Jesus, try to give him something that would contradict himself, /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C And so } that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation.  /
sd(^q)          B.46 utt2: {C And, } of course, that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's,  /  
^q          B.46 utt3: you render unto God what is God's. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Right. /

sd          A.65 utt1:  All the deductions and all that. /  

qy          B.66 utt1:  Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act, it seemed like it made everything harder? /  

ny          A.67 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd^e          A.67 utt2:  It really did. /  

x          B.68 utt1:  <Laughter>.    

sd          A.69 utt1:  [ I, + I ] saw,  that, too. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  I didn't notice anything simplified about it, except that they took away the deductions,    

b          A.71 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.72 utt1:  the interest and,    

b          A.73 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.74 utt1:  other things <laughter>. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  We're looking at buying a house, /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C And } that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house. /  

sv          B.78 utt1:  {C And } it will help tremendously. /  

b          A.79 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.80 utt1:  We bought ours five years ago  /
%          B.80 utt2: {C and } it's - /
%          B.80 utt3: the one thing, - /
sv          B.80 utt4: it seems like you make those payments every month  /
sv          B.80 utt5: {C and } at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles. /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.82 utt1:  {C So } that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back. /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.83 utt2:  There's a thing  I just, - /
sd          A.83 utt3: I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it,  /
%          A.83 utt4: if you pay, - /
sd          A.83 utt5: I know I get paid twice a month, every two weeks, /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.85 utt1:  that's once a month. /

sd          A.87 utt1:  {D Well, } I get twenty six paychecks,    

aa          B.88 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.89 utt1:  which would come out to be in thirteen months.  /
sv          A.89 utt2:  {C So } if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks,   

b          B.90 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.91 utt1:  Instead of once a month, you'll come out paying [ a, + ] {F uh, } one month extra every year. /  

aa          B.92 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          A.93 utt1:  {C And } [ it will, + if have you a thirty year note, it will ] take like seven or  plus years off of your note. /  

aa          B.94 utt1:  That's right.  /
sd          B.94 utt2: My parents, {F uh, } bought a home in San Diego about four or  five years ago, /  

x          A.95 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.    

sd          B.96 utt1:  {C And } they did that.  /
sd          B.96 utt2: They thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other Wednesday, /  

b          A.97 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

aa          B.98 utt1:  {C And } that's exactly right.  /
%          B.98 utt2:  Everyone, - /
sd          B.98 utt3: though the note is thirty years,  she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years,    

b          A.99 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.100 utt1:  or something like that. /  

b          A.101 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.102 utt1:  Just because of exactly what you said, /  

b          A.103 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.104 utt1:  You're making one more months payment every year. /  

sd          A.105 utt1:  {C And } that's going on the principle,  /
sd          A.105 utt2: it doesn't pay any interest, /  

b          B.106 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.107 utt1:  {C or, }

b          A.111 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.112 utt1:  {C And } when we bought this house, we looked at doing a fifteen year note, because it added more to the payment,    

b          A.113 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.114 utt1:  but not significant amounts, {D you know, }  /
