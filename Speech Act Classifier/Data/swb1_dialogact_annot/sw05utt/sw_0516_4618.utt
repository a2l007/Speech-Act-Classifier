ad          A.1 utt1:  Go ahead <laughter>. /  

qr          B.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } have you every been tested for a new job or anything? /  

nn          @A.3 utt1:  {F Uh, } no  /
sd^e          @A.3 utt2: I haven't.   /
sd          @A.3 utt3: {C But, } in my job, {A I'm a nurse,  and } we are allowed to be.  /
sd          @A.3 utt4: {E I mean, } {D you know, } this is the rules that they can do this anytime.  /
sd          @A.3 utt5:  {F Uh, }  I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. /  

%          B.4 utt1:  {C So } it's just sort of, {F uh, } - /
%          B.4 utt2:   they  can if they, -/  

sd^m          A.5 utt1:  They can if they choose to. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Right.  /
qy          A.7 utt2:  [ Have you, + {D well }  (( {F wai-, } ))  have you  ] had any experience with it at all? /  

ng          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } not really  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C but } I've always worked on a university level  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but } a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qo          A.9 utt2:  {C So } what do you think about that? /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ I don't, + I don't  ] think they're very accurate  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C because, } {E I mean, } I know their lifestyles changed [ p-, + prior  ] to the drug test  /
sd          B.10 utt3: {C and } I know they changed afterwards. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  Right,  /
aa^r          A.11 utt2: right.   /
sd          A.11 utt3: {D See } I know of that too.  /
sd          A.11 utt4: {C And } I also know that things like  antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off.  /
sd          A.11 utt5: {C And } you cannot get a job because of it  /
sv@          A.11 utt6: {C and } they may not tell you the reason why.   *[[slash error]]

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: [ I, + I ] had a friend,  /
sd          B.12 utt3: it didn't cause her any problems with her job  /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C but } it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {C But } what it was, was [ she had been u-, + she had been, ] {F uh, } in the jungle  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and }  it was some Malaria medication  /
sd          B.14 utt3: {C and } she tested positive for that. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  {D See, } {C and so } it really is a dangerous thing that way  /
sd          A.15 utt2: {C because } I know of somebody that tested for an airline  and  didn't get the job  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and } they weren't told why.   /
sv          A.15 utt4: {C But } a lot of people say the reason why, after  you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing  /
sv          A.15 utt5: or they would tell you.  /
sv          A.15 utt6: Or  this person never use any drugs. /  

%          B.16 utt1:  {D See, } I always, - /
sv          B.16 utt2:  I  thought [ they got, + you got ] called back if you tested positive, for more tests. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  {F Uh, } you should.  /
sv          A.17 utt2: {C Because } you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something.  /
sd          A.17 utt3: I have real mixed feelings about it.  /
sd          A.17 utt4:  I don't know. /  

qy          B.18 utt1:  [ How, + do you know how  ] wrong they are?  /
qy          B.18 utt2:  [ Are they, + {E I mean, }  is  there ] a # margin of error? # /  

br          A.19 utt1:  # The accuracy? #  /
no          A.19 utt2: I don't know.  /
no^r          A.19 utt3: I don't know.  /
sd          A.19 utt4: {C But, } I know there are a lot of things that can influence them  /
sv          A.19 utt5: {C and } I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something  because  most things will stay in your system for a long time. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C And } if you could show that, - /
sd          A.21 utt2: [ I, + I ] interviewed for a job recently  /
sd          A.21 utt3: {C and } I was taking Entex.   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  {C And } my doctor gave me a prescription for it.  /
sd(^q)          A.23 utt2:  {C And } he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C And } it didn't come up that I needed to do it  /
sv          A.23 utt4: {C but } this could happen to anybody  /
sv          A.23 utt5: {C and } if they would just say {F oh, } this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them --   

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- {D you know. }  Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          A.27 utt1:  # {C So } I don't know. # /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  # {C And } [ I, + I'm ] not # so sure they are that needed. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  Yeah,  /

%@          B.30 utt1:  # {E I mean, } #   *[[need a slash]]

+          A.31 utt1:  -- sure either.  /
sv          A.31 utt2: The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it  /
sd          A.31 utt3: {C because } they say they can spot check. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  Ye-, - /  *[[b]]
sv          B.32 utt2: if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C But } the occasional person, then [ it's almost + {D like, } it's almost ] an infringement of your privacy. /  

aap          A.35 utt1:  {D Well, } it sort of is.  /
o          A.35 utt2:  {C And } this is it,  /
%          A.35 utt3: this, - /
sd          A.35 utt4: I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways.  /
sv          A.35 utt5: {D You know, }  as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  {D You know, } {C so } as a patient, I feel {D well, } {D yeah, }  we probably should be protected.  /
sv          A.37 utt2: {C But, } on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too.  /
sv          A.37 utt3: {C So } <laughter> --     

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- {D you know, } I guess [ you sort  of, +  you ] have to have trust some place along the way.  /
sv          A.39 utt2: You can't go around testing everybody for everything. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah  <sniffing>. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  {C So, } I don't know.  /
sv          A.41 utt2: {C And } [ I, + I ] think it could be used to hassle somebody.  /
sv          A.41 utt3: If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this.  /
sv          A.41 utt4: {D You know, } they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess.  /
sv          A.41 utt5:  I can see where it could become a problem. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C And } [ [ it, + it's ] like, + it seems like ] now they have tests <<mispronounced>>  /
sd          B.42 utt2: I guess they can test your hair  /
sd          B.42 utt3: and they can find out if you use drugs --   

b          A.43 utt1:  Really. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  -- up to several years ago. /  

ba@          A.45 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow!  #  {C But } # --   *[[two utts]]

%          B.46 utt1:  # {C So, } # -/  

+          A.47 utt1:  -- maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. /  *[[sv]]

aa          B.48 utt1:  I know. /  

o          A.49 utt1:  That's the other thing.   /
sd          A.49 utt2: {E I mean } [ a lot of, + a lot of ] people as kids or,  {D you know, } young people get into some things that they get out of later on  /
sv          A.49 utt3: {C and } I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. /  

aa          B.50 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.50 utt2:  There's a lot of things you do as a kid # that # --     

b          A.51 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.52 utt1:  -- you wouldn't do as an adult  /
sv          B.52 utt2:  {C but } --   

aa          A.53 utt1:  # I think that's true. # /  

+          B.54 utt1:  -- # you can't say it was # wrong at the time. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.55 utt2: yeah.  /
sv          A.55 utt3:  {C So } that probably wouldn't be too good either. /
