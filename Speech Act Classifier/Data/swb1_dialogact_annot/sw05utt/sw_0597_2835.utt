========================================================================
  

sv          A.1 utt1:  It seems to me that one of the biggest  differences is the computer revolution. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  {C And, } I can very clearly remember  ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office [ and, + and ]  trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  {C and } we did end up with, {F uh, } I B M, P C -s, which I now would not have chosen <laughter>, /  

bh          B.4 utt1:  Really? /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {C But } that was before the Macintosh. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C And } twenty years ago I was, {F uh, }  in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter <laughter>. /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know it. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C So } I would say that's one of the  largest changes [ in, +  at least in ] my life. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.10 utt2: [ I, + I've ] seen that just  in the last, {F uh, } even five years how much they've [ in-, +  {F uh, } increased ] in use.  {C Or } probably eight years,  /
sd         B.10 utt3: when I was a freshman in college --    

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- {F uh, } my degree was in computer,  {F uh, } technology originally  /
%          B.12 utt2: {C and } it seemed like it would, - /
sd          B.12 utt3: they were just getting out with  [ the, + {D you know, } the ] disks and all that, getting away with the cards,   

b          A.13 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.14 utt1:  # {D you # know, } doing away with  [ the, + the ] programming cards -- /  

bk          A.15 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.16 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: thirty years ago [ I, +  I ]  had a college job, {F uh, } working as a programmer  /
sd          A.17 utt3: {C and } we had to write code in binary  /
sd          A.17 utt4:  and, {F uh, } have it punched in on those little cardboard cards <laughter> which,   

aa          B.18 utt1:  # I know.  # /  

+          A.19 utt1:  # I don't # think exists anymore. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  No. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  You never see one of those punch cards anymore. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {F Uh, } I think T V has a lot to do  with the changes, too. Don't you? In, {D like, } people's attitudes. /  

aap          A.23 utt1:  {D Well, } very possibly.  /
sv          A.23 utt2:  {F Uh, } I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before.  /
sv          A.23 utt3: {F Uh, }   certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes. [ Even, + even ]   the change from black and white to color television. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  Thirty years ago I guess there were  color T V -s,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C but } I sure didn't have access to one. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ]  twenty years ago, practically everybody had a color T V,  /
%          A.27 utt2: {C and } now I think they're [ as, +  almost as ] many, {D well, } - /
sd          A.27 utt3:  there are more T V -s than households,  /
sd          A.27 utt4: {C so } --   

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah  /
x          B.28 utt2: <laughter>.  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- it's close to getting, {F uh, }  one T V per person they say <laughter>. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } now everybody, {F uh, } has V C R -s and two  or three V C R -s --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- and that kind of thing. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  Certainly ten years ago, {F uh, }  V C R -s were just coming on the market  /
sv          A.33 utt3: {C so } that's made a significant difference in  the way I watch television for instance,  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C because, } {F uh, } now I almost  never watch a T V program when it's on. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa          B.34 utt2:  I know. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient  /
sd          A.35 utt2:  {C and } that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted.  /
sd          A.35 utt3:  I can just put it on pause <laughter>. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C and } [ you can, +  you can ]  flip through the commercials  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C so } you don't have to watch the commercials. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  That's always [ h-, + ] convenient. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          A.39 utt2:  Yes,  /
sd          A.39 utt3: you can watch a program  in forty-five minutes instead of an hour <laughter>.  /
sd          A.39 utt4: You skip the commercials. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh <laughter>.  /
qw^t          B.40 utt2: {D So, } what was our  question about, decline in socio-, -/  

arp          A.41 utt1:  Wasn't the decline so much.  /
sd^t          A.41 utt2:  I think they just said the [ changes in, +  {F uh, }  [ social, + social ] changes  in ] the United States. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd^t          A.43 utt1:  How was life different ten, twenty, or  thirty years ago.  /
%          A.43 utt2: {C So, } -/  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } I can't really remember back  that far,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C but } <breathing> ten years ago, {F uh, } I don't know. I'd say, {D like } in the  nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with A M, what do you  call those, little A M radios -- /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  -- {C and } now people have jam box with  C D players in them, {D you know. }    

aa          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter>  Yes.  /
sv          A.47 utt2: That's certainly,   

+          B.48 utt1:  # And, #   

+          A.49 utt1:  # a # difference. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  hand held T V -s and car phones. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa         A.51 utt2: that's another one,  /
aa         A.51 utt3: yeah,  /
sv          A.51 utt4:  car phones is a good point,  and, {F uh, } cellular phones of all types and beepers.  /
sd          A.51 utt5: {F Uh, }    

b          B.52 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.53 utt1:  # ten # years ago I was working in a job   at a medical center  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C and } I had to carry a beeper around  /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C and } they were kind of  bulky  /
sd          A.53 utt4: {C and } all they did was just, {F uh, } make a beep noise  /
sd          A.53 utt5: {C and then } you had  to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and  who you were supposed to call. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  These days they have these tiny little  things that are only about the size of two or three pencils  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C and } they fit in  your shirt pocket  /
sd          A.55 utt3: {C and } they have a little display screen that shows you a message and  either tells you a person or [ a, +  a ] phone number to respond to  /
%          A.55 utt4: {C and, } -/  

sv          B.56 utt1:  Those are cool. /  

aa          A.57 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.57 utt2: those are pretty neat.  /
sd          A.57 utt3:   {C And } they have the kind that just vibrates so  you can shut them off,   

b          B.58 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.59 utt1:  # in # a theatre or something  /
sd          A.59 utt2:  {C and } you can still get your messages <laughter>. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

^h          A.61 utt1:  {C But, } let's see, social changes, {F uh, } {F uh, } /  

qw          B.62 utt1:  [ Where do you think it's, +  where do you think it's ]  going to go in twenty years? /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  I haven't the slightest idea.  /
sv          A.63 utt2:   I was just thinking, though, about [ a, +  a ] huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.65 utt1:  It was just beginning to be recognized  and noticed ten years ago.  /
sd          A.65 utt2:  [ I, +  I ] know that because I was writing a paper about it. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  I was writing [ a, +  a ] journal article.  /
sd          A.67 utt2:  {F Uh, } {C and } they still didn't even know what caused it or anything.  /
sd          A.67 utt3:   {C And, } {F uh, } there was a suspicion,   

ba          B.68 utt1:  # Wow.  # /  

+          A.69 utt1:  # that # it was a virus  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  {C but } nobody had identified it  /
sd          A.69 utt3: {C and } they were really just going on epidemiological, {F uh, }   

b          B.70 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.71 utt1:  # {F uh, } # guesswork, {F uh, }   because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like, {F uh, } hepatitis  /
sd          A.71 utt2: {C and then, }   

b          B.72 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.73 utt1:  # [ from, + # from ] the spread pattern  of hepatitis, they could work backwards to the transmission by, {F uh, } blood and semen.  /
%          A.73 utt2:  {C And then }  I, -/  

qw          B.74 utt1:  I'm curious what was your, {F uh, } graduate study in? /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] was in English  as a matter of fact,  and --   

ba          B.76 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow. /  

+          A.77 utt1:  -- medieval studies, /  

b          B.78 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  # {F uh, } # {C but } I went to work as an editor  and writer,  /
sd          A.79 utt2: {C so, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ the, + ] ten years ago I was working in the medical center,  {F uh, } publishing a journal and  writing about medical topics <laughter>. /  

b          B.80 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.81 utt1:  {C And, } let's see, twenty years ago,  I guess we [ 're +   were ] just beginning to get into what they were calling [ the, +   {F uh, } the ] sex revolution [ where, + ] {F uh } --   

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.83 utt1:  -- after the pill  /
sd          A.83 utt2:  {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } freed people up from worries about, {F uh, } illegitimate pregnancy  /
sd          A.83 utt3:  {C and, } I guess in the seventies is [ the, +  the ] time when that was supposed to have exploded.  /
sd          A.83 utt4:   Thirty years ago there was no pill. /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qy          B.84 utt2:  You think that's caused a  lot of pressure on, {D like } younger kids today,   

ny          A.85 utt1:  # Yes.  # /  

+          B.86 utt1:  # to # make choices that they  probably shouldn't have to make? /  

sd^e          A.87 utt1:  I do.  /
sd          A.87 utt2:  I really do.  /
sd          A.87 utt3:  I have, {F uh, }   

b          B.88 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.89 utt1:  # four # kids in college right now,  children and stepchildren  /
sd          A.89 utt2: {C and } I know that the expectation for them was, {F uh, }  to have sex  and, much earlier,   

b          B.90 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.91 utt1:  # than # the expectation when I was in college. /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.93 utt1:  In my day, we talked quietly behind  our hands about people that we suspected might be,   

b          B.94 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.95 utt1:  # sleeping # with their boyfriends <laughter>. /  

b          B.96 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.97 utt1:  {C But, } they certainly didn't expect  everybody to  /
sd          A.97 utt2: {C and } it was really only, {F uh, } acceptable if you were engaged  and planning to get married [ in, +  in ] the relatively near future. /  

b          B.98 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.99 utt1:  {C And } I certainly know from talking  to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays. /  

b          B.100 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
sd          B.100 utt2:  It's kind of scary  when I think of what will happen in twenty years, {D you know, } when I have kids  and they're grown and <<pause>> <breathing>, {F uh, } just kind of some of the changes that  will happen even more  /
%          B.100 utt3: {C so. } -/  

sv          A.101 utt1:  {C And } I guess the answer,   

sv          B.102 utt1:  # Seems like it can't get much worse.  # /  

+          A.103 utt1:  # [ is, +  is, ] stay flexible because  nobody can # predict what's going to happen in twenty years <laughter>. /  

b          B.104 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.105 utt1:  I certainly wouldn't have been able to  twenty years ago tell you what, {F uh, } my kids were likely to be like.  /
sd          A.105 utt2:  Course, one of them was just [ [ a, +  a, ] +  a ] brand new baby twenty years ago,  /
sd          A.105 utt3: {C so } <laughter>  --   

b          B.106 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.107 utt1:  -- I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.109 utt1:  {C And } some of the other ones weren't born. /  

b          B.110 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.110 utt2:  {D So, } sounds like America's  going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and --   

b          A.111 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.112 utt1:  -- worldwide communication  /
%          B.112 utt2: {C and, } -/  

sv          A.113 utt1:  Electronic mail. /  

b          B.114 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.115 utt1:  I just got on that this past, about a year  ago  /
sd          A.115 utt2: {C and } that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so  much easier to get hold of people and  get quick answers to things.    

b          B.116 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.117 utt1:  Even when they're on another continent. /  

sv          B.118 utt1:  <Laughter>  It's pretty wild. /  

b          A.119 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.119 utt2:  Even, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.119 utt3:  that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten years ago,  /
sd          A.119 utt4: {C but } it was used as kind of an extreme emergency -- /  

b          B.120 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.121 utt1:  -- {C and } nowadays people use Fed Ex, all the time. /  

aa          B.122 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa          B.122 utt2:  Sure do.  {F Huh. } /  

sv          A.123 utt1:  People do seem to travel more.  /
