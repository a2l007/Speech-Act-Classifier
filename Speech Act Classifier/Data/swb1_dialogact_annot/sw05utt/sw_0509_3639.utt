qy^d          A.13 utt1:  I was wondering where that came from  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C because } they're talking like it was an American built car. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: [ it, + it ] sounds like it, but it really isn't <laughter>. /

%          B.22 utt4: {C and } there is, - /
sd          B.22 utt5: it's so quiet, almost can't tell the engine is running. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  That's their big selling point, {F uh, } other than general luxury  /
sv          A.23 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {C but } ] the particular seems to be [ the, +  {F uh, } <noise> the ] quiet ride. /  

aa          B.24 utt1:  It really is.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: It's got pretty good acceleration, too. /

bk          A.29 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd^e          B.30 utt1:  {C But } there is not very many options on that car. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  There is only about five or six options.  /

sd         B.34 utt1:  # {F Uh, } some of the # tracking control things and skidding control things for up north.   

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  The C D and the premium sound system. /  

b^m          A.37 utt1:  Skidding control,  /
qy          A.37 utt2: you mean the antilock brake system? /  

ny          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.38 utt2: it's kind of a traction control, I think they call it. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  [ It's, + it's ] not just antilock brake.  /
sv          B.40 utt2:  I think that's already on most of them,  /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C but } --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Oh,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: this is [ a, + ] {F uh, }    

+          B.42 utt1:  -- there is a further traction control, {F uh, } /  

+          A.43 utt1:  {F Uh, } probably suspension tied into --   

aa          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- the brakes. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] also  the suspension can be raised for driving, like in the ice and  snow.  /
sd          B.46 utt2: It can raise the car's center up a little bit.    

b          A.47 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.48 utt1:  For going under --   

b         A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /

aa          A.55 utt1:  No,  /
sd          A.55 utt2: snow doesn't happen very often. /  

sv(^q)          B.56 utt1:  If it does, people go, what's this stuff. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.57 utt2: {F uh, } originally I'm from West Virginia.  /
sd          A.57 utt3: We got a --   

bk          B.58 utt1:  Oh,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: # {D well, } you had some there. # /  

+          A.59 utt1:  -- # pretty fair amount # of snow. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } I got down here in June of eighty-four,  /
sd          A.61 utt2: {C and } the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years,  /
sd          A.61 utt3: {C and } it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  We had this group of, {F uh, } surveyors come into, {F uh, } a shop I was working in, {F uh, } four or five of them, these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place.  /
sd          A.63 utt2: They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked.  /
sd          A.63 utt3: {C But, } while they were there they set back <laughter>, drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles --    

ba          B.64 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

+          A.65 utt1:  -- threw snowballs all over the place,   

x          B.66 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.67 utt1:  had themselves a ball for about an hour <laughter>. /

sv          B.68 utt2: {C and } the moon roof I think is also an option. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  Although most of them are ordered them with it,   /
sd          B.70 utt2: {C but }  there really is only about a half a dozen, {F uh, } things  /
sd          B.70 utt3: {C and } --   

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.72 utt1:  -- everything else is pretty standard.  /
sd          B.72 utt2:  I did not get the traction control which also, when you take the [ c-, + traction control ] [ and the + <breathing>, and  the ] suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too. /  

ba          A.73 utt1:  Oh,  /
%          A.73 utt2: {C so } that's kind of, -/  

sv          B.74 utt1:  You go out and get in that real cold car -- /  

bf          A.75 utt1:  # It's a package deal. # /  

sv          B.76 utt1:  -- # {C and } you turn that on,  /
%          B.76 utt2: # [ {C and }  it, + {D yeah, } {C and } it ] kind of, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.76 utt3: {C but } that's only available [ if, + with ] the traction control and the other option. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  {C And } those two are sold together  /
sd          B.78 utt2: {C so } you have to take a two thousand dollar option there [ to -- +   

ba          A.79 utt1:  Ouch. /  

+          B.80 utt1:  -- to, ] {F uh, } do it,  /
sd          B.80 utt2: {C so } [ I, + I ] opted not for that  /

ba          A.81 utt1:  No,  /

+          B.82 utt1:  {C And, } ] {F uh, } the dealership I dealt with, they order them all with the, {F uh, } moon roof and, {F uh } --   

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          A.85 utt2: I worked # for Lincoln, # /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  # {C So } the only thing # I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system  /
sd         B.86 utt2: {C and } that was pretty much it.  /
sd          B.86 utt3:  {C And } they had {D like } three or  four basic packages that [ they -- +

sv          A.89 utt1:  Sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer I used to work for.  /
