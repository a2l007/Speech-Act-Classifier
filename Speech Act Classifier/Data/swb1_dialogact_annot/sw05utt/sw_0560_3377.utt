sd          A.1 utt1:    {F Uh, } I guess I've always kind of liked golf.  /
sd          A.1 utt2: [ I, + I  ] worked on a golf course [ at, + at  ] one time  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C and } that's how I picked up golf.  /
h          A.1 utt4: {C And, } {F uh, } I don't know  /
sv          A.1 utt5: it's just [ a, + kind of a  ] challenging game. /  

aa          B.2 utt1:   It sure is.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: I play at least three times a week. /  

b          A.3 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:   I'm on it, /  

sd          A.5 utt1:   I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I'm trying to get back into it.  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {F Uh, } {C so, } {F uh, } I got to start all over again.  /
sv          A.5 utt4: It's not like riding a bicycle.  /
sv         A.5 utt5: You do tend to,   

aa          B.6 utt1:   No. /  

+          A.7 utt1:   forget. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:   {D Well, } I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers. /  

b          A.9 utt1:   <<Very faint>>  Oh.  /
b          A.9 utt2: Yeah. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:   {C And } I do enjoy playing. /  

qw          A.11 utt1:   <Throat_clearing>  What is your handicap? /  

sd          B.12 utt1:   Right now it's three. /  

bk          A.13 utt1:   Okay.  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {F Uh, } I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.  /
sd          A.13 utt3: It's probably up there to twenty now if I  ((   ))  [ to + ] start again. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:   {D Well, } if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down. /  

b          A.15 utt1:   Yeah.  /
b^r          A.15 utt2:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.15 utt3:  I have got to try and get out there.  /
sd          A.15 utt4: [ I, + I ] know with [ our, + our  ] long winters [ I, + I  ] enjoy watching it.  /
sd          A.15 utt5: I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like [ to, + to  ] see the warm weather. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:   {F Uh, } {D well, } we can usually play here year around.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play. /  

b          A.17 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:   {C But } there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and } I'm pretty much addicted to golf,  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C so. } I get out there one way or the other. /  

b          A.19 utt1:   <Throat_clearing>  Yeah,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter  /
sd          A.19 utt3: you almost have to relearn every spring <laughter> [ to, + to  ] get back out. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:   It's a good game though.  /
sv          B.20 utt2: It's very challenging  /
sd          B.20 utt3: {C and } the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself. /  

b          A.21 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:   That's the way I look at it.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  [ I, + I  ] play [ in, + in  ]  [ lo-, + a lot  ] of groups  /
sd          B.22 utt3: [ {C and } + {C but }  ] [ I, +  they ] keep score   [ and, + ] between themselves  /
sd          B.22 utt4: {C but } I really don't care.  /
sd          B.22 utt5: {F Um, } I go out  /
sd          B.22 utt6: {C and } each shot I say, {D well, } this is what I'm going to try to do -- /  

b          A.23 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:   -- {C and then } I see how close I can come to that. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:   Right.  /
aa          A.25 utt2:  Yeah,  /
bf          A.25 utt3: you always work on trying to improve each day  /
%          A.25 utt4: {C and, } -/  

b          B.26 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } [ i-, + inevitably  ] one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.  /
sd          B.26 utt3: Either I'm not driving very well  /
sd          B.26 utt4: {C or } I'm not hitting long irons very well  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C or } I'm not putting well  /
sd          B.26 utt6: [ {C or, } + {C but }  ] sometimes it all comes together. /  

aa          A.27 utt1:   Yeah.  /
aa          A.27 utt2:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.27 utt3: I know what you mean.  /
sd          A.27 utt4:  [ I, + when I  ] used to golf out there I'd putt well but [ I, + I  ] wouldn't, {F uh, } chip well.  /
sd          A.27 utt5: One of the two, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.27 utt6: {C or } something would go wrong  /
sd          A.27 utt7: {C but } I always managed [ to, +  to  ] get near par anyway. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:   {D Well, } we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst. /  

b          A.29 utt1:   Oh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:   {C And } I went to that.  /
sd          B.30 utt2:  Craig  (( Statler ))  won in a playoff. /

%          B.34 utt1:   We have a lot of, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.34 utt2: I'd say we probably have <breathing> within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } we still have the  (( Greensboro ))  Open here every year. /  

b          A.35 utt1:   Uh-huh.  /
qy          A.35 utt2:  Do you have, {F uh, } long waits, {F uh, } to get on the course? /  

ny          B.36 utt1:   Yes,  /
sd^e          B.36 utt2: we do as a matter of fact.  /
sd        B.36 utt3:  [ [ It, + it, ] + {F uh, } it's  ] only been that way in the last five years. /  

b          A.37 utt1:   Yeah. /  

%          B.38 utt1:   {C But } now you, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.38 utt2: most of the courses have a, {F uh, } two day advance tee time you have to call, /  

b          A.39 utt1:   Yeah.  /
b          A.39 utt2:  Okay.  /
