=========================================================================
  

ad          A.1 utt1:  Go ahead. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Okay,  /
o          @B.2 utt2: do I [ still  can-, + still [ can + ] ] feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world?  /
na          @B.2 utt3: Absolutely.  /
sd          @B.2 utt4:  {C And } my reasons are based upon not only [ from + ] [ what I read in the newspapers, + what I see on the newspapers,  ]  but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  {F Um. }  Okay.  /
sv          A.3 utt2:  I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,  /
sv          A.3 utt3: {C but } I think just the instability of the country right now is, # sort of scary. # /  

sv          B.4 utt1: # {D Well, } that's what # makes it a powder keg.  /
%          B.4 utt2:  The, {F um, } - /
sd          B.4 utt3: I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,   

b          A.5 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.6 utt1:  # when # my first real involvement with the military started.  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {F Um, } naturally we were at the time, - /
sd          B.6 utt3: the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.  /
sd          B.6 utt4:  {C So } we got [ lots, + quite a bit  ] of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force.  [ And + ] with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: [  These weren't, + these weren't ] Chinese made copies.  /
sd          B.8 utt3: These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty-sevens.    

b          A.9 utt1:  {F Um, } uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1:  As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.  /
sd          B.10 utt2:  In Granada, in October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.  /
sd          B.10 utt3:  Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,  /
sd          B.10 utt4: {C but } there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.  /
sd          B.10 utt5:  The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip [ of, + of ] the island down on Point Salinas.  /
sd          B.10 utt6:  {C And } for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {C And } they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  In eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.  /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C And } the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.  /
qy          B.12 utt5:  Do I consider them a threat?  /
na          B.12 utt6: Absolutely.  /
sd          B.12 utt7:  They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.  /
sd          B.12 utt8:  About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.  /
sd          B.12 utt9:  Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.  /
sd          B.12 utt10:  {C And } let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.  /
sd          B.14 utt2:  These guys are top of the line.  /
sd          B.14 utt3: [ When they, + when they ] graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.  /
sd          B.14 utt4:  {C And } they are very, very good at what they do.  /
sv          B.14 utt5: {C So } until I see the entire, quote, old guard [ of the Soviet military, + of the Soviet government ] completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider  them a threat. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist  [ gen-, + generals  ] that actually control tens and thousands of troops.  /
%          B.16 utt2:  That - /
sv          B.16 utt3: irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.17 utt2:  I guess that's what concerns me the most.   Is [ they're, + they're ] so  unstable that somebody like that could make, {F uh, } decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } it's [ in-, + interesting ] watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.  /
sd          B.20 utt2: So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.  /
sd          B.20 utt3:  There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.  /
sv          B.20 utt4:  If uprisings [ hap-, + happen ] in their sectors, [ it is, + it's ] going to be a total blood bath. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: it looks like it's come close to that as it is. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {D Actually, } they're showing remarkable restraint.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  They get real nasty, the (( hyundee ))  helicopters come out  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C and } they, would level entire areas.  /
b          B.22 utt4: Okay,  /
qy^g          B.22 utt5: you're from the Dallas area, right? /  

ny          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

bk          B.24 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy^d          B.24 utt2: {D you know, } basically the size of, {F uh, } the area around Richardson? /  

ny          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  You put five Soviet  (( hyundee ))  helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } there won't be anything left alive.  /
sd          B.26 utt3:  {C And } they can do that in about four minutes. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And } they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  They used them in Afghanistan, did [ re-, + remarkably ] well considering the terrain they were flying in.  /
sd          B.28 utt3: {C But } on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.  /
sd          B.28 utt4:  If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, [ then, + then ] the nerve gas definitely will get you.  /
sd          B.28 utt5:  The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.  /
sd          B.28 utt6:  They drink that much fuel. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.30 utt1:  Were you, - /
%          B.30 utt2: have you, - /
qy^d          B.30 utt3: I take it you haven't spent any time in the military? /  

nn          A.31 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.31 utt2: I haven't. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

qy          B.34 utt1:  # {C But, }  # during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, {E I mean, } they're getting all these weapons and stuff?  /
qy          B.34 utt2: Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff? /  

qy         A.35 utt1:  You mean [ in the, + in the ] most recent conflict? /  

sd         B.36 utt1:  In any of them since eighty-one. /  

ny          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh. }  Yeah,  /
na          A.37 utt2: definitely.  /
sd          A.37 utt3: [ [  I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq <laughter> in the past ten to fifteen years.  /
%          A.37 utt4:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.37 utt5: I think [ we, + we ] kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.  /
sv          A.37 utt6: It's bad enough that the Soviets do it. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,  /
sv          B.38 utt2: it's a matter of money,   

%          A.39 utt1:  # {F Um. }  # /  

+          B.40 utt1:  # to # a certain extent. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.43 utt2: It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons.   Especially when it's to the south of us. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Uh, } the ones to the south are more regional conflict.  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  They're not really that worried about invading north.  /
sd          B.44 utt3:  They're more interested in, - /
sd          B.44 utt4: they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that.   From Mexico all the way down into [ Cen-, + Central ] and South America.  /
sv          B.44 utt5:  The situation down there is weird  /
sv          B.44 utt6: {C and } it's very screwed up. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  Inflation is out of this world  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C and } the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.  /
 sd         B.46 utt3: {C And } generally the people,   

x          A.47 utt1:  # <Cough>.  #   

+          B.48 utt1:  # are # getting screwed,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {C and } they're tired of it,  /
sv         B.48 utt3: {C and } they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.49 utt2:  {D Well, } I think Russia is getting to the point where [ they're, + they're ] about to do something to get out of communism.  /
sd          A.49 utt3:  I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.  /
sv          A.49 utt4: I think Gorbachev has about had his day. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.  /
sv          B.50 utt2: That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing. /  

 b         A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sv         B.52 utt1:  Gorbachev has made his attempt  /
sv          B.52 utt2: {C and } he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.  /
sv          B.54 utt2:  {C So } it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,   

b          A.55 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.56 utt1:  # at # this point. /  

ba          A.57 utt1:  True <<long pause>>.  /
h          A.57 utt2: I don't know,  /
sd          A.57 utt3: I sure wouldn't turn my back on them. /  

 %         B.58 utt1:  You mean, - /
sd          B.58 utt2: I understand when [ they pulled the troops out of, + {F uh, } {E or } they reduced the number of troops in  ] Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,  /
sv          B.58 utt3: I thought that was great.  /
sd          B.58 utt4:  {C But } by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.  /
sv          B.60 utt2:  {C But } you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down.  Even if it's a regional conflict.  /
sv          B.60 utt3:  If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does [ it, + it ] [ can + ] talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.  /
sv          B.60 utt4:  It's got to have the stuff to [ back it, + back up ] what it's saying.  /
sv          B.60 utt5: If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  At least they're learning a little bit from history.   /
%          A.61 utt2: {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/
