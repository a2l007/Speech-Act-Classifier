o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
ad^t          A.1 utt2: do you want to go first? /  

sd^t          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic. /  

sd^t          A.3 utt1:  Fitness and exercise. /  

fe          @B.4 utt1:  {F Oh, } God <laughter>.  /
ar          @B.4 utt2:  No,  /
ad          @B.4 utt3: why don't you go first. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {F um, } I like to do, {F uh, } weight training [ and, + and ] cycling.  And just walking, {F uh, } swimming.  /
sd          A.5 utt3: I used to do a lot of basketball and running and  volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall.  /
sd          A.5 utt4:  {C And } the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore,  /
sd          A.5 utt5: {C so } I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit <throat_clearing>. /  

co          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } let me ask a  (( personal ))  question,  /
qw          B.6 utt2: how old are you? /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  Thirty-eight. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D well } then you should   /
sv          B.8 utt2: (( {D see } ))  over thirty-five everything goes downhill (( flop )) . /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } the rest of me is in pretty good shape  /
sd          A.9 utt2: it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {F Oh, } you're lucky then  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C because } I've battled arthritis all my life, /  

bh          A.11 utt1:  Really? /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {E I mean } even since I was {D like } about two or three. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  Then they diagnosed it,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and } usually most people are just absolutely crippled,  /
sd          B.14 utt3: {C and, }  {F uh, } I do water aerobics.    

ba          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } I bet that helps. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  Religiously do water aerobics, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  I used to do it about six times a week  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and } now I'm down to about four  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C but } it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility [ in sh-, +  in there, ]  /
sd          B.18 utt4: {F uh, } I tried weight training  /
sd          B.18 utt5: <laughter> {C and } I'm telling you, [ you just, +  I just ] can't lift the things. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {C And } the shock on the system [ is, + is ] just too much,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C so } I have stuck to water aerobics basically, {D you know, } the weightless thing and,    

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  trying to keep this shape that way  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {C but, } {D you know, } it's hard to find.  /
sd          B.22 utt3:  {E I mean } it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are, <breathing>, - /
sd          B.22 utt4: I think they feel this is going to be an effortless  (( sweatless ))  way,   

ba          A.23 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  to get in shape,   

ba          A.25 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  without having to spend anything  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C or } it's the geriatric crowd. /  

ba          A.27 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C So, }  I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. /  

sv         A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } {E I mean, } [ if, + if ] you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself,  /
sv          A.29 utt2: {C and } you probably do. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  <Breathing> Yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C but } you have to have an indoor pool. /  

ba          A.31 utt1:  This is true. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C So, }  to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, {D you know, } drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity  ((   ))  /
sd          B.32 utt2:  you look very odd in the water, /  

%          A.33 utt1:  {D Well, } that, -/  

sd          B.34 utt1:  that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training,  /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C and } that does look very odd in the water. /  

ba          A.35 utt1:  I can believe that.  /
qy          A.35 utt2:  Have you tried [ the, + {F uh, } the ] pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center? /  

nn          B.36 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.36 utt2: {C and } {D you know, } that's the only place I haven't tried  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C and } people have told me.  /
qy^d          B.36 utt4:  {D Now } that's the Texins facility? /  

ny          A.37 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  I have been told that thing is just lovely. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  It is.  /
sd          A.39 utt2:  They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Huh.  /
%          B.40 utt2:  He-, - /
qy          B.40 utt3: do you use that facility a lot? /  

na          A.41 utt1:  {F Um, } [ a fairly, + a fairly ] good amount, {F uh, } more on the weekends,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {F uh, } I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Huh.  /
qy          B.42 utt2:  Do you know if they have child care there? /  

qy          A.43 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Um, } have you done your attitude survey for this year yet? /  

x          B.44 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

ad          A.45 utt1:  You need to put that on there, seriously. /  

%          B.46 utt1:  They don't, - /
sd          B.46 utt2: [ I don't, + I don't ] work at T I. /  

bh          A.47 utt1:  {F Oh, } you don't? /  

nn          B.48 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.48 utt2: I used to work at T I, /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {D actually } when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry <breathing>,  /
sd          B.50 utt3: {C and } I used to fill out those attitude surveys, /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } me and the insurance adjusters [ are, + are ] very familiar with each other  /
sd          B.52 utt2: {C and } my husband still works there, /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

x           B.54 utt1: /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C and, }  {F um, } I get my attitude expressed through them,  /
sd          B.54 utt3: {C but } I find it to be very - /
sd          B.54 utt4: sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot [ short-, + ]  ((   ))  mentality to save a few bucks. /  

ba          A.55 utt1:  This is true. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  <Breathing> {F Uh, } {C and } never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C and } I came down here  /
sd          B.56 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } they did an attitude survey like  six weeks after I had been working here  /
sd          B.56 utt4: {C and } I asked about, {D you know, } day care for the shift workers, /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C and } {D boy } I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, {D you know, } /  

%          A.59 utt1:  {D Well, } it's not, -/  

sd          B.60 utt1:  it was not applicable to me  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C and } I was kind of horrified. /  

qw          A.61 utt1:  {D Now } what year are we talking about? /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  We're talking nineteen seventy-eight. /  

bk          A.63 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: {F uh, } things have become much more enlightened since then. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages <laughter>. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.65 utt2: {D you know, } we still don't have a day care facility  /
sd          A.65 utt3: {C but } people are more sympathetic to it. /  

sd          B.66 utt1: [ I understand, + I understand ] that they're now covering women's preventative health care, /  

aa          A.67 utt1:  Yes.  /
aa^r          A.67 utt2: Yes. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {C and, }  {F uh, } the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back [ and + ] {A I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. }  {F Um, } I had been rated number one in the field  /
%          B.68 utt2: {C and then } I took, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.68 utt3: when I became pregnant I also got meningitis,   

b          A.69 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  and then delivered the first baby three months early, /  

ba          A.71 utt1:  My gosh. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  {C and } they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home,  /
sd          B.72 utt2: {C and } the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment. /  

ad^c          A.73 utt1:  Could you hold the phone for one second, /  

aa          B.74 utt1:  Sure. /  

fa          A.75 utt1:  Thanks.  /
o          A.75 utt2: <<Pause>> Okay,  /
sd          A.75 utt3: I'm back. /  

%          B.76 utt1:  {C And then } they used to, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.76 utt2: {C and then } I had a second one eighteen months later,  /
sd          B.76 utt3: they told me to put them back to back  /
%          B.76 utt4: {C and, }  of course, to maintain - /
sd          B.76 utt5: {C and } I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one,    

ba          A.77 utt1:  Wow. /  

+          B.78 utt1:  because that's when I go into labor  ((   ))  four and a half months  /
sd          B.78 utt2: {C and } I don't even know it. /  

sv          A.79 utt1:  Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back. /  

aa          B.80 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
aa          B.80 utt2: very easy,  /
aa^r          B.80 utt3: very easy  /
sd          B.80 utt4: {C and } [ they, + they ] put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then [ to, + to ] try to control the labor and see how far it was going,  /
sd          B.80 utt5: {C and } after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor.  /
sd          B.80 utt6:  I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof,   

b          A.81 utt1:  Really. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  because it was a, {F uh, } thirteen thousand dollar bill,  /
sd          B.82 utt2: <breathing> {C but } after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work, /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.84 utt1:  {C and } that was when they had, - /
sd          B.84 utt2: God it would have been the eighty-five layoff, /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  <Breathing> {C and } I'll tell you how they handled this  /
sd          B.86 utt2: {C and } I was just outraged,  /
sd          B.86 utt3: I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, {F uh, } terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later  /
sd          B.86 utt4: {C and } they didn't have any coverage under my name  /
sd          B.86 utt5: {C and } I went back  /
sd          B.86 utt6: {C and } I said what the hell is going on here, {D you know. } /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.87 utt2: really. /  

sd(^q)          B.88 utt1:  {C And } they told me [ that, + ] {F uh, } {F oh, }  {D well, } {D you know, } {D you know, } your husband works here  /
^q          B.88 utt2: {C and } he's got a good salary  /
^q         B.88 utt3: we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway,  /
^q          B.88 utt4: {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } we've got people here that really, {D you know, } need to be working  /
%          B.88 utt5: {C and } so that we had just, - /
sd          B.88 utt6: {D you know, } it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person  /
^q          B.88 utt7: {C and } we'd just let you go.  /
sd          B.88 utt8:  {C And } it took me about a year of arguing,  /
sd(^q)          B.88 utt9: I said, {D you know, } I've got to put this in writing to me,    

b          A.89 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.90 utt1:  [ and + ] because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits  /
sd          B.90 utt2: {C and } I couldn't get my, {F uh, } termination benefits either. /  

ba          A.91 utt1:  There you go. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. /  

sd          A.93 utt1: [ I, + I ] can believe that. /  

sd          B.94 utt1:  <Noise> {C But } [ I, + I ] guess things have gotten better,  /
sd          B.94 utt2: I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of  (( things )) , -/  

ba          A.95 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sv          A.95 utt2: flex time is great. /
