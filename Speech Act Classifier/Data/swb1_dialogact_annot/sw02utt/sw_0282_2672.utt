ad          A.1 utt1:  Start. /  

qw          @B.2 utt1:  What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett? /  

%          A.3 utt1:  {F Um, } th-, - /
sd          A.3 utt2: {D well } right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C and } they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, {F um, } plastic, {F um, }  I think three bins for glass, white, green, and [ whatev-, + whatever ] other combination there is. /  

x          B.4 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.5 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I think they've got [ a comp-, + ] {F uh, } some kind of container for aluminum. /  

 sd         B.6 utt1:  Plano's doing real good on that.  /
sd         B.6 utt2: [ They have, + {F uh, } they ] start off putting out great big huge garbage cans.    

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.8 utt1:  Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C and } of course it doesn't fit right now. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C But } now we start in May, breaking it down,  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C and } they're picking it all up. /  

%          A.11 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.12 utt1: {C So } they're going to by, - /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C and } we have to separate our papers, and our glass,  /
sd          B.12 utt3: {C and then, } {F uh, } they have one day for, {D like, } {F um, } {F oh, } everything you picked up from your yard, /  

b          A.13 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  # {C and } # we put that in disposable bags,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and }  they pick that up on Monday. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C So } it's really great.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: [ I, + I'm ] [ really going  head, + {D you know, } completely for it,  ]  /
sd          B.16 utt3: I think it's marvelous. /  

ba          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } that's good.  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {D Well, } Rowlett had [ sent, + sent ] out a survey, not too long ago, {F um, } in terms in how many people were interested in having [ a, + a ] pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  {C And } apparently a lot of people responded to it [ favorl-, + favorably, ] because they're going to do it.  /
sd          A.17 utt4: I don't know [ how, + how ] soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,   /
sd          A.17 utt5: {C but } [ they're, + they're ] supposed to initiate that [ some-, + sometime ] in the next couple of months. /  

qy          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } does your, {F uh, } - /
qy          B.18 utt2: where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that? /  

no          A.19 utt1:  {F Um, } I've never noticed that.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  We don't have [ a, + a ] whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C so } most of the things we have are through our cafeteria.  {F Um, } /  

qy          B.20 utt1:  {D Well, } down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, {D you know, } pop cans, and things like that? /  

nn          A.21 utt1:  {F Um, } no.  /
sd^e          A.21 utt2: [  There's, + there's ] only one pop machine  /
sd          A.21 utt3: {C and } it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,  /
sd          A.21 utt4: {C so, }  {F uh, } mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea. /  

bf          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter>  {C So } you don't have much choice there. /  

aa          A.23 utt1:  No <laughter>.  /
sd          A.23 utt2: [  Not, + not ] really. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {D Well } I work at, {F uh, } J C Penny  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C and } last week they brought, - /
sd          B.24 utt3: they have a sign up that says for one full week --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  -- you bring in your old wire hangers  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } they're going to recycle them. /  

%          A.27 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C So } it's getting people clean out their closets and such. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And then } {D like, }   the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C and } they brought it down to the shelters.  /
sd          B.30 utt3:  {C And, }  they  have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- for cans for people have pop,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: {C and } they put them right near where they have the time cards. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {C And } it works great.  /
sd          B.34 utt2:  {C And } they have one in the room where the <clicking> snack machines are too. /  

ba          A.35 utt1:  That's good. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C So } they're really going at it,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C and } I think it's marvelous because, -/  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.37 utt2: [  I, + I ] guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is. /  

%          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } -/  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C And } I think they're trying [ to, + to ] make some changes.  /
sd          A.39 utt2: [  I, + I ] noticed at the library or someplace this past, {F uh, } month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, {F um, } talk about doing lawn work and, [ h-, + how ] important it is [ to, + to ] cut your lawn without a bag.  Just to kind of mulch it,   

 b         B.40 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          A.41 utt1:  # rather # than bag it up, because of [ a-, + all ] [ the + the  ] grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C and } it's, {F uh, } I guess a lot more [ e-, + ecological ] to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil. /  

qy          B.42 utt1:  {D Well, } did you watch the program the other night on, {F um, } was it SAVE AMERICA? /  

 na         A.43 utt1:  I saw part of that. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  It was good.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: The only thing I [ g-, + ] thought, {F um, } that I haven't been trying, is when I, {D you know, } go to take a shower, to save the water,   

b          A.45 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.46 utt1:  # and # to put it on my plants.  Which I had never thought about before. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {C But } I've already gone to, - /
sd          B.48 utt2: {F oh } I started years ago, I guess, not years ago, - /
%          B.48 utt3:  {C but, }  yeah  /
sd          B.48 utt4: I would say five years ago, turning off [ my fountain, + {E I mean } my water ] faucet,    

b          A.49 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.50 utt1:  # in # the sink when I brush my teeth.  /
sd          B.50 utt2:  {C But } I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  # That # was surprising to me. /  

%          A.53 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  I missed that question, totally, {E I mean } really bad.  /
sd          B.54 utt2:  I'm trying to think,  /
sd          B.54 utt3: I didn't miss too many,  /
sd          B.54 utt4: I can't remember what my score was,  /
sd          B.54 utt5: {C but } I did exceeding well.  /
sd          B.54 utt6: I was surprised.  /
sd          B.54 utt7:  {C But } I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.  /
sd          B.54 utt8: That was a shocker to me. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {D well } there are a lot of things that aren't,  /
%          A.55 utt3:  (( I'm )) , - /
sd          A.55 utt4: that's, {F uh, } one of the things I wonder about,  /
sd^t          A.55 utt5: {F uh, } one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.  /
sd          A.55 utt6: [  I, + I ] wonder about some of the  [ prod-, + products  ] that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take.  {F Uh, } [ why, + why  ] they couldn't do more recycling with those. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {D Well, } I was in, {F uh, } Bizmart the other day,  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C and, }  what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,  /
sd          B.56 utt3: {C and } it cost more than regular paper. /  

%          A.57 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C And } it was only, I think, {F uh, } forty cents more, {D you know, } fifty cents more,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {C but, }   

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  It upset me to realize [ that, hey, the recycling + that they're going through the expense of recycling,  ]  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C but } people aren't buying it,  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C so } the cost of it is higher. /  

ba          A.61 utt1:  True.  /
b          A.61 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.61 utt3: I noticed that about things like - /
sd          A.61 utt4: [ I s-, + I seen  ] a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers [ and, + and ] lawn additives and that type of thing,  /
sd          A.61 utt5: {C but } the cost [ is, + is ] {D like, }  double or sometimes triple,   

b          B.62 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          A.63 utt1:  # [ what + ] # the regular [ things you, +  fertilizers and things you ] buy.  /
%          A.63 utt2:  {C So, }  in, in terms of that, - /
%          A.63 utt3: it's, - /
sv          A.63 utt4: {D you know, } {C and, }  for the environment [ [ it's, + it's, ] + there's ] a good reason to do it,  /
sv          A.63 utt5: {C but } the cost is kind of prohibitive. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {D Now, } {D see } that's recycling, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.64 utt2: companies that do at least go into it,  /
sd          B.64 utt3: I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or  something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {C So } that people would use this stuff [ re-, + ] over again. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.67 utt2: it's a good idea. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  It's like when he was saying, {F uh, } which one was recyclable, which was reusable, /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  {C and } the recycle ones are better to use,  /
sd          B.70 utt2: {C  but } lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.71 utt2: true. /  

sv          B.72 utt1:  {C And } if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.  /
sd          B.72 utt2:  I had to put my bifocals on to see it <laughter>. /  

%          A.73 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sv         B.76 utt1:  <Laughter> You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.  /
sv(^q)          B.76 utt2: You haven't got enough nerve to say {D well, } put it back,  /
^q          B.76 utt3: it's not recyclable. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  [ I, + I'd ] heard something stranger,  /
sd          A.77 utt2: talk about bottles the other day  [ on, {F uh, } + on  ] the radio station, {A I think it's K L T Y. }  They were talking about the, - /
sd          A.77 utt3: I think it's in Canada they're using, {F oh, } recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs,   

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.79 utt1:  as [ a, + a ] reinforcement for roads.    

bh          B.80 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

+          A.81 utt1:  For road repairs.  /
sd          A.81 utt2: {C And } apparently [ they, + they ] don't break down very easily,  /
sd          A.81 utt3: {C and, }   

b          B.82 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.83 utt1:  they don't expand [ or, + or ] contract when the weather changes,  /
sd          A.83 utt2: {C and } <laughter> this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing. /  

%          B.84 utt1:  {D You know } they're, - /
sd          B.84 utt2: along that same line,  they said they were using, {F um, } - /
^h          B.84 utt3:  what is, oh, I know, - /
sd          B.84 utt4: it was toilets.   {A You know, the old ones? }    

b          A.85 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.86 utt1:  Smashing them up, because [ they're, + ] that stuff there is great [ for, + in  ] road work. /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          B.88 utt1:  {C And } I thought, {D well, } that's good.  /
sd          B.88 utt2:  {C And then } I saw recycling on tires between, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.88 utt3: {D well, } hoses were being used,    

b          A.89 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.90 utt1:  # {C and, }  # {F uh, } {F uh, } soaker hoses, made out of old tires. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.92 utt1:  What else, - /
^h          B.92 utt2: something else was made out of old tires,  /
^h          B.92 utt3: I was trying to remember what it was.  {F Oh, } I can't think of it now.  /
sd          B.92 utt4: {C But } [ I was, + I was ] trying to  get my, {F uh, } kids, {D you know, } to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes. /  

b          A.93 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.94 utt1:  {C And } just anything, to, {D you know, } recycle rather than keep throwing it away,  /
sd          B.94 utt2: {C but } my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,  /
sd          B.94 utt3: {C and then } I forget to bring them in the store. /  

b          A.95 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.96 utt1:  I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and  take my garbage back out.  /
sd          B.96 utt2:  I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because [ I never realized, + I really didn't realize ] how much stuff I actually throw away. /  

sv          A.97 utt1:  {D Well, } I think [ the, + the ] more people are aware of it, [ the, + the ] more they'll do.  /
sv          A.97 utt2:  I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it [ in, + in ] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that. /  

sd          B.98 utt1:  {D You know } what I'd like to see a little more. - /
sd          B.98 utt2: I don't have any little tiny kids, /  

b          A.99 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.100 utt1:  {C but } if  they get the little tiny kids saving it now,   

b          A.101 utt1:  Yeah. /
