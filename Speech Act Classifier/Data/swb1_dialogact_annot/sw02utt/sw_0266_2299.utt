sd          B.24 utt3: {C but, }  {D you know, } sometimes it's just so, - /
sd          B.24 utt4: seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  -- them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them. /
