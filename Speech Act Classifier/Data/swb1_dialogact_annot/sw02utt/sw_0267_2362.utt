b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } my reason for that was I don't like [ the, + {F uh, } {A what's the right word. } The ] varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools. /

sd          B.64 utt3: I was eighth and  ninth graders that I worked with  /
sd          B.64 utt4: {C and } if we did have [ a, + a ] student come in and  they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {C And } you don't know if you were reaching them or not  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C but } we felt like, {D you know, } maybe just going ahead and [ try to teaching them was bet-, + trying to teach them was better ] than have them taken out. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.67 utt2: Because, {F uh, } {F uh, } that just, - /

sv          B.72 utt1: I think there's a problem too with teachers trying [ to, + {F um, } <<pause>> to ] be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.72 utt2: they've been a big drive [ in, + especially in  ] the seventies to return back to the basics. /

b          A.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.84 utt1:  {C And then } at the end [  of the, + of a ] certain time period you spitted everything back out  /
sd          B.84 utt2: {C and } the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Yeah. /
