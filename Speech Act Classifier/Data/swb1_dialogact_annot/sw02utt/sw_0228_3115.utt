 +         B.36 utt1:  -- spirit week.  /
sd          B.36 utt2:  {C And } one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some --   

qy^g          A.37 utt1:  {C And } you never know that, though --

+          A.39 utt1:  -- sometimes when you're going in, do you? /  

nn          B.40 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.40 utt2: {C but } because I sort of stick to several schools, {F uh, } I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on [ and, + and ] might, might remember to do it. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.41 utt2: right. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {C And then } many schools on a particular day during, {F uh, } I guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, {F uh, } game day --   

b          A.43 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  -- which, -/

b          B.46 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: it might be Thursday for the high schools  /

b          A.47 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.47 utt2: right.  /
sd          A.47 utt3:  {C So } that would kind of give you [ a, + a ] clue, I guess  /
sd          A.47 utt4: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] sometimes you get the long term stuff  /
sd          A.47 utt5: {C so } you're aware ahead of time --

sd          A.49 utt5: [ I, + I ] think about, {D well, } the dress code they have for the kids, {D you know. }  /
%          A.49 utt6:  Are - /
sd          A.49 utt7: they   put one on the parents, or the teachers and say [ they have to, + the men have to ] wear ties  /
sd          A.49 utt8: {C and } there can be no blue jeans worn  /
sd          A.49 utt9: {C and, }  because some of the teachers I know wear, {F uh, } dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease  /

sd          A.51 utt3:  [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I don't know that that looks that bad.  /
sv          A.51 utt4:  {C But, }  if you're going to tell the kids they [ c-, + ] have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.52 utt2: [ it, + it, ] - /
sd          B.52 utt3: I see that the, - /
sv          B.52 utt4: I think the elementary school teachers, or  maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier [ than, + than ] some of the high school teachers, I think. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But } [ it, + I think it  ] varies,  [ [ it, + it ] + ] just so much.  /
sd          B.54 utt2: [ Anything, + anything ] can go. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {C And } you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like  history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.  /
sd          B.56 utt2:  {C But } they're just sort of into clothes,  /
sd          B.56 utt3: {C and then } there's other departments --
