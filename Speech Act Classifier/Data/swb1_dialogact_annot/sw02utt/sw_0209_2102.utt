o          A.1 utt1: Okay,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: {D well, } my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C And } I would (( )) it like that, - /
sd          A.1 utt4: [ I, + I ] like the adventure of it.   

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh <throat_clearing>. /  

+          A.3 utt1: And the idea [ that, + that ] we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space. /  

b^r          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.5 utt1: {C And then } I {D like } the, - /
sd          A.5 utt2: they have a new one now.  /
sd          A.5 utt3: The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION.   

b          B.6 utt1:  Right <throat_clearing>. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  Which it's an all new cast,  but kind of the same idea,  going out to new places [ and, + and ] doing new things and finding out about different people,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C and } [ I've, + I've ] always liked that show probably the very best. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS, one way or  another over the years.   {F Uh, } although I never watched it regularly.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:  I'm certainly acquainted with [ the character -- +   

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1:  -- the characters. ]  /
sd          B.10 utt2:  {C And then } I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.11 utt2: those, - /
sv          A.11 utt3: the movies are good too. /  

x          B.12 utt1:  <Cough>.   

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C And } [ I, + I ] guess [ all, + most ] of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure  <laughter>. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  [ When I, + when I ] started thinking about this, [ that + ] those are some of my favorite shows, MCGYVER, because [ it's, + it's ] only one person there, [ more than, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } instead of a cast --   

b^r          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+         A.17 utt1:  -- of people,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C but } he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, {D you know, } pieces of baling wire [ and, + and ]  a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider  /
%          A.17 utt3: {C and } <laughter>, -/  

sd          B.18 utt1:  I don't think [ I, + I've ] even heard of that show. /  

qy^d          A.19 utt1:  You haven't? /  

qy^d          B.20 utt1:  It's called MCGYVER? /  

ny          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qw          B.22 utt1:  {C And } [ what is, + what is ] he? /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  He's like a semigovernment type agent.  Who [ goes out then to, + {F uh, } works for ] the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ h-, + his ] big thing is that he can take [ pieces of, + little bits ] and  pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder. /  

b^r          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  <Laughter>  {C So } [ he, + he ] does all kinds of strange things like that. /  

ba          B.28 utt1:  {F Oh, } great.  /
sv          B.28 utt2:  Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard,   

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it. /  

bf          A.31 utt1:  <Laughter> See what we can come up with.  /
qy          A.31 utt2:  Do you like the, {F uh, } news shows, TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things? /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: [ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I used to like the show very much. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C But, }  unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out [ some, + some ] of the baby,   

^2          A.35 utt1:  Some of the --   

+          B.36 utt1:  with the bath water. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- little things,  /
aa          A.37 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C And } {F uh, } I just decided I had to do that.   I think, in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {E I mean } I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours. /  

%          A.39 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {C And } I just realized, I was sort of like an alcoholic,  /
sv          B.40 utt2: if I didn't get the booze out of the house, I was going to drink. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Oh. /  

%          B.42 utt1:  {D So. } -/  

sd          A.43 utt1:  I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that.  /
sd          A.43 utt2: [ I have more or less, + I have my favorite shows ]  /
sd          A.43 utt3: {C and } I usually make time in my day or my week, {D you know, } to watch those. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  {C But, }  for the most part, [ I try, + I have small kids and I try ] and keep it on just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.46 utt2: yeah. <<Clears throat>> /  

%          A.47 utt1:  {C Because } they're, - /
%          A.47 utt2: I guess [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] falls  ((   )) , - /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C and } one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids.  /
sd          A.47 utt4:  I like that real well. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {D well, } when my kids were little, I did have a T V set  /
sd          B.48 utt3: {C and } I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  I don't think they have that on anymore. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {D Well } that would be a shame. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time.  /
sd          A.51 utt2: [ I, + I ] remember it when I was younger [ of, + ] {D you know, } catching it on P B S,  /
sd          A.51 utt3: {C but, }  {F uh, } I don't think they show, - /

sv          A.51 utt5: maybe it's in, - /
sd          A.51 utt6: if it was in repeats, - /

sd          A.53 utt1:  I haven't seen it in a long time.  /
sv          A.53 utt2:  {C But } SESAME STREET is still really good. /

%          A.57 utt2:  I, - /
sd          A.57 utt3: that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on <laughter>. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  SESAME STREET comes on from {D like } nine to ten, which is a good time  /
sv          A.59 utt2: {C and } everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go,  /
%          A.59 utt3: {C so }  it's - /
