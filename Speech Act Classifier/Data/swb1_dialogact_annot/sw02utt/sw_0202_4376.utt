===========================================================================
  

ad          A.1 utt1:  <Talking> <noise> Your turn. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2:  {F Uh, } I don't think they should abolish it <laughter>.  /
sv          @B.2 utt3: [ I think, + I think ] if they put it into force more often, they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got. /  

qy^d          A.3 utt1:  {C But } not for petty theft? /  

na          B.4 utt1:  Right.  /
nn          B.4 utt2:  No,  /
nn^r          B.4 utt3: no.  /
sv          B.4 utt4:  For major things like premeditated murder.  Mass murders. {F Uh, } {D you know, } that type of thing.  /
sv          B.4 utt5:  I don't think it should just be used loosely. /  

qy          A.5 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>  {D Well, } it should be used as a deterrent do you think? /  

nd          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } -/  

qrr          A.7 utt1:  {C Or } should it be used, {F uh, }  /
qy@          A.7 utt2: [ a-, + ] to prevent further, # {F uh, } crime? #   

ny          B.8 utt1:  # Yes,  /
ny^r          B.8 utt2: yes.  /
sv          B.8 utt3:  To # prevent these people from ever getting out on the street.    

+@          A.9 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

+          B.10 utt1:  By, {D you know, } some technicality.  /
sv          B.10 utt2:  {C And } they go down the line ten years  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {C and  then } on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.12 utt1: {C And, } {D you know, } that's about the only thing.  /
sv          B.12 utt2: Like [ for petty, + for theft ] [ and, + and ] stuff like that or manslaughter, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.12 utt3:  I don't # think they should do that. # /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  # {D Well, } {D you know, } # there's this old, {F uh, } Jewish, {A is it, } saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } # {D well, } I guess, #   

x          A.15 utt1:  # <Throat_clearing>. #   

+           B.16 utt1: [ if I, + if it ] was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {D You know, } I've never had anybody in my immediate family, {F uh, } murdered  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C and so } I really wouldn't know.  /
sd          B.16 utt4:  [ {C But, } + {C but } ] I feel {D like } if I did, I probably would feel that way. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } one of the things I was thinking about <whistling> is, {F uh, } {D you know, } from society's point of view, if you put a value on each person, what you want to do is to maximize the end game value.  /
sv          A.17 utt2:  {C So } if you have someone [ that, + that ] destroys that value --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- {F uh, } then [ what + ] you want to take steps to, {F uh, } minimize the loss.  /
sv          A.19 utt2:  Of course, you have to also put value on the criminal. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C So } if you terminate him, that's a loss of value. /  

ba          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } that's true <<very faint>>. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {C So, } {D you know, } if you weight everyone equally, then you have to say, {D well } the likelihood of not terminating him, - /
sv          A.23 utt2: if you don't terminate him, the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person.  /
sv          A.23 utt3:  In other words, [ you'd have to, + you'd have to ] murder more than one other person --   

^2          B.24 utt1:  Besides him. /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- {F uh, } in order to justify taking his life. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:  <Lipsmack> Another way you could do it is weight this value by, {F uh, } the value to society of the people.   {F Uh, } which is pretty delicate thing to do.  /
sv          A.27 utt2: {C But } one way of doing it is, {F uh, } by income.  /
sv          A.27 utt3:  {C So } <laughter> if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money,   

x          B.28 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.29 utt1:  which is often times the case, # [ then # -- +   

^2          B.30 utt1:  # His life # isn't worth very much then <laughter>. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- then ] he's obviously not worth very much  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C and so, } {F uh, } the likelihood that, {D you know, } maybe [ expected, + expected ] murders by him [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } integrated over the income of the people, {F uh, } that he murders is maybe, {D you know, } a loss of, <lipsmack> who knows, eight hundred thousand dollars.  /
sv          A.31 utt3:  {F Uh, } {C but } if he only, {F uh, } [ integrated, + {D you know, } integrated ] income over the expected remainder of his life of is, {F uh, } <lipsmack> small, less than eight hundred thousand dollars, then you terminate him <inhaling>.  /
 sv         A.31 utt4:  Of course, one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm, is you find that [ it's more easy, + it's easier  [ to, + {F uh, } to,  ] ] {F uh, } terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less.    

b          B.32 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  Which means, {D well } - /
sv          A.33 utt2: I suppose you could say, {D well } that has something to do with potential <ringing> for rehabilitation. /  

b^m          B.34 utt1:  Potential.  /
sv          B.34 utt2:  {E I mean } [ that's, + that's ] the key right there.   Potential. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  # {D Now, } # [ are they, + are they ] rehabilitative [ or, + or ] not. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  {D Now } that's all fine and well [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } good philosophical.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  {C But } if you're involved yourself, personally -- -/  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- {F uh, } I know I have a friend whose, {F uh, } son was murdered, {F uh, } on the night before his sixteenth birthday.  /
sd          A.39 utt2: {C And } let me tell you, {F uh, } [ I, + I ] knew them personally, {F uh, } not intimately, but quite well  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {C and, }  {F uh, } <inhaling> you're talking about real trauma.   {E I mean } trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies. /  

ba          B.40 utt1:  I can imagine. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  The father, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.41 utt2: of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get, I think, in terms of psychological impact. /  

ba          B.42 utt1:  Yes. /  

%          A.43 utt1:  {F Uh, } # {C and, }  # -/  

qy          B.44 utt1:  # Was he # murdered?  /
qy          B.44 utt2: Did they find who killed him? /  

ny          A.45 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes.  /
sd^e          A.45 utt2:  They found him  /
sd          A.45 utt3: {C and } he is on trial for capital murder. /  

qy^d          B.46 utt1: {C So }  it hasn't been a long time ago.  /
qy^d          B.46 utt2: # Just recently. # /  

ng          A.47 utt1: # {F Uh, } {D well, } # {D actually } [ he has, + {E [ I, + I'm ] sorry. }  He was  ] convicted, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {C and, } of course, now, {D you know, } [ and + ] you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process  /
 %         A.47 utt3: {C but } <beep>, -/  

b          B.48 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
b^r          B.48 utt2: yeah.  /
sv          B.48 utt3:  That appeals process, {E I mean, } it's what, {D you know, } really, {D you know, } just drags out and out and out.  /
 sd         B.48 utt4:  My brother-in-law here in Texas, [ his, by marriage, + my sister's,  ] {F uh, } husband, his sister was murdered down here by a guy [ [ in, + in, ] + {D well } {D actually } in ] Houston  /
%          B.48 utt5: {C and, }  {F uh, } he, -/
