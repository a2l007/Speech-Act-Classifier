qo          @A.1 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ what i-, + what is ] your practice as far as budgeting?  /
qy          @A.1 utt2:  Do you manage the money? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, + we ] talk about it,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C but } I'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper [ and, + and ] tries to somehow make the ends meet,  which, {F uh, } -/  

bk          A.3 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  That's how kind of I am, too.  /
qy          A.3 utt3: Are you married? /  

ny          B.4 utt1:  {F Um, } yes. /  

bf          A.5 utt1:  You are. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  I think the women for the most part end up managing the money.  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  My husband always says he earns it, and I have to spend only what he earns <laughter>.  /
%          A.7 utt3: It, -/  

sd          B.8 utt1:  <Laughter> I don't mind the spending,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: it's just that [ trying to, + trying to ] get what you need [ out of, + out of ] what you have.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:  That seems to be our challenge. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't work outside of the home,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and } he always threatens that when I spend more than,   

x          B.10 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.11 utt1:  what's coming in, I have to go back to work -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:  I see. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  -- {C so } [ I, + I ] manage it <laughter>. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] at home also,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C so, }  it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary, {F uh, } /  

qy          A.15 utt1:  {D Now, } do you actually follow a budget? /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {D Well, } we <breathing> pretty well do.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {F Um, } several years we didn't,  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C and } we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had,  /
sd          B.16 utt4: {C and so } [ we, + we, ] {F um, } set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.16 utt5: just our bills.  /
sd          B.16 utt6: {C And then } what's left we divvy up.  /
 sd         B.16 utt7:  We try to save a little bit, although we're not always successful,  /
sd          B.16 utt8: {C and then } the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } that's pretty much the way [ we do, + {F um, } {E or } we did ] in the past,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: I would say.  {F Uh, } - /
sd          A.17 utt3: at this point our children are grown,  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C and so } I really don't have the obligations there any more --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- that we have to balance to --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  -- {D you know, } get things together for them,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C and } I really just keep very good records,  /
sd          A.21 utt3: {C and } most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that,  /
sd          A.21 utt4: {C and } --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  -- {F uh, } I don't always succeed at that.  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  I usually keep one with a low interest rate,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C and } I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to <laughter> -- /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  -- {C and then } I have another one,  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C but } for the most part, our mortgage and our utilities at this point, {A we're in a new home,  and, } {F uh, } they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to -- /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sd         A.29 utt1:  -- {C so } I'm still getting used to that,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C but } we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead -- /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  -- {C and } we do not buy us, new cars.  /
qy          A.31 utt2:  {F Uh, } do you get into car, -/  

na          B.32 utt1:  {D Well, } we had new cars, {F um, } always until about four years ago,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: my husband, {F um, } owned his own company and it went under,  /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C and so } we could no longer afford that monthly payment,  /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C and } now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend [ that, + that ] we do have a used car,  /
sd          B.32 utt5: {D well, } he has a company car also,  /
sd          B.32 utt6: {C but } for our personal car we have a used car.  /
qy          B.32 utt7:  {F Um, } do you think that it's wiser to buy used? /  

na          A.33 utt1:  We do for us very much so.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:   In fact, we are in a position that most of our friends [ why, +  wonder why ] we just don't go to a new car, {D you know, } whatever,  /
sd          A.33 utt3: {C and } I said --   

b          B.34 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- look, you guys are all into car payments,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: we haven't had car payments for so many years,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: I love it this way,  /
sd          A.35 utt4: {C and } recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked  /
sd          A.35 utt5: {C and } it has eighty-two thousand miles on it -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd(^q)         A.37 utt1:  -- {C and } we [ were, + ] kept saying, wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it. /  

x          B.38 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.39 utt1:  Believe it or not, we did, we found one, one newer -- /  

ba          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } no, /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  -- the worst part is, it's the same color -- /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd(^q)          A.43 utt1:  -- {C and so } everybody's saying, you're kidding,   

x          B.44 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.45 utt1:  you have two cars the same,  /
sd          A.45 utt2: {C and } I said, you know how when you have a bad one, you say, never again <laughter> -- /  

ba          B.46 utt1:  That's right <laughter>. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  -- I said, {D well, } we had one, and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it -- /  

ba          B.48 utt1:  Wow. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  -- {C and } it's an eighty-five,  /
sd(^q)          A.49 utt2: {C and so } I said, Hey, this was a cinch,  /
sd          A.49 utt3: we paid for the car,  /
sd          A.49 utt4: {C and } we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  This is for all the long running back and forth on, {D you know } interstate driving and things,  /
sd          A.51 utt2: {C and } we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably. /  

qr          B.52 utt1:  Do you, {F um, } buy from dealers or from individuals? /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  Generally from dealers,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C and } {F uh, } it depends, because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual --   

b          B.54 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.55 utt1:  -- {F uh, } unless [ we, + we ] have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell -- /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  -- {D you know, } we were going up to a larger one,  /
sd          A.57 utt2: {C but } we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer, [ and + ] we always make a deal.  /
sd(^q)          A.57 utt3:  I mean, we have walked out of more dealerships saying, don't bring us the manager, and  all of that unless you want to bring him right away.  /
^q          A.57 utt4:  You're going to get one shot at us -- /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.59 utt1:  -- we will, <laughter> {D you know, } - /
sd(^q)          A.59 utt2: {C and } they say, {D Well, } you're kidding, {D you know. }  /
%          A.59 utt3: I s-, - /
^q          A.59 utt4: no, /  

x          B.60 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

^q          A.61 utt1:  this is the price we're going to give you out the door.  /
^q          A.61 utt2:  We don't want to hear about taxes, /
