qo          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } how did it go? /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {D Well, } it went pretty well, {F uh, } other than the fact that we encountered some, {F uh, } problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C and } eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain.

sd          B.30 utt1:  [ Fortunately, + I was very fortunate,  ] {F uh, } in the fact that, {F uh, } when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up  and we # turned the water on # --

sd          A.47 utt1:  It was a latex [ paint, + paint, ]  /
