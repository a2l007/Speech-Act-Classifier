sd          A.1 utt1:   <beep> {D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't think that [ it's, + it's ] wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.  /
sd          A.1 utt2: For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that [ where there's, + where there's, ] {F uh, } endangerment to their own life and other people's lives. /  

aa          B.2 utt1:   {F Uh, } I agree with that.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:  People that are, {F uh, } driving --   

b          A.3 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:   -- like, {F uh, } truck driver's and things like that.  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  I definitely think they should be tested.  /
sd          B.4 utt3:  {C And } [ I'm not, + I'm not ] opposed to any testing.  /
sd          B.4 utt4:  {E I mean } because I know I certainly wouldn't want [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me [ or, + or ] {D you know, } because he was on drugs while he was there. /  

b          A.5 utt1:   Yeah. /  

  %        B.6 utt1:   <lipsmack> {F Uh } ... /  

qo          A.7 utt1:   {D Well, } [ how do you, + how do you ] feel about, {F uh, } companies drug testing prior to hiring? /  

sd          B.8 utt1:   {F Oh, } {F uh, } I was tested, {F uh, } within my company.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  I think it's kind of a push to, {F uh, } weed out drugs in states  /
sd          B.8 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C because } ] I don't know of any other countries that are doing this -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:   -- {C and } [ I, + I ] feel like it's really just within the United States.  /
sd          B.10 utt2: [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] okay.  /
sd          B.10 utt3: I think your record should stand for itself.  That, {D you know, } if you've been tested at other companies {C and } you've always come up negative {C or } whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense --   

b          A.11 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:   -- of testing you over and over and over.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  {C And } once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not.  I think they could, {F uh, } save money by not doing that.  {D You know, }  every time,  /
sd          B.12 utt3: {D say } if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place. /  

qw^d          A.13 utt1:   {D Well, } what about random testing, though. /  

b          B.14 utt1:   Oh. /  

qy          A.15 utt1:   Do you feel like that's an [ in-, + invasion ] of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested? /  

ng          B.16 utt1:   {F Uh, } not if it's done fairly.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {C And } that's probably my question is, [ how, + how ] do you know it's done fairly. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:   I don't know that you do.  /
sd          A.17 utt2:  If it's random, then it's random -- /  

b          B.18 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:   -- {C and } that's not necessarily fair. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:   {D Well, } they might tell you it's random. /  

b          A.21 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:   {C But then, } {D you know, } it's kind of like [ a, + a ] lottery.  /
sv          B.22 utt2:  Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries.    

b          A.23 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.24 utt1:   {D You know. } /  

sd          A.25 utt1:   {D Well, } [ I ha-, + I  know ] that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C and } it's not random. /  

b          B.26 utt1:   {F Oh, } I see.  /
qw          B.26 utt2: [ [ How'd, + how did  ] they,  + how do they ] pick their people? /  

sd          A.27 utt1:   {F Uh, } {D well, } I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season -- /  

b          B.28 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:   -- {C and } from that point on, {F uh, } [ at, + ] the N C double A does have something to do with it,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C but } it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each [ [ in-, + individu-, ] + individual ] institution to identify the ones that have the problem. /  

bk          B.30 utt1:   {F Oh, } I see.  /
%          B.30 utt2: {D So, }  do you ... -/  

sd          A.31 utt1:   [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time. /  

b          B.32 utt1:   Right.  /
qy          B.32 utt2:  {D Well, } do you think that should be implemented in the work place.  {D You know, } as like a manager or supervisor thinks or  has suspicion that someone is using drugs,  /
qy          B.32 utt3: do you think they should have the right to send them --   

na          A.33 utt1:   {D Well, } not being a --   

+          B.34 utt1:   -- to be tested. /  

+          A.35 utt1:   -- drug user I don't have a problem with that personally -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:   Right. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:   -- {C but } I think that might be a violation of someone's rights.  /
sv          A.37 utt2: If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to [ h-, + ] behave differently -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:   Right. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:   -- {C and } their manager assumes they have a drug problem -- /  

x          B.40 utt1:   <laughter>.   

sv          A.41 utt1:   -- {E I mean } if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset. /  

b          B.42 utt1: Right,  /
b^r          B.42 utt2: right.  /
b          B.42 utt3: Yeah,  /
%          B.42 utt4: [ it, + it ] would almost be like [ a, + a, ] {F uh } ... -/  

sv          A.43 utt1:   It's an accusation,  /
sv          A.43 utt2: [ [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it's --  +   

b          B.44 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.45 utt1: -- {C and } it's ] based [ on, + on ] a perception [ that someone has + ] as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, {F uh, } normal, {F uh, } {D you know. } /  

qh          B.46 utt1: {C And then } how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, {D you know, } your supervisor has accused you of using drugs. /  

b          A.47 utt1:   Right,  /
aa          A.47 utt2: exactly.  /
%          A.47 utt3: [ [ I, + I ]  don't,  /
sv          A.47 utt4: + [ the, + ] I think ] almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board [ from, + from ] the janitors to the executive management. /  

b          B.48 utt1:   Right.  /
aa          B.48 utt2:  I agree with that.  /
sd          B.48 utt3: {C Because } I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years,  /
sd          B.48 utt4:  it will be three years in August  /
sd          B.48 utt5: {C and } I've already been drug tested three times. /  

qw          A.49 utt1:   What type of job do you have? /  

sd          B.50 utt1:   {D Well, } I'm an environmental engineer -- /  

b          A.51 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:   -- {C and } I've been drug tested three times  /
sd          B.52 utt2: {C and } I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime  /
sd          B.52 utt3: {C and } the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus.  /
sd          B.52 utt4:  {C So } {D see } [ I, + for some reason, I've ] come up three times.  /
sd          B.52 utt5:  That's pretty high statistics. /  

qy          A.53 utt1:   {D Well, } [ does your r-, + does your job require ] you to drive company equipment or to [ ap-, +  operate ] any type of machinery that might --

ba          A.61 utt1:   That is odd.  /
sd          A.61 utt2:  I was drug tested, {F uh, } not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.61 utt3: {C but } I know [ that + [ they sent, + ]  that ] the job I had before, that, {D well, } - /

b          B.62 utt1:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.63 utt1:   -- {C so } I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or  because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion. /

qy          B.64 utt2: {D Well, } [ does [ your, + ]  the company {D say, } + for instance, does the company ] you worked for [ bef-, + before ] have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her  /
