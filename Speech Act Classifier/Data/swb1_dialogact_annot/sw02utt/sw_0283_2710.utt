sd          B.1 utt1:  I started when I was in college.  /
sd          B.1 utt2: {D You know, } they always offer credit cards for college students. /  

b          A.2 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.3 utt1:  {C So } I went ahead, and accepted every one that I was offered.    

b          A.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.5 utt1:   Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  {C So, } [ I p-, + I pack ] around a lot of them,  /
sd          B.7 utt2: {C but } I only use a few of them. /  

sv          A.8 utt1:  You have a lot of discipline.  /
sd          A.8 utt2:  They make it really easy for people [ to, + {F uh, } to ] get credit cards, especially college students. /  

b          B.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.10 utt1:  I have, {F uh, } two daughters [ who, + who ] both are in college  /
sd          A.10 utt2: {C or, }  in fact, one has finished now.  /
sd          A.10 utt3:  {C But } they both have <laughter> a lot of credit cards. /  

sd          B.11 utt1:  {C And } they give you such high credit limits. /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.13 utt1: [ It's, + it's ] easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap. /  

b          A.14 utt1:  {F Uh, } right.  /
sd          A.14 utt2: {C And then } [ they, + they ] give you, {F uh, } {F uh, } the credit limit,  /
sd          A.14 utt3: {C and  then } you're always [ s-, + seemingly ] up to that limit.  /
sd          A.14 utt4:  {D Now } I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them.  /
sd          A.14 utt5:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] how a lot of people get into trouble. /  

b          B.15 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.15 utt2: [  I've got, + I've got ] two [ that I, + {D you know, } that ] usually I'll have a balance on. /  

b          A.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  {C And then } all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card [ and, + and ] pay it off every month. /  

b          A.18 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.19 utt1:  {C And } that way I feel like I'm getting, {D you know, } a thirty day loan. /  

b          A.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.21 utt1:  {C But } I don't have to worry about, {D you know, } running them up too high, except at Christmas.  /
sd          B.21 utt2:  [  Then they usually go, + then they usually get ] run up pretty <laughter> good. /  

b          A.22 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.22 utt2: {D Well, } you have a lot of discipline.  /
sd          A.22 utt3: [  I, + {F uh, } I'm ] trying my best right now to pay off some of mine.  /
sd          A.22 utt4: [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] paid off about four credit cards this year. /  

 b         B.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.24 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] still I have some that [ are, + <laughter> are ] up to the limit.  /
sd          A.24 utt2: {C And } especially the Visa Card --   

b          B.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.26 utt1:  -- that you can go and get cash on <laughter>. /  

x          B.27 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.28 utt1:  {C And } it seems like every time I'm short of cash, I just go [ get, + get ] it from Visa. /  

%          B.29 utt1:  {D Now } [ that's one, + that's ] - /
sd          B.29 utt2: I've never used my Visa for cash before. /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qy^d          B.31 utt1:  Can you use it {D like } at a bank machine  /
%          B.31 utt2:  j-, -- -/  

b          A.32 utt1:  {F Uh, } /  

%          B.33 utt1:  -- {C or, } -/  

sd          A.34 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say, "I want a cash advance."  /
sd          A.34 utt2: {C Or } if they've sent you [ a, + {F uh, } a ] number that you can use.  {D You know, } [ a, + a ] personal identification number --   

b          B.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.36 utt1:  -- that you can use in the, {F uh, } impact machines or whatever, [ you, +   

bk          B.37 utt1:  # {F Oh, } okay. # /  

+          A.38 utt1:  # you ] can do # that.  /
sd          A.38 utt2:  {C Because } I have one that I don't have a pin number for.  /
sd          A.38 utt3: {D You know, } sometimes you have to ask them for that. /  

b          B.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.40 utt1:  {C And then } I have one that, {F uh, } just gave me the pin number automatically. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:  {D Now } we got, - /
sd          B.41 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] funny you said that.  Because [ we got a credit card, + {F uh, } my husband and I got credit cards ] in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for. /  

b          A.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

x           B.43 utt1: /
sd          B.43 utt2: {D Now } a couple of weeks later [ we got, + we got  ] pin numbers,  /
sd          B.43 utt3: {C and then } we got, {F uh, } a bill saying, {D you know, } {F uh, } the yearly fee, it was like forty dollars. /  

b          A.44 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.45 utt1:  {C And } [ we, + we ] cut them up and sent them back because [ we, + we ] hadn't even applied for them,  /
sd          B.45 utt2: {C and } we didn't want them.  /
sd          B.45 utt3:  {C But } [ they, + they ] had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us. /  

ba          A.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow!  <Laughter>. /  

sd          B.47 utt1:  {C So } I thought, {D man, } I don't know if I trust this or not <laughter>. /  

sd          A.48 utt1:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } [ they, + they ] do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time.  /
sd          A.48 utt2: [ [  Ev-, + ev-, ] + everybody ] in the world will offer you [ a, + a ] credit card. /  

sd(^q)          B.49 utt1:  It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills <laughter>. /  

x          A.50 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.51 utt1:  {C But } it's hard,  /
sd(^q)          B.51 utt2: {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] tempting when you see something to say, "Well, I'll just charge it."  /
sd          B.51 utt3:  {C And } sometimes I'll do that,  /
sd          B.51 utt4: {C but } usually I, I will try to pay everything off the next month  /
sd          B.51 utt5: {C or } --   

b          A.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.53 utt1:  -- the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time,  [ I'll, + I'll  ] pay more than the minimum payment. /  

b          A.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.55 utt1:  Just [ I fe-, + I feel ] like even that little bit helps. /  

b          A.56 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.56 utt2:  {D Well, } {D you know, } the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that, I think [ we, + we ] really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible.  /
sd          A.56 utt3: [  That's, + that's ] why [ I've, + I've ] really started to try [ to, + to ] pay off mine and get out of debt.  Because we never know when we might, {D you know, } get laid off or --   

ba          B.57 utt1:  I know it. /  

+          A.58 utt1:  -- something.  /
sd          A.58 utt2:  Especially me.  /
sd          A.58 utt3:  I work for Texas Instruments,  /
sd          A.58 utt4: {C and } they've [ had, + had ] a lot [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } layoffs lately. /

bh          A.60 utt1:  You do? /  

sd          B.61 utt1:  {C And } I think they're getting ready [ to, + to ] probably sell us out, our division. /  

qw          A.62 utt1:  Where are you? /

ny          A.68 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.69 utt1:  {C So, }  {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards. /  

ba          A.70 utt1: [ It, + it ] certainly is.  /
sd          A.70 utt2: [  I've, + {F uh, } I have ] worked on a [ part, + part ] time job, {F uh, } where I was a collector.    

b          B.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

aa          A.84 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.84 utt2: {C Because } [ every, + every ] month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau, {D you know. }  Automatically, [ mo-, + most ] of them do. /  

ba          B.85 utt1:  I didn't realize that. /  

b          A.86 utt1:  Yeah.  /

sd          B.99 utt1:  That's something I never thought about getting, {D you know, } checking with to see [ what, + what ] your credit report looked like. /  

b          A.100 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.100 utt2:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] can do that.  /
sd          A.100 utt3:  I believe it costs about ten dollars. /  

ba          B.101 utt1:  Might be worth it for peace of mind. /  

aa          A.102 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
sd          A.102 utt2: It is,  /
sd^r          A.102 utt3: it is.  /

b          B.103 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.104 utt1:  If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like  that.  /

sd          B.105 utt1:  I think that Discover Card has a good idea with, {D you know, } giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount [ you, + you ] purchase.  As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back. /  

 b         A.106 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.107 utt1:  {C And } since they don't have the yearly fee. /

b          A.114 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.115 utt1:  I would think it wouldn't be, {D you know, } much more than the eighteen or  nineteen percent everyone else charges. /
