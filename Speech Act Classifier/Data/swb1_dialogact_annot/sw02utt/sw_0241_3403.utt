sd          B.6 utt4:  I was from Illinois,  /
sd          B.6 utt5: {C and } my favorite team was the White Sox. /  

qy^g          A.7 utt1:  Not a Cubbies fan, {F huh. } /  

nn          B.8 utt1:  No,  /

^h          A.15 utt1:  {D Well, } I'll tell you.  /
sd          A.15 utt2:  I just, {F uh, } moved down from South Dakota in July,  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and, }  {F uh, } in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living -- /  

 b         B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.17 utt1:  -- {C and so } everybody was a Twins fan,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C and } I [ was kind of, + ] {F uh, } didn't have much interest in the Twins, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.17 utt3: [  it was, + it was ] kind of pathetic, {E I mean, }  /
sd          A.17 utt4: we only had two radio stations,  /
sd          A.17 utt5: {C and } one of them broadcast every Twins game live, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.17 utt6: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] the other one was country. /  

qy^g          B.18 utt1:  <Laughter> {C So } you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you. /  

na          A.19 utt1:  <Laughter> {C So, }  that's right. /  

x          B.20 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.21 utt1:  There's was Twins there, or, {D you know } --

+          A.23 utt1:  -- Skip Williams. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  {F Oh, } {F uh, } {C and } I was routing for the Twins myself because, {F uh, } [ they, + ] a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here, {F uh, } went to Minnesota,  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C and } we used to tease [ about, + ] my son  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota,  /
sv          B.24 utt5: {C but } [ it was int-, + it certainly was ] an exciting Series, anyway. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  It sure was,  /
aa^r          A.25 utt2: it sure was. /  

qo          B.26 utt1:  What do you think going to happen to the Rangers? /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I -- +   

qrr          B.28 utt1:  {C Or } can we predict? /  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- I ] would like to [ [ a-, + a-, ] + assume ] that they're going to [ do, + do ] better this coming year,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: I was sure hopeful anyway.  /
sd          A.29 utt3:  When we moved down, {F uh, } I was able to go to my first, {D you know } baseball game, and --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- thought, this is great, this is incredible.  /
sd          A.31 utt2:  {C So } I became a Rangers fan.  /
sd          A.31 utt3: I didn't really have one in South Dakota.  /
sd          A.31 utt4: {C So } I adopted the Rangers,  /
sd          A.31 utt5: {C or } rather they adopted me, I guess -- /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } it was just exciting, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.33 utt2: you can watch baseball on T V  /
sd          A.33 utt3: {C and } they hit the long ball,  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C and } it looks like wow, they really hit that ball.  /
sv          A.33 utt5: {C But } when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far --   

aa          B.34 utt1:  No. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- {D you know, }  /
sv          A.35 utt2: {C and } it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you,  /
%          A.35 utt3: {C and. } -/  

fe          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh, } isn't it though.  /
sv          B.36 utt2:  {D You know, } {C but, }  {F oh, } [ I, + I ] think going to the ball park just really makes it.  Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you're more a part of it too. /  

ba          A.37 utt1:  That's right,  /
ba^r          A.37 utt2: that's right. /

b^m          A.39 utt1:  The Restaurant Ha-, -/  

sd          B.40 utt1:  The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C and } --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Huh. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- he, {F uh, } says he's coming back, {D you know, } {F uh, }  /
sd          B.42 utt2: he doesn't know how many years --   

b          A.43 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  -- {E I mean, } to pitch.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: He'll be at least one more,  /
sd          B.44 utt3: {C and } he said he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.  /
sd          B.44 utt4:  He likes it. /  

ba          A.45 utt1:  That's right -- /

sv          B.50 utt2: [ he's, + he's ] such a nice man. /  

qy          A.51 utt1:  {D Well, } didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers? /  

ny          B.52 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.52 utt2: {C and } he, - /
sd          B.52 utt3: {D you know } when he quits at being active, he will go into, {D you know } --   

^2          A.53 utt1:  Management. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  -- [ being a, + ] managing and, {D yeah, } {D you know, } being a coach, I'm sure. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.56 utt1:  {C But, } [  he's, + {F uh, } he ] certainly is a good example, {F uh, } for the kids. /  

ba          A.57 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {D You know, } you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see what a fine man, that, he is. /  

%          A.59 utt1:  {D You know, } some of the, - /
sd          A.59 utt2: {D like, } {F uh, } Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born [ when, + when, ] {F uh, } Nolan Ryan started pitching. /  

ba          B.60 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  {C And } it's just incredible to think that [ there's, + {F uh, } there are ] players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan --   

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.63 utt1:  -- or with Nolan, {D you know, }  /

sd          B.64 utt4:  His son pitched for U T  /
sd          B.64 utt5: {C and } he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers. /  

nn          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /

qy          A.67 utt1:  Was it Nolan against, {F uh } -- -/

sd          B.72 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } only, {F uh, } Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  A game is a game, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.74 utt2: {D Well, } the Rangers really, {F uh, } knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect --   

 b         A.75 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.76 utt1:  -- {D you know, } anyway,  /
sd          B.76 utt2: {C but } Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something, {D you know, } of the game  /
