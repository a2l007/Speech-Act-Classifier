o          A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  {F Uh, } generally I get, {F uh, } {D you know, } most of my news, {F uh, } in the, {D you know, } weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. [ With, + with ] occasional smatterings [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper. /

sd          A.3 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ my, + my ] only complaint is I really don't enough time [ to, + to ] look at the articles every day [ and, + and ] go through a paper, {D you know, } exhaust the details.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  {C So } that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. /  

qy          B.4 utt1:  Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? /

sd          A.7 utt1: [ {C And, } +  {C and so } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] like the weekly magazines, {F uh, } because [ i-, + it ] gives me, {D you know, } the high points of what's going on. /

sv          A.9 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } many times, {F uh, } <sigh> {D you know, } [ [ the, + the  local, ] + {F uh, } the local ] news kind of suffers, {D you know. }  /

x          B.16 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

sv          A.17 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ i-, + it ] turns out [ [ that, + {F uh, } that, ] + that ] the C N N [ is, + I think, is ] great.    

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  And [ for, + for ] things like hurricanes and fast breaking events  /
sv          A.19 utt2: {C but } generally, [ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're ] more sound bitish, {D you know, } kind of thing  /

sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: {C And } while there's an inherent, {F uh, } filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read, {F uh, } I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of, {F uh, } favoring the other side.  /
sv          B.26 utt4: [ That's, + that's ] potential indication of balance.  /
