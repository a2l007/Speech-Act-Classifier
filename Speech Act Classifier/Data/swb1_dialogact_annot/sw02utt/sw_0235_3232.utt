sd          B.24 utt1:  {F Oh, } {F um, } the service. /  

bk          A.25 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } that was one of the things I was thinking about in school, {F um, }  /
sd          A.27 utt2: I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock --   

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } I had a friend,  my roommate went to Tech also,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C but } she was from New Mexico -- /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  -- {C and } she had to pay out of state tuition -- /  

ba          B.32 utt1:  Ooh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  -- {C and } I think that would have, {F uh, } played a real big part of my decision -- /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  <Laughter>  It would have played a major part in mine. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  -- {D yeah, } because, {F um, } she was pay-, - /
sd          A.35 utt2: of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now.  /
sd          A.35 utt3:  It was like four dollars a semester hour -- /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  -- {C and so } I was going to school for, {D you know, } just a few hundred dollars a semester,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C and } she was paying forty dollars an hour -- /  

ba          B.38 utt1:  Golly, /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- {C so } she paid ten times as much because she was out of state. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time. /  

ba          A.41 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's good.  /
b          A.41 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {C so } I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider <laughter> --   

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh, {F um, } /  

+          A.43 utt1:  -- try to find a school within the state that, {F um, } I liked well enough to attend. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  The second thing is some colleges only offer the, {F uh, } liberal arts --    

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- [ and, + ] {F uh, } whereas like State, they offer engineering courses -- /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Right,  /
b          A.47 utt2: yeah. /  

sv      B.48 utt1:  -- {C so } depending on what your major is, or medical, you might want to  [ atteck-, some, +  {F um, } attend somewhere ] like Tech -- /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.49 utt2: right. /  

%          B.50 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } aside from the, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.50 utt2: {D well } some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.51 utt2: that's true,  /
sd          A.51 utt3: that was something else I had, was, I had government aid, of course,  /
sd          A.51 utt4: {C but, }  {F uh, } it was wonderful, because I got one of those grants that you don't have to repay -- /  

b          B.52 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

%          A.53 utt1:  -- {C and, }  yeah,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: it was so nice -- /  

b          B.54 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  -- it paid most of my tuition, and, {F um, } a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing  /
%          A.55 utt2: {C so. } -/  

ba          B.56 utt1:  Wow, that's great. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.57 utt2: I really, -/  

qy          B.58 utt1:  Was it a Pell grant? /  

br          A.59 utt1:  I'm sorry, what did you say? /  

qw          B.60 utt1:  What kind of grant was it? /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  {D Well, } it was called a B E O G, a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant -- /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.63 utt1:  -- {C and } it was from the government,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: {C and } [ it was based, + at first it was based ] on my parents' income.  /
sd          A.63 utt3:  My parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.65 utt1:  {C And so, } {F uh, } because based on the number of children and the amount of money, {F uh, } my father brought in, I got a small grant -- /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  -- {C but } then after that, I was on my own, working and, {D you know, } trying to go to school on my own.  /
sd          A.67 utt2: {C So then } I got a real big grant, because the --   

ba          B.68 utt1:  Wow. /  

+          A.69 utt1:  -- amount of money I was making really didn't compare <laughter>. /  

b          B.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.71 utt1:  {C So, }  it was kind of nice. /  

%          B.72 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.73 utt1:  I don't know if those are still available or not,  /

%          B.74 utt1:  {F Uh, } I'm not quite, - /
sd          B.74 utt2: [ there's, + there's ] a lot of different organizations [ who, + {F uh, } who ] do give grants,  /
sd          B.74 utt3: {C but, }  {F uh, } <inhaling> I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much, [ they, + {D you know, } they ] generally run. /  

b         A.75 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r         A.75 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.75 utt3: this was great,  /
sd          A.75 utt4: it was just based on, {D you know, } how much your tuition costs and everything,  /
sd          A.75 utt5: {C and } generally it paid everything,  /
sd          A.75 utt6: {C so } --   

 b         B.76 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.77 utt1:  -- I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing,  /
%          A.77 utt2: {C so } that was, -/

aa          A.79 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.79 utt2: it was really nice. /  

o          B.80 utt1:  {F Oh, } another thing.  /
sd          B.80 utt2: [ I've got a, + I've got a ] degree from another college -- /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.82 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } something that might play a part is the size of the college. /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.84 utt1:  {F Uh, }  ((   ))  the smaller schools can give you [ a lot, + {F uh, } a lot ] more specialized instruction --   

b          A.85 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.86 utt1:  -- and attention than the larger schools -- /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.88 utt1:  -- in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy,  /

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.90 utt1:  -- {C and } ] they just give you a teacher's assistants, {D you know } -- /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  -- instead of a scholar you get a T A -- /  

ba          A.93 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.94 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } you don't get near the, {F uh, } quality of education <cough>,  /
sd          B.94 utt2: {C and } as well, the, {F uh, } smaller schools often times don't cost as much. /  

sd          A.95 utt1:  {F Um, } I didn't know that. /  

b          B.96 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          A.97 utt1:  {F Um. }  {D Well, } I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between [ a, + a ] Christian college, because I thought about attending Abilene Christian --   

b          B.98 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.99 utt1:  -- instead of Texas Tech -- /
