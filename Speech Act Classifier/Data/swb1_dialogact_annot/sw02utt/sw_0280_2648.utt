REMARKS:        Speaker A kept interrupting herself with new ideas, etc. 
She was very choppy.  The conversation cut out in both the second and
third conversations, luckily it was pretty clear the first time.

===========================================================================
  

sv^t          A.1 utt1:  {C So, }  {D well, } this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,  /
%          A.1 utt2: {C so. } -/  

b          B.2 utt1:  Right. /  

qw          A.3 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } what do you think is, {F uh, } [ the pollutants, + the main pollutants ] in the air? /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that [ I just, + {F uh, } I ] think they put off so much  /
sv          B.4 utt2: {C and } they're not regulated enough. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.5 utt2:  (( {D well } )) , that's me too.  /
%          A.5 utt3:  After, {F um, } - /
sd          A.5 utt4: on channel thirteen, {F uh, } they had [ some, + some ] programs the day before,  /
sd          A.5 utt5: {C and } I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,  /
sd          A.5 utt6: {C but } the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, {D you know, } how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do,   

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  as the people  /
sd          A.7 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot, /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C and } that actually, {F um, } as our population increases and, {D you know, } [ [ [ our, + of course, our, ] + our cars, ] + {D you know, } our number of cars ] increase per the population, that's the problem.  But also like you said the industry pollution  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } [ they're reg-, + they're  regulation ] that's placed on them  [ is, + {E I mean, } it's  ] better than it used to be  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C but } it's incredible that [ [ they still don't have, + {D you know, } they don't, ] + they're not made ] to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.11 utt1:  {D You know, } [ I, + I ] just, - /
sd          A.11 utt2: I can't  (( stand that ))  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {C and } I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that, - /
sd          A.11 utt4: {D you know, } they're supposed to be regulated because [ [ we have a, + we have a ] plant, + I don't know about T I but we have [ a plant, + {F uh, } a Pillsbury plant, ]  ]    

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  [ in, + in ] a town adjacent to ours,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C and } I know people that work there that, - /
sd          A.13 utt3: of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals, /  

aa          B.14 utt1:  No. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C but } they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of [ the, + ] {F um, } what they do, {F uh, } to, {F uh, } make their dough  and [ st-, + ] to,    

bh          B.16 utt1:  Really? /  

+          A.17 utt1:  clean out the flour and stuff like that,  /
b          A.17 utt2: yeah, /  

b          B.18 utt1: {F Huh. } /  

sv          A.19 utt1: {E I mean, } it's incredible.  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C And, } {F um, } they said that [ they're, + {D you know, } they have ] a little creek that runs by them  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C and } some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, {D you know, } shut down everything  /
 sd         A.19 utt4: {C and } they clean up their act,  but on a normal basis [ that they're, +  that they're ] dumping things,   

 b         B.20 utt1:  Oh. /  

 +         A.21 utt1:  that they're not supposed to be dumping,  /
 sd         A.21 utt2: {C and } I'm like, if they're getting away with it,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  can you imagine,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: [ that's a, + that's a ] Pillsbury plant  /
sd          A.23 utt3: I can't imagine plants, -/  

sd          B.24 utt1: I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury [ [ could, + would, the, ] + {E I mean, } {E or } even had ] chem-, + {D you know, }  {D well, } - /
%          B.24 utt2: those chemicals (( would )) not, -/  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and  stuff,   

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.27 utt1: {D you know } [ to, + to ] break the flours down  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C and then } [ they, + they ] also do testing there,  /
%          A.27 utt3: {C and } I don't, - /
sv          A.27 utt4: {D you know, } [ wh-, + when ] you consider, {D you know, } it's probably not radioactive  /
sv          A.27 utt5: {C but } toxic [ can be, + can be ] anything that's [ cr-, + ] {F uh, } classified that can damage the Earth. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.28 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {C So, }  there could be a lot of things that they could put, {D you know, } that chemical wise that they use to, {F uh, } that they are testing with,    

b          B.30 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {D you know, } like [ in, +   

+          A.31 utt1:  that they're dumping.  /
b          A.31 utt2: Yeah. /  

 +         B.32 utt1:  In ] packaging  /
%          B.32 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } just goodness. -/  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: I don't think they do the packaging at this plant, /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C but } [ they do, + they do ] a lot of research  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {C and } [ they do, + {F um, } they [ do, + do ] ] a lot of the refining up there  /
%          A.35 utt3: {C or, } -/  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.37 utt1:  I'm not really, - /
sd          A.37 utt2: what's it called when you do flour, - /
%          A.37 utt3: I'm not, -/  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {F Uh, } only thing I can think is bleaching  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C but, }  {E I mean, } [ I, +   

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  I ] don't know [ what's, + ] how they do the flour. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {C But, }  {F um, } [ we, + we're ] on the southwest side of  Houston  /
sd          B.42 utt2: we don't have that much as far as, {F uh, }  (( aiming in ))  the plants over on this, {F uh, } the [ we-, + ] east side does. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  We've got Imperial sugar  /
sd          B.44 utt2: [ {C but, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] [ they're, + {D you know, } they're ] right there on the creek also  /
 sd         B.44 utt3: {C and, }  {F uh, } they've been there for years. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.46 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } -/  

%          A.47 utt1:  {C But, }  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  {E I mean, } you think about [ it, + it, ] {D you know, }  /
sv          A.47 utt3: it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just, - /
h          A.47 utt4: I'm not really sure  /
sv          A.47 utt5: {C but } I would think it would be easier to detect those  things because you could detect them down [ strean-, +  {E or } stream ] or such, /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  {C or } [ you can, + you can, ] {D you know, } do, {F uh, } testing on the ground itself at that point, /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {C but } when they pollute into the air [ and you've got, + {D you know, } and you've got ] movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.  /
sd          A.51 utt2: {C So, }  I don't see, {D you know, } how they can do some of the te-, - /
sd          A.51 utt3: unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, {D you know, } like in Los Angeles [ or, + or ] the bigger cities where [ it, + it ] tends to get stuck there, -/  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air,    

b          B.54 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.54 utt2: yeah. /  

 +         A.55 utt1:  {D you know, } [ [ [ per, + per, ] + {F uh, } per ] + particles  ] in the surrounding community because it's not moved away, /  

 b         B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.57 utt1:  {C but, }  {F um, } -/

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C and } I think, {D well, } what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, {D you know, } it sinked in through the ground and  all that, /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.61 utt2: {D well, } I know out in some, - /
h          A.61 utt3: I'm not sure,  /
