=========================================================================
  

 br         A.1 utt1:  Huh?  /
b          A.1 utt2:  Okay. /  

h          B.2 utt1:  I don't know how much I know about this subject <laughter>. /  

h          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't know if I know anything or not, /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {C but } [ I've, + I've ] got some opinions on it. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Okay.  /
ad          B.6 utt2:  Go ahead. /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  {D See } those type of people [ that, + that ] have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything <laughter>. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I've had teenagers  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and } I now have grandchildren that are teenagers,  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C and } I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.  /
 sv         A.9 utt4:  {F Uh, } I think this "me" generation has gone far too far.  /
 sv         A.9 utt5:  {C And } the young people are overly impressed.  /
 sv         A.9 utt6:  {C And } I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a [ m-, +  far more ] disadvantaged viewpoint. /  

ba          B.10 utt1:  That's true. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {F Uh, } I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {F Um, } me either.  /
sd          B.12 utt2: [ I, + I ] went to college and then started working and then got married  /
%          B.12 utt3: {C and, } -/  

%          A.13 utt1:  {C But } they have, - /
 sd         A.13 utt2: I read somewhere, - /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] out on a limb here, some type of college, {F uh, } volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C and } they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, {F uh, } lower income brackets of the United States.  /
qy          A.13 utt5:  Have you ever heard about that one? /  

nn          B.14 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.14 utt2: I haven't,  /
sd          B.14 utt3: I know that, {F uh, } my sister, - /
sd          B.14 utt4: I have a twin sister  /
sd          B.14 utt5: {C and } when they graduated she went to, {F uh, } teach in a small town down in south Texas  /
sd          B.14 utt6: {C and } I know, that {D like } if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, {D you know, } your college note or whatever. -/  

bh          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

ny          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: If it's {D like, } {D you know, } really [ a, + {D you know, } a ] lower paying job, {D you know, } where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as [ to, + {D you know, } to  ] live. -/  

qy^d          A.17 utt1:  {C And } this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education? /  

ny          B.18 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.18 utt2: she only taught there one year  /
%          B.18 utt3: {C but } I, -/  

qy^d          A.19 utt1:  {C But } she got credits for it? /  

ny          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ba          A.21 utt1:  That's very interesting. /  

%          B.22 utt1:  {C And, }  {F um, } I think it would be, - /
sd          B.22 utt2: I know that also one of my cousins who, {F uh, } he is in {D like } the therapy type  (( thing ))  /
%          B.22 utt3:  {C and } he was, {F um, } - /
sd          B.22 utt4: some group paid part of his college income  /
sd          B.22 utt5: {C but then } he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sd          B.22 utt6: {E I mean, } it's a nursing home or something like that. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Huh. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {C So, } {D you know, } if, - /
sv          B.24 utt2: I think that's a good way [ for people to, + {D you know, } maybe get people to ] come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.25 utt2: I think that is an excellent program,  /
sv          A.25 utt3: I really do.  /
sd          A.25 utt4:  I like that.  /
sv          A.25 utt5: {C And } [ it's, + it's ] beneficial to the small towns too because,   

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  they [ really, + really ] [ have, + have ] a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex. /  

^2          B.28 utt1:  As far as [ ge-, + {D yeah, } getting ] doctors and all that stuff, yeah. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {D you know, } [ if, + if ] we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient, /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {C but } we could find one. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like  that. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C So, } [ I, + I ] can see the advantage to that one.  /
qy^g          A.35 utt2: The Peace Corps itself is really [ a, + ] {F uh, } dying out, isn't it? /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I really don't know that much about it,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {D you know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think of the Peace  Corps, {D you know, } more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when, -/  

 sd         A.37 utt1:  It's still in existence. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah.  /
qy          B.38 utt2:  {C And } don't they go into other countries and stuff? /  

na          A.39 utt1:  I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm,   

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  {F uh, } dig their own wells, set up,   

%          B.42 utt1:  Things that make the, - /
b          B.42 utt2: yeah. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  their schools. /  

qy^d          B.44 utt1:  Make them more self-supporting? /  

ny          A.45 utt1:  Yes.  /
%          A.45 utt2:  They, -/  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.48 utt2:  Yeah. /  

o          A.49 utt1:  {C And, }  yes,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: you're right,  /
sd          A.49 utt3: I think it's a sixties program.  /
sd          A.49 utt4: I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points  that he, - /
sd          A.49 utt5: that was his big deal. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {C But } it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it. -/  

b          A.51 utt1:  Right.  /
b^r          A.51 utt2:  Right.  /
sd          A.51 utt3:  {F Um, } <<pause>>, I think [ I, + I've ] singled out my grandchildren  /
sd          A.51 utt4: [ {C and } + {C but } ] {D actually } [ they're, + they're ] pretty good,   

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C but } at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.55 utt1:  {C But } there's a, -/  

sd          B.56 utt1: [ I don't, + I don't ] know that you could require everyone [ to,   

^2          A.57 utt1:  Mandatory just  [ like, +   

+          B.58 utt1:  do that for, +  {D yeah, }   

+          A.59 utt1:  like  ] the draft. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  to do it for ] a whole year,   

aa          A.61 utt1:  No. /  

+          B.62 utt1:  or two years or something like that,  /
sd          B.62 utt2: I don't know that that would work if,   

^2          A.63 utt1:  Every time you, -/  

+          B.64 utt1:  somebody's, [ was, + ] didn't really want to be there and didn't have, -/  

sv          A.65 utt1:  They could buy their way out. /  

aa          B.66 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.66 utt2: {E I mean, } there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else <laughter>. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.67 utt2: {D you know, } [ they, + they'd ] figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.  /
sd          A.67 utt3: {C But, }  <<pause>>, I'm wondering if there's another issue here,  /
sv          A.67 utt4: {C and } maybe this is why this has died out.  /
%          A.67 utt5:  Can you go into, - /
sd^t          A.67 utt6: {C and } this wasn't the question  /
sv          A.67 utt7: {C but } [ it's, + it ] may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, - /
qy          A.67 utt8: can they go in there and can anyone go [ into, + {D well, } out of ] - /
sd          A.67 utt9: the  (( Kurdish ))  community is a little bit extreme at this time,  /
sv          A.67 utt10: {C but } {D say, } I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or [ some, + some ]  really desperate situation  /
qy          A.67 utt11: {C and } teach them to farm {C and } teach them - /
sv          A.67 utt12: {C and } it doesn't do any good. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  I don't know that it does.  /
sd          A.69 utt2: [ I, + I, ]   

b          B.70 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.71 utt1:  don't know that, {F um, } if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.  /
sv          A.71 utt2:  {D You know, } we're losing certain,   

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.73 utt1:  races of people.  /
sv          A.73 utt2:  There are people now that are obsolete point and fact [ just, + just ] like endangered species of animals, so there are  (( quote ))  tribes of people,   

b          B.74 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.75 utt1:  that are endangered or obsolete.  /
sv          A.75 utt2:  {C And } I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being  (( winnowed ))  out.  /
sd          A.75 utt3:  There's a German word for it that's elegant,  /
sd          A.75 utt4: {C but } I never can remember what it was,  /
sd          A.75 utt5: {F uh, } [ {C but, } +  {C but } ] [ that they're, + they're ] being  (( winnowed ))  because [ they're, + ] where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.76 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } one of the quick examples is the Aborigines. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          B.78 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  {F Uh, } when we were in Australia, <<pause>>, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.79 utt2: sad little things.  {F Uh, } I felt sorry for them.  Because their society isn't there anymore,  /
sd          A.79 utt3: {C and } their (( belief ))  system and [ [ a-, + all ] their structured of theirs, + all the structures of their  ] society are gone, essentially. /  

b          B.80 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.81 utt1:  {C And } they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else  /
sv          A.81 utt2: {C and } that's sad. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.83 utt1:  {C But } I don't think there's any way [ you could go, + {F uh, } the Peace Corps could go ] in and rescue those people,  /
sv          A.83 utt2: {C and } I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either. /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.85 utt1:  {C So, } [ I, + I'm ] wondering if the Peace Corps is,   

%          B.86 utt1:  {D Well, } -/  

+          A.87 utt1:  really an effective tool. /  

sd          B.88 utt1:  Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and,    

ba          A.89 utt1:  Good point. /  

+          B.90 utt1:  could be helped. /  

sv          A.91 utt1:  We've got enough [ without lea-, + without ] a passport  /
sv          A.91 utt2: there's plenty. /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.93 utt1:  Yes.  /
sv          A.93 utt2:  I think we ought to worry about our own species. /  

sv          B.94 utt1:  {C And } maybe rather than just, require somebody to join {D like } the Peace Corps for a year maybe {D like, }  {F um, } during college, {D you know, } maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States. /  

%          A.95 utt1:  I wonder now in, - /
sd          A.95 utt2: {C and } I've been out of school too long to answer this,  /
sd          A.95 utt3: {C but } I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses. /  

sv          B.96 utt1:  There probably are, {D you know, }  /
%          B.96 utt2: for - /
sv          B.96 utt3: {C but } I'm sure, - /
sv          B.96 utt4: that's probably like people that do that [ are, + are ] the people that are going to go into social work and  stuff  /
sv          B.96 utt5: {C but } I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, {D you know, } and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, {F um, } help these people, {D you know, }  /
%          B.96 utt6: {C and } no-, - /
sd          B.96 utt7: I'm not saying just give them money - /
sd          B.96 utt8:  {C but, } {E I mean, } {C because } they have to be taught to be, -/  

sv          A.97 utt1:  That's the last thing you want,    

b          B.98 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

+          A.99 utt1:  to do. /  

sv          B.100 utt1:  {E I mean, } I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, {D you know, } when you give these people money  /
^h          B.100 utt2: {C or, }  <breathing>, what was it  /
sd          B.100 utt3: they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, {F um, } more money to these people,  /
sv          B.100 utt4: {E I mean, } {C and } that's not really the answer,   (( {E I mean } )) , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend,   

aa          A.101 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.101 utt2: that's exactly it. /  

+          B.102 utt1:  it on, {D you know, } booze or something like that,  /
%          B.102 utt2: {C but. } -/  

sv          A.103 utt1:  They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it.  /
ad          A.103 utt2: {D Now } come on,  let's be realistic, /  

b          B.104 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.105 utt1:  that's just not realistic. /
