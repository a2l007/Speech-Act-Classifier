sv          B.70 utt1:  {D So } that was pretty. /  

sd          A.71 utt1:  {C And } to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, {D you know, } you could follow [ this, + this ] beaten down path, /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.73 utt1:  {C and } it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing. /
