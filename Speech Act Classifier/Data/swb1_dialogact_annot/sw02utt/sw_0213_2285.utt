o          A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  {D Well } like I was saying, Burlington's crime, it doesn't involve children  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C and, }  what you see on the T V -s [ from, + {D you know, } in ] Washington and New York. - /
sv          A.1 utt4: {C So } what I believe the people want, - /
sd^t          A.1 utt5: the subject [ is, + is ] big city crime, which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about,  /
sd          A.1 utt6: {C but } I have, {D you know, } concerns,  /
sd          A.1 utt7: {C and } --   

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.3 utt1:  -- I have a few ideas of, {F um, } how to combat it.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  {E I mean, }  [ I  don't, + I don't ] think, ideally, {D you know, } you need money to do everything  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C so } --   

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  -- That's one thing  /
sd          A.5 utt2: [ [ that, + that's, ] + that's ] crime that you can't fight it if you need that money.  /
%          A.5 utt3:  # {C So. } # -/  

b          B.6 utt1: # Right, #  /
b          B.6 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.6 utt3: {D well, } when, {F uh, } we lived in San Antonio,  /
sd          B.6 utt4: I grew up around San Antonio,  /
sd          B.6 utt5: {C and } it's always been a very large, {F uh, } city, and increasingly growing.  /
sd          B.6 utt6:  It's has kind of the split population.  /
sd          B.6 utt7: {F Um, } there's a lot of retired military, {F uh, } individuals that live there,  /
sd          B.6 utt8: {C and then } there's a very large Hispanic population there.  /
sd          B.6 utt9:  {C And } the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic, {F uh, } gang crime in the city -- /  

  b        A.7 utt1: # {F Oh, } # /  

 sd         B.8 utt1:  -- # {C and } # that has, {F uh, } been the worse thing that we've seen happening. /  

 qy^d         A.9 utt1:  Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into [ the more + the, ] {F uh, } retired people's community,  /
qrr          A.9 utt2: {C or } does it stay in the bad neighborhoods? /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {F Um, } the majority of the actual gang crimes, like [ the pat-, +  the drive by shootings ] and stuff stays in the neighborhoods,  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C but } the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies, rape {C and, }  {F uh, } car crime.  /
sd          B.10 utt3: There's a [ very large, + {F uh, } {E or } very high ] percentage of car theft.  /
sd          B.10 utt4:  {C And }  [ San An-, + San Antonio's ] not far from the border to Mexico,  /
sd          B.10 utt5: {C so } a lot of the, {F uh, } cars go to, {F uh, } {D you know, }  ((   ))  shops,  /
sd          B.10 utt6: {C and } they take them apart,  /
sd          B.10 utt7: {C and } a lot of them go over the border, especially like Mercedes.  /
sd          B.10 utt8: A lot of [ those, + those ] in  [ [ the, + the  ]   Z, + {F uh, } the  Z  ] cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border,  /
%          B.10 utt9: {C and } {F uh } -- -/  

qy^d          A.11 utt1:  {C So } that's a big concern if you live there,   

na          B.12 utt1:  -- # very much so, # /  

+          A.13 utt1: # is to really lock your car up # . /  

na^r          B.14 utt1:  very much so,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: in fact, for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light, they had a rash of [ where people were, + when people were ] stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and  hold them up.  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  {C So } now, ever since then, when you drive into the city, most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car, until they get down there,  /
sd          B.14 utt4: {C and } once you've reached [ the, + the ] river walk area, which is the tourist area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys, [ and, + ] {F um, } {D you know, } or alone.  /
sd          B.14 utt5:  If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops, it's very nice.  /
sd          B.14 utt6:  {C But } [ at, + at ] evening, {F um, } again, [ you, + they ] have the high tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice,  /
sd          B.14 utt7: {C but } you don't want to get off the beaten track.  /
sd          B.14 utt8:  {F Um, } there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight.  /
sd          B.14 utt9:  {C And so } you don't want to get caught in the parking garage, {F uh, } alone. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D my, } it sounds like, {F um, } San Juan, Puerto Rico,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: we were there just, {D well } for a lay over -- /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } {D well, } it wasn't a lay over,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: [ [ we were, + we had, ] + we were ] staying at the other end of the island,  /
sd          A.17 utt3: {C and } we drove into San Juan to catch our plane. /  

 b         B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  It was at night,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C and } this boy really wanted to go on the beach,  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C and } they look at you crazy -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- you don't go on the beach. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  -- {D Well, } it's a big tourist town, {D you know, }  /
^q          A.23 utt2: [ don't they, + don't people ] go for a walk on the beach at night?  /
sd(^q)          A.23 utt3:  {C And } they said, no,  /
sd          A.23 utt4: it's very safe in the daytime -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  -- {C but } at night, they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens, pretty much telling people, be wary, {D you know, } and get off the beach. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  It's just so sad, {D you know, }  /
sv^r          B.26 utt2: it is just really so sad, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.26 utt3: it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.  /
sd          B.26 utt4:  {F Um, } in San Antonio I don't know what the answer is.  /
sv          B.26 utt5:  Education, I think, is a lot of it.  /
sd          B.26 utt6:  {F Um, } so  many of the kids are drop outs.  /
sd          B.26 utt7:  {F Um, } {F uh, } there's a lot of drugs that go on, and that they just have hopeless lives.  /
sd          B.26 utt8:  [ They, + they ] lead themselves down hopeless tunnels.  /
sv          B.26 utt9:  I think education helps a little bit there.  /
sv          B.26 utt10:  {F Um, } then again, I don't know really what steps there are that they, -/  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } [ what they, + what they ] say they try to do is to get the kids, {F um, } early and young. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {C And } what we have here in Burlington, which it doesn't cost a lot of money, but they have a kids council --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- that they have all these after school activities for kids. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  They set up kids with elderly people, in the winter time they shovel their snow.  /

sd          A.35 utt4: {C and } they have gyms open.  /
sd          A.35 utt5:  {C And } it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs --
