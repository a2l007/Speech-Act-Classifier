 o         A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
qo          A.1 utt2:  {D So, }  {F uh, } what do you think about it? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } I guess [ I, + I'm ] more concerned about public safety than I am about [ the, + {F um, } the ] concern  for the private, {F uh, } the idea of,   

^2          A.3 utt1:  Privacy. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  preserving privacy for,   

b          A.5 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  the individual, {F um, }  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C because } I can't really see why anyone, {F um, } who has nothing to hide would object. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } there is always [ the, + {F uh, } the ] possibility, even remote as it is,  [ [ of, + {F uh, } of ] mistaken, + {F uh, } of,  ] -/  

ba          B.8 utt1: [ That's, + of course, that is ] certainly true, /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  yeah. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C And } {D see } that bothers me.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: [ [ [ I'm, + I'm a, ] + {E I mean, } I'm, ] + I'm ] very much for drug testing, /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {F uh, } I really am.  /
cc          A.13 utt2:  {E I mean, } [ I'm going, + I'm going ] to take the negative side just for a second,   

b          B.14 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  just to do it.  /
sd         A.15 utt2:  {F Um, } {D see, } I have to take, {F uh, } medication [ [ for a, + {F uh, } for, ] + for ] kidney transplant. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {C And } I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life.  /
%          A.17 utt2:  {D Now, } you, -/  

b          B.18 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  I don't know how that's going to affect, {F uh, } /  

qy^d          B.20 utt1:  If you had to have a drug test? /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.23 utt1: {E I mean } I haven't had one yet.  /
%          A.23 utt2:  {F Um, } T I, - /
sd          A.23 utt3: I work for Texas Instruments -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.24 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] do have the random drug testing  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C but } I've missed it so far.  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C But } {E I mean, } [ it, + in the back of my mind, it ] always bothers me.  /
sd          A.25 utt4: {C And } what happens [ [ if it, + {D you know, } if it, ] + if they ] catch it,  /
sd          A.25 utt5: they think that [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm ] on drugs  /
sd          A.25 utt6: {C and } they send me [ and, + and ] have me, {F uh, } {D you know, } go through [ this, + this, ]    

^2          B.26 utt1:  Checked out or whatever. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  thing, {D you know,  }  /
b          A.27 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C But } it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that.  {F Um, }  /
sd          B.28 utt2: I agree [ that, + that ] some innocent person might be victimized,   

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  by a false test,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: {C but } I would think [ that, + {F um, } that ] some guidelines could be set up to avoid that.  /
sv          B.30 utt3:  For example, that one, {F uh, } positive would not be, {F uh, } accepted as an automatic, {F um, } reason for whatever they might be going,   

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  to do if they found a positive, {F uh, } dismissal or treatment or whatever,  {C but } [ that, + that ] what it would do is it would trigger, perhaps, {F uh, } one or two more stages where further tests could be [ ta-, + ] {F uh, } done. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C Because, } {F um, } [ there are, + there must ] be people like you, or in other circumstances, that could come up [ with, + with, ] {F uh, } false positives for certain kind of drugs.  /
sv          B.34 utt2:  On the other hand, {F um, } I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested --   

b          A.35 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  -- because [ of the, + of their ] responsibility for the public welfare,  and  certainly people in, {F uh, } industries, {D well, } the transportation industry,   

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.38 utt1:  [ for  spe-, + {F uh, } {D you know, } specifically. ] /  

b          A.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {C But, }  {F um, } in [ many, + many ] cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going to effect anybody but [ his, + {F uh, } {D you know, } himself ] and his own family, perhaps, {F um, } depending on the kind of drug he might be on. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C But, }  {F um, } {C and } eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works,   

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  and so on.  /
sv          B.44 utt2:  {C But } there's so many things that it would make a difference.  /
sd         B.44 utt3: I guess [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] would not want to have anyone in my family, {F uh, } victimized by [ someone who, + {D you know, }  [ a, + a ] bus driver or a train engineer or something like that, who,  ] {F um, } {D you know, } hadn't been tested. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.45 utt2:  {D Well, }  [ [ I, + {D you know, } I'm, ] + {D like } I said, [ I'm,  + I'm  ] ] very much pro testing, {F um, }  /
sd          A.45 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] this is why. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {F Uh, } number one is [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] kind of, - /
sd          A.47 utt2: I know this sounds like a slogan for the government,  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C but }  [ I, + {D you know, } we  ] are in a war against,   

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  drugs.  /
sv          A.49 utt2:  {E I mean } --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- [ it's, + it's ] horrible.  /
sv          A.51 utt2:  {E I mean, } you don't know whether the person sitting next to you --   

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  -- anywhere is on drugs or not, /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  {C and } it takes some drastic steps at this point.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:  {C And } I think, personally, the drastic step has to be [ that, + {F um, } that ] you can't work if you continue taking drugs. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:   {E I mean, } it's as simple as that.  /
sv          A.57 utt2:  {E I mean, } [ [ make it so, +    

^2          B.58 utt1:  Make it difficult enough. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  {D Well, } make it, ] + {F uh, } ma-, ] not necessarily difficult,  /
sv          A.59 utt2: {C but } make it so that it's not glamorous. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.60 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  {E I mean, } it's glamorous taking drugs,  /
sv          A.61 utt2: {C or } at least it seems that way. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah,  /
^2          B.62 utt2: according to what [ you, +   

aa          A.63 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.64 utt1:  you ] hear.  /
sv          B.64 utt2:  The people who, {F um, } have serious problems, {E I mean, } - /
%          B.64 utt3: we have, {F um, } - /
sv          B.64 utt4: {D really } I guess we're kind of lucky.  /
sd          B.64 utt5:  We really only know of one, {F uh, } young man [ who, + {F uh, } who's ] a fam-, - /
sd          B.64 utt6: they go to our church, /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {C and } it's the son and so on,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C and } he was friends with my children <swallowing> {F um, }  /
sd          B.66 utt3: {C and } he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up, {F um, } [ ha-, + having ] been involved with drugs.  /
sd          B.66 utt4:  {C But } I know of a number of other people who have, {D you know, } gotten all messed up. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  Most of these are young people.  /
sd          B.68 utt2:  I work in the education system  /
sd          B.68 utt3: {C and so } I have a little more contact with that.  /
sd          B.68 utt4: {C But, } {F um, } the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking -- /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv         B.70 utt1:  -- {C and } he may never really be a productive member of society.  /
sv          B.70 utt2:  {C But } sadder than that, he may never be able to have a normal, happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that [ are, + are ] almost uncontrollable.  /
sd          B.70 utt3: {E I mean, } [ he, + he ] puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that, {D you know, } [ he, + he's ] not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Huh. /  

sv          B.72 utt1:  {E I mean, } [ he's, + {D you know, } he's ] so messed up. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.74 utt1:  {C And, }  {F um, } this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.74 utt2: {C and } he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, {F um, } just got really down the wrong path. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } I don't know [ that, + that ] his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing.  /
sd          B.76 utt2:  {C But } seeing what drugs did to him [ makes me see, + makes me realize ] what it could do to people, {D you know, } in the work force as well. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.78 utt1:  {F Um, } it's horrible. /  

%          A.79 utt1:  {D Well, } then, - /
ad^t          A.79 utt2: [ let's, + let's ] answer the second half of the question.  /
qw^t          A.79 utt3:  What limits ought to be put on it, do you think? /  

sv          B.80 utt1:  {D Well, } the limits, {F uh, } {F uh, } would, I think, have to do with what I'd alluded to before, [ that there needs to be a further, + {F um, } [ that, + that ] one positive ] on a drug test,   

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  would not constitute, {F uh, } dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, {F uh, } have set up for those who genuinely have a problem. /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.84 utt1:  In other words, there needs to be, {F um, } more than, -/  

^2          A.85 utt1:  Treatment before for dismissal type thing. /  

 %         B.86 utt1:  Pard-, - /
 aa         B.86 utt2: yes,  /
b          B.86 utt3: right, /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.88 utt1:  there needs to be more than one test,  /
sv          B.88 utt2: {C and } there needs to be [ some, + some ] measure of, {F uh, } certainty before anything drastic happens. /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.90 utt1:  There are lots of things that are involved there, {F um, } such as, perhaps, [ insurance -- +   

b          A.91 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.92 utt1:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } denial of insurance ] for someone, {F um, }  /
sv          B.92 utt2: {C and } undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this, {F um, } [ that would, + that,  ] {D you know, } - /
sv          B.92 utt3: it would be unfair,  /
sv          B.92 utt4: {C and } people who are on medication, for example, or, {F um, } even  people who might be of the gay community, - /
sv          B.92 utt5: {C and } I'm not an advocate for that particular <laughter> segment of society,  /
sv          B.92 utt6: {C but, }  {F um, } I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination --   

b          A.93 utt1:  Right. /  

+@          B.94 utt1:  --  /
sv          B.94 utt2: {C because } it makes a bigger problem.  {F Um, }  /
sv          B.94 utt3: {C so } it seems to me [ that, + that, ] {F um, } there needs to be [ some ground, + {D you know, } some rules ] --   

b          A.95 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.96 utt1:  -- that protect.  /
sv          B.96 utt2:  I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if any, that we should say, {D well, } certain segments should not have to be tested.  /
sd          B.96 utt3: I really don't see why, /  

sd          A.97 utt1:  Personally, I think that's what I was about to say --   

b          B.98 utt1:  {C And, }  yeah. /  

+          A.99 utt1:  -- is that everyone needs to be tested. /  

b          B.100 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.100 utt2:  [ I don't, +    

%          A.101 utt1:  It, {D you know, } -/  

+          B.102 utt1:  I don't  ] know why it would be, {D you know, } {F uh, } bad to test just every-,  /
sv          B.102 utt2: {C and } it may be, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.102 utt3: it's not feasible to do everyone,  /
sv          B.102 utt4: {C but } certainly random testing, the fact that people know [ that, + that ] they, -/  

^2          A.103 utt1:  That it could happen. /  

aa          B.104 utt1:  Yeah, /  

b          A.105 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.106 utt1:  would be some measure of protection. - /
sv          B.106 utt2: {C But } the bottom line is [ that, + that ] [  if, +  if ] you're going to stay clean and straight, <laughter> then, {F um, } [ you're, + you're ] going to do that because you want to. /  

b          A.107 utt1:  Right. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  Really. /  

sv          A.109 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ there's, + {D yeah, } there, ] + there's ] going to be some measure of incentive, {F uh, } reward or whatever,  /
sv          A.109 utt2: {C but } the reward ultimately comes down to what you want. /  

b          B.110 utt1:  Yeah. /  

aa          A.111 utt1:  {C So } [ I, + I've ] got to agree with that. /  

x          B.112 utt1:  <Cough>.   

%          A.113 utt1:  {D So, }  {F um, } -/  

ba          B.114 utt1:  That's very true. /  

%          A.115 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          B.116 utt1:  {D Well, } it sounds like we agree, anyway. /  

aa          A.117 utt1:  Yeah,  /
