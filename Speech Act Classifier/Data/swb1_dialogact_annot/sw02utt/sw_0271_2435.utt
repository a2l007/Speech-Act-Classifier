sd          B.2 utt2: {D well, } the last movie I saw,  but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie <laughter>. /  

qy^d          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter> Obviously you have kids. /  

na          B.4 utt1:  <Laughter> That's right.  /
b          B.4 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C but } my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  I haven't seen that one yet. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  That's an excellent movie. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {F Um, } the last movie I saw was, {F uh, } SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } was that good.  /

sd          A.9 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D see, } I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C But } [ I was a lot, + I was a lot ] more impressed with her than I thought I would be. /  

ba          B.12 utt1:  {D Well, } that's good. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: it was a pretty good movie. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat. /  

sd          A.17 utt1: [ I, + I'm ] ready to go.  /
%          A.17 utt2:  It just, - /

b          B.18 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  {D You know, } [ it's, + {F uh, } it ] looks good, {D you know } --   

aa          B.20 utt1:  Yeah,  /

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C And } I do. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.  /
%          A.25 utt2:  {C So } <laughter>, -/  

b          B.26 utt1:  <Laughter> Really.  /

sd          B.28 utt2: {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] like all ranges of movies,  /
sd          B.28 utt3: <ringing> {C but } I like that where they run tense. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  I really enjoy, - /
sd          B.30 utt2: they keep me guessing the whole time.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: [  It's really, + it was really ] interesting. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qw          A.31 utt2:  {D Well, } what other movies have you seen then lately? /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  Other than the, - /
sd          A.33 utt2: I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          B.34 utt2: the new one, of course <laughter>. /  

qy^d          A.35 utt1:  Is that any good,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {E I mean, } I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Oh <<sound drawn out>>. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {C So } I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon. /  

b^m          B.38 utt1:  Amarillo.  /
sd          B.38 utt2: I didn't see the first one.  /
sd          B.38 utt3: My husband said it was, {F um, } about the same lines. /  

ba          A.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D well, } then it won't be too bad. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  {C So, }  yeah. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {D You know, } it wasn't impressive necessarily,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: {C but } it was better than it could have been. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          B.42 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.42 utt3:  {C And } I was impressed with the fact that, {F um, } it wasn't that childish. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qh          B.44 utt1:  You know what I mean.  /
%          B.44 utt2:  It wasn't, - /
sd          B.44 utt3: my daughter's five,  /
sd          B.44 utt4: {E I mean } she understood everything.  /
sd          B.44 utt5: She goes to almost all movies with us except, {D you know, } R rated.  /
sd          B.44 utt6: {C And } she really enjoyed it,  /
sd          B.44 utt7: {C but } it was on a higher level, {D you know, } where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did,  /
sd          B.44 utt8: {C and } I liked that. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: I think that's important  if [ [ [ you're going, + {D you know, } if you're going, ] +  {F uh, } kids are going to, ] +  {F uh, } parents are going ] to have to go --   

b          B.46 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  -- you ought to make it at least [ semi-, +   

x          B.48 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.49 utt1:  {D you know, } semi ] for them too. /  

ba          B.50 utt1:  That's right,  /
ba^r          B.50 utt2: that's right. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  It's pretty good.  /
sd          B.52 utt2:  {C But } we take her to just about every movie,  /
sd          B.52 utt3: {C and, } [ she, + {F uh, } she ] does really good.  /
sd          B.52 utt4:  We've taken her from real young,  /
sd          B.52 utt5: {C and } she does real good.  /
sd          B.52 utt6:  Like I said, we don't take her to R -s. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C So, }  if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  {F Oh, } no,  /
aa^r          B.56 utt2: no. /  

qy          A.57 utt1: [ Do you take her, + {E or } do you go ] to a lot of comedy movies  /
%          A.57 utt2: {C or } to, -/  

ny          B.58 utt1:   Yeah,  /
ny^r          B.58 utt2: yeah. /  

qw          A.59 utt1:  What was the last comedy you saw? /  

t1          B.60 utt1:  <Whispering> <<sort of to herself>> {F Oh } gosh what was the last comedy we saw?  /
^h          B.60 utt2: <<back to regular speech>> {F Huh, }  {F huh, }  {F huh. }  Good question,  /
^h^r          B.60 utt3: <laughter> good question.  /
sd          B.60 utt4:  We don't get to go that often,  /
^h          B.60 utt5: {C but } something on the tip of my tongue,  /
^h          B.60 utt6: {C and } I can't think of which one it was.  /
sd          B.60 utt7:  {F Uh. }  Gosh, I can't remember. /  

%          A.61 utt1:  The last, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.61 utt2: in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw -- /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  -- I said that wrong,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox. /  

ba          B.64 utt1:  {C But } [ that, + that ] sounds good. /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  {D Well, } that really wasn't too bad.  /
%          A.65 utt2:  There were, - /
sd          A.65 utt3: {D you know, } he's supposed, - /
sd          A.65 utt4: {D you know, } he's this actor, right -- /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  -- {C and } he's playing a cop. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Right. /  

 sd         A.69 utt1:  {C Or } he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop. /  

b          B.70 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          A.71 utt1:  {E I mean, } [ there, + there ] were times when [ he was, + {D like, }  he'd ] be running with a gun or whatever.  /
sd          A.71 utt2:  He didn't look like a cop when he did it.  /
sd          A.71 utt3:  {C And } I was so --   

 ba         B.72 utt1:  That's neat. /  

+          A.73 utt1:  -- impressed with that because, {D you know, } usually, -/  

^2          B.74 utt1:  The part was hard, to do that. /  

aa          A.75 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah,  /
sd          A.75 utt2: because, {E I mean, } everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying [ to, + {D you know, } to  ] imitate them or whatever. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I thought he did such an excellent job of not --   

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah, /  

+          A.79 utt1:  -- going that far.  /
sd          A.79 utt2:  {D Now, } by the end he was looking more like a cop.    

b          B.80 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.81 utt1:  {C But } at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, {D you know, } he was [ trying to, + trying to ] get it,  /
sd          A.81 utt2: {C but } he wasn't there yet. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.83 utt1:  {C And } you could tell it,  /
sv          A.83 utt2: {C and } I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, {D you know, } [ because I think, + ] or directing job.  /
sv          A.83 utt3:  I think they did a real good job of that. /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.85 utt1:  {C And } James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.  /
%          A.85 utt2:  {E I mean, } # {D you know, } he just, # -/  

 b         B.86 utt1:  # Yeah,  /

 b         A.87 utt1:  Yeah,  /
 sd         A.87 utt2: {C and } [ there were, + there were ] some definite, {F um, } should I say, tense moments,   

x          B.88 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

 +         A.89 utt1:  with him in there. /  

sd          B.90 utt1:  <Laughter> Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          A.91 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] had seen it before Christmas,  /
sd          A.91 utt3: {C but } I took a date to it, {F uh, } about a month ago.  /
sd          A.91 utt4:  {C So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I've ] seen it the second time not too long ago.  /

sv          B.92 utt1:  It was really cute. /  

sd          A.93 utt1:  I really enjoyed it. /  

x          B.94 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.95 utt1:  Of course, the bad thing about it was, {F uh, } the second time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it as much,  /
sd          A.95 utt2: {C and } I was kind of surprised at that.  /
sd          A.95 utt3:  I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over. /  

b          B.96 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.97 utt1:  {C But } before, - /
sd          A.97 utt2: maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time.  I had laughed so hard I was hoarse. /

b^r          B.98 utt2: uh-huh. /

b          B.100 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.101 utt1:  {C And } maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it,  /
sd          A.101 utt2: {E I mean, } it just wasn't as funny the second time --   

b          B.102 utt1:  Right. /
