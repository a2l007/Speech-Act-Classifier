============================================================================
  

o          A.1 utt1:  Okay, {F uh, }  /
^h          A.1 utt2: let's see,  /
sd          A.1 utt3: [ I, + I ] believe in the trial by jury.  /
sv          A.1 utt4:  I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, {F uh, } payoffs, {D you know, } briberies, {F uh, } <child> unfairness, one-sidedness, {D you know, } all those kinds of things.  /
sd          A.1 utt5:  {C And } I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.  /
sd          A.1 utt6: [ I, + I ] really agree with the, {F uh, } innocent until proven guilty theory.  /
sd          A.1 utt7:  I think [ that's, + that's ] a good way to do it. <smack> <talking>  /
sd          A.1 utt8: That's about all. /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I think, + I think ] basically <talking> we're <talking> in a lot of agreement, {F uh, } in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, {F uh, } some kind of legal definition. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {C But } for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be mandatory. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh <talking>. /  

 sv         B.6 utt1:  {C But } there should be with our overworked, {F uh, } judicial system, - /
sv          B.6 utt2:  it seems to me like there ought to be a means [ of, + of, ] {F um, } not having to take everything before a <child_talking> full court.  {D You know, }  /
sv          B.6 utt3: maybe there ought to be some kind [ of, + of, ] {F uh, }  ((   )) - /
qy^d          B.6 utt4: isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          A.7 utt2:  Really. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {C And } maybe instead [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } <child_talking> just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit to spend a week,  /
sv          B.8 utt2: {C and } during that week you're kind of an ad hoc,   {A let's hear about it, }  group of, I don't know, twenty-five instead of twelve -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  -- {C and } each case is presented to that group of twenty-five,  /
sv          B.10 utt2: {C and } those cases are, {F uh, } lesser degrees of magnitude.   {D You know, }  /
sd          B.10 utt3: the guy was caught burgling,  /
sd          B.10 utt4: {C and } he had his pockets full of stuff, {D you know, } when he was caught -- /  

b          A.11 utt1:  <Laughter>  Right. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  -- {D you know, } that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say, your pleasure your honor,  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {C and } there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  {C But } the way [ our system, + our court system ] works, that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  I just think our system is overworked,  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C and } we're starting to stretch the true meaning [ of, + of ] right to a speedy trial. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.17 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] a good idea.  /
sv          A.17 utt3:  Maybe this pre group of people could decide, {D you know, } [ which kind of, + {F uh, } {D you know, } where they could go ] from there.  /
sv          A.17 utt4: Do they need a big lengthy twelve person [ ju-, + jury ]  /
sv          A.17 utt5: {C or } do they need a six person jury  or, {D you know, } those kinds of things <talking>  /
sv          A.17 utt6: {C and } the degree [  of the, + of [ the, + {D you know, } the ] ] seriousness of it, {D you know, }  /

sv          A.17 utt8: is this open and  shut, {D you know, }  like you were saying,  /

sv          B.20 utt1:  {D You know, } kind of  ((   ))  off what we've been talking about here, {F uh, }  I believe  that [ our, + ] we've become almost a litigious society where [ we, + everyone ] is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff,  /

b          A.23 utt1:  <Laughter>  Uh-huh. /  

 sv         B.24 utt1:  {D You know, } maybe, instead of being so quick to sue you, {F uh, }  if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, [ maybe you + [ nee-, + ] maybe you, ] - /
