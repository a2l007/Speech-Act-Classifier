sd          B.16 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } I first started camping out in the desert in California.    

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  And then sometimes in the mountains also in California  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } then I moved to North Carolina  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C and } [ I, + I ] didn't camp for a long time,  /
sd          B.18 utt4:   {C and then } I started to, {F uh, } go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting,  /
sd          B.18 utt5: {C so, }  I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         B.20 utt1:  {C And then } maybe camp another night and drive home.  /
sd          B.20 utt2:  {C And } [ that was, + {F uh, } that was ] pretty good  /
sd          B.20 utt3: {C so, }  I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear  /
sd          B.20 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I still do it once in a while. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: I think we've collected stuff off and on over the years.  /
sd          A.21 utt3:  The more times we did it, the more serious we get about it. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          B.22 utt2:  Yeah. /  

qw          A.23 utt1: [ Where, + where ] is Raleigh, in North Carolina? /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D well, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + {F uh, } in terms of north, south I would say it's,  ] {F uh, } [ a little, + a little ] more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of  it. /  

bk          A.25 utt1:  Okay. /  

%          B.26 utt1:  {C So } what i-, -/  

qy          A.27 utt1:   (( Are ))  you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains, /

+          B.30 utt1:  it's, ] {F uh, } - /
sd          B.30 utt2: actually [ the, + the ] Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: They're about three hours away if you go due north. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.32 utt1:  {F Um, }  (( of )) - /
sd          B.32 utt2: the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer  /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C and } you can pick those up going west,  /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C but } then you're talking about six to eight hours. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  The way it works.  /
sd          B.34 utt2:  {C But, }  {F um, } [ it's a real, + it's a real ] nice place to go and  camp,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } there's some pretty decent campgrounds  (( although )) , [ I don't think Raleigh, + I don't think the state ] of North Carolina takes, - /
sv          B.34 utt4: they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          A.35 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: my wife's from the western part of Virginia,  /

sd          A.35 utt5: {C but } I didn't know [ how much, + how much ] camping areas there were along there. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I think there's quite a few.  /
sd          B.36 utt2: I can't say I've checked them all out though. /  

qo          A.37 utt1:  [ What, + what's ] it like camping in the desert and California,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: that seems,   

sd          B.38 utt1: [ It's, + {F uh, }   

+          A.39 utt1:  like a challenge. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  it's ] {D actually } kind of incredible,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: it's really, really nice.  /
sd          B.40 utt3:  {F Um, } I like  it better than almost anything I've ever done.  /
sd          B.40 utt4: Just the sky is so amazing.  /
sd          B.40 utt5: {D You know, } you really can probably count thousands of stars, /  

 b         A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         B.42 utt1:  {C and, }  {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] just kind of nice.  /
sd          B.42 utt2:  I like the, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.42 utt3: I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, {F uh, } a lot of people don't realize,  /
sd          B.42 utt4: {D you know, } they hear desert  /
sd          B.42 utt5: {C and } they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and  being real dry, and lack of water,  /
sd          B.42 utt6: course it, it has all of those qualities  /
sd          B.42 utt7: {C but } it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {C So, }  it's pretty nice.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: [  The, + {F uh, } the ] movie, THE DOORS, has [ so-, + some ] nice desert scenes,  /
sd          B.44 utt3: those guys all go camping out in the desert. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C but, }  {F um, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] shots [ are, + are ] pretty nice  /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C and } it's sort of like that, - /
sd          B.46 utt4: {E I mean, } it's just almost surreal, in some places. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  It's very pleasant. /

sd          B.56 utt1:  {E I mean, } it's just beautiful.  /
sd          B.56 utt2:  The days, get up into the high eighties, {F uh, } maybe the nineties  /
sd          B.56 utt3: {C but } [ it's, + it's ] quite bearable  /
sd          B.56 utt4: {C and then } the nights are reasonably warm, {D you know, } sixties or seventies.  /
sd          B.56 utt5:  It's just great.  /
sd          B.56 utt6: It's really very nice. /

sd          B.58 utt5:  A lot of people like to go down and camp down inside,  /
sd          B.58 utt6: I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking,    

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
