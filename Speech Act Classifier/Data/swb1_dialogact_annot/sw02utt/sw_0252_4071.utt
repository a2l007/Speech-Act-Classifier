sv          A.27 utt2: {C and } that is that money tends to stick where it lands first  /
sv          A.27 utt3: {C and } when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, {F uh, } a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you. /

b          B.38 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {F Uh, } there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax.  {F Uh, } ten percent or thirteen percent.  /

sd          A.41 utt3: {C and } you would just pay a flat tax.   No exemptions, no deductions or  anything else [ after + {D you know, } after ] you figure up who's in your family. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.42 utt2:  Huh. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  {C And } that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S  /
