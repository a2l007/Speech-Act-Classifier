ad          A.1 utt1:  Think about, {F uh, } taxes. /  

sv          @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I think they're a necessary evil.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2:  {F Uh, } I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, {F uh, } businesses operate on  /
sv          @B.2 utt3: {C and } that is, {F uh } --   

^2          A.3 utt1:  You spend what you have  /
%          A.3 utt2: {C and,  } -/  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- [ you, + you ] don't spend more [ than you, + than you ] bring in. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah,  /
 sv         A.5 utt2: I think that, the general idea is to [ s-, + {D you know, } spend, ] {F uh, } during a time of recession [ that, + ] {D you know, } for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy,  /
sv          A.5 utt3: {C but } they're running under the assump-, - /
sv          A.5 utt4: {D you know, } the way they're running it now, they're [ h-, + ] {D you know, } running  (( it under ))  a deficit spending, {D you know, } while we're not under a recession,  /
sv          A.5 utt5: {C so } there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running,  /
sv          A.5 utt6: {C so } that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, <breathing> keep spending, keep going into debt,  /
sv          A.5 utt7: you're not going to payoff what you owe,  /
sd^t         A.5 utt8: [ {C but, } + <sniffing> {C so, } ] I guess [ the, + the  ] question was more like, {F uh, } do you [ get  what you pay f-, + {D you know, } get what you pay for. ] /  

%          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } I, - /
sd          B.6 utt2: <breathing> it just depends.  /
sd          B.6 utt3: {F Uh, } {F uh, } roads are very expensive, {F uh, } commodity and so is, {F uh, } utilities they supply and police and fire department, {F uh, }  /
sv          B.6 utt4: {D you know, } they need to make a living. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.7 utt2:  <laughter>  There's, -/  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {C So } <laughter>, I think [ [ for, + for, ] + for ] many years, {F uh, } we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, {F uh, } to a great extent, public servants --   

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1:  -- {F uh, } we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society. /  

ba          A.11 utt1:  I agree with that. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } then again, {F uh, } it's [ the, + ] hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  I guess, - /
sd          A.13 utt2: [ I'm, + I'm ] a student right now  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and } I don't make a whole lot of money  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C and, so, } [ I, + I ] kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes [ to, + ] I guess, {F uh, } compared to what I get, because [ I, + ] {D you know, } all [ my, + my ] education is state sponsored.  /
sd          A.13 utt5: I go to a state sponsored school  /
sd          A.13 utt6: {C and, }  {F uh, } my education all up through high school and stuff, - /
sd          A.13 utt7: {C so } I guess I'm kind of in debt, [ I, + I ] suppose, because I don't, {D you know, } been paying taxes [ all that, + all that ] long.  /
sd          A.13 utt8:  My parents, I guess, [ [ h-, + h-, ] + however, ] have contributed to that, {D you know, } for the education side of it and everything,  /
sd          A.13 utt9: {C but, }  {F uh, } I usually end up getting money back.  /

sd          A.17 utt1:  I need it, too,  /
%          A.17 utt2: otherwise, -/  

sd          B.18 utt1:  We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {F uh, } we pay in a substantial amount.  {F Uh, } /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  We don't regret paying taxes.  /
sv          B.20 utt2:  We do think that, {F uh, } sometimes, {F uh, } we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {C And } progressive tax, I think, {F uh, } does not give people incentive to make more money,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {C and } what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more # tax you pay. # /  

^2          A.23 utt1:  # More taxes you pay. # /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  It should be, I think, a flat percentage  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } that percentage ought to be an equitable amount. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          A.25 utt2:  Isn't, -/  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } last year when they passed the tax laws for the, {F uh, } nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- {F uh, } I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and --   

b         A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- everything else,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C and } I totaled them all up  /
sd          B.30 utt3: {C and } basically, {F uh, } we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax. /  

ba          A.31 utt1:  Wow. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {D Now, } that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar [ for every, + for every ] item on there --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  -- even though there's, {F uh, } taxes on different things. /  

%          A.35 utt1:  {D Well } isn't, -/  

sv          B.36 utt1:  {C But, } {D you know, } [ there's f-, + there's ] a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.36 utt2: like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: there's a [ lot, + {D yeah, } lot ] of hidden taxes. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into [ your, + your ] --   

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  -- tank. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  The taxes that people don't think about that, - /
%          A.41 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          A.41 utt3: [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C But } you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
%          A.43 utt2:  There was that, -/

sd          A.45 utt2: was it Jerry Brown,  /
sd          A.45 utt3: one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all [ the, + the ] tax codes they have now and  implementing [ a f-, + I think a flat ] percentage, something like that. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah <<faint>>,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: if you [ impl-, + implemented ] a flat percentage, it would encourage people, {F uh, } to make more money  /
sv          B.46 utt3: {C and } [ the, + ] what people need to understand in my opinion, {A now this is just my opinion, okay, } {F uh, } is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv(^q)          B.48 utt1:  {C And, so, } if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder --   

b          A.49 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- and make any more or create any more jobs. /  

ba          A.51 utt1:  Exactly.  /
