o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

o          B.2 utt1:  All right.  /
qy          B.2 utt2:  {F Uh, } do you have any friends that have children? /  

na          A.3 utt1:  I do have friends that have children,  /
ny          A.3 utt2: yes. /  

qw          B.4 utt1:  {C And } what do they say about finding adequate child care? /

sv          B.6 utt1:  I think that may be the key word. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  I think that's correct.  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  There, {F uh, } relatively nonexistent [ from, + {F uh, } from ]  what I hear from my friends.  /
sd          A.7 utt3:  It seems like, {F uh, } even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word --    

b          B.8 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.9 utt1:  -- {F uh, } still you have to deal with the people that, {D you know, } happen to be operating it locally  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } it's just a matter [ of, + of ] trust, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.9 utt3: I think they feel that these people are, {F um, } under qualified basically and  underpaid,  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } I think that sort of goes hand in hand  /
sd          A.9 utt5: {C so } [ it's, + it's ] difficult for them. /

sd          B.14 utt1:  {C And } we moved away from institutionalized child care --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Huh-uh. /

b^r          A.21 utt2:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {F Uh, } at one point in time we've had au pairs,

b          A.33 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  I do have a friend that, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sd          A.33 utt3: she and her roommate became live-in care givers  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C and } they loved it.  /
sd          A.33 utt5:  They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small, {D you know, } four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school.  /
sd          A.33 utt6:  {C And, }  {F uh, } she was paid very well because [ they, + ] the parents trusted them  /
sd          A.33 utt7: {C and } they, {D you know, } had done such a good job.  /
sd          A.33 utt8: {C So, }  {F um, } I can see where someone, {D you know, } in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if [ you're, + you're ] lucky enough to have the financial  ((   ))  to be able to do that. /  

ba          B.34 utt1:  {D Well, } that's true, /

sd          A.37 utt2:  I think it's just a matter of priorities.  /
sv          A.37 utt3: [ It's, + {F uh, } {D you know, } it's ] a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way,  /

b^r          A.43 utt2: Yeah.  /
sv          A.43 utt3:  {C And } [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] bad to have to admit, too,  /
sv          A.43 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home  /
sv          A.43 utt5: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children.  /
%          A.43 utt6: I, - /
sd          A.43 utt7: it's just such a responsibility [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] when I've had friends that have said, - /

sd          A.43 utt9: I realize that's true  /
sd          A.43 utt10: {C so } it's, {F uh, } such a responsibility. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } it certainly is.  {F Uh, }  /

sv          A.51 utt2: Most of the time <laughter>. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  {D Well, } I just have to be honest about it.  /
sd          B.52 utt2:  It's not always,   

b          A.53 utt1:  # Yeah.  /

b^r          A.55 utt3:  Sure. /  

sd(^q)          B.56 utt1:  There are those times when I think, {D gee, } if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf. /

sd          A.57 utt5:  {C But, } {D you know, } it's funny.  /
sd          A.57 utt6:  [ I did, + I had ] a friend that  said, {D you know, } before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other  /

sv          A.57 utt10: [ it's, + it's ] just the way your attitude changes  /
sv          A.57 utt11: {C and } you mature I suppose.  /
sd          A.57 utt12:  {C But } the thing about the child care [ I, + {D you know, } I ] have friends that struggle financially [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they both do have to work.  /
sd          A.57 utt13:  It's a matter not necessarily, {F uh, } that she might want to stay home or he, as well,  /
sd          A.57 utt14: {C but, } {D you know, } they need the money.  /
sd          A.57 utt15:  {C And, }  {F uh, } when I seen some of my friends that  have taken that six week old baby, {D you know, } to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be.
