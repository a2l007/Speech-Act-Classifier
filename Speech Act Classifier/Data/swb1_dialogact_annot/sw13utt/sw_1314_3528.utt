%          B.58 utt1: {D So } [ it's, + this book was ] interesting, though.  /
sv          B.58 utt2:  I, {F uh, } - /

sd          B.66 utt1: {C But } they have to come in at [ a, + ] just the right angle.  /
sd          B.66 utt2: If you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space -- /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh.   /  

sd          B.68 utt1: -- {C and } if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up. /
