sv          B.1 utt1:  Gun control seems to be a rather, {F uh,} timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise. /  

aa          A.2 utt1:  Yes <laughter>. /  

sd          B.3 utt1: {C And,} {F uh,} [the, + the] interesting scale that they assigned it, {F uh,} the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free  <breathing>.  /
sv          B.3 utt2:  I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.  /
sv          B.3 utt3: [I, + I] don't mind regulating [all of the, + the] guns  /
sv          B.3 utt4: {C and} I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.  /
sv          B.3 utt5: {D Now} [the, + the] wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.  /
sv          B.3 utt6:  {F Uh,} the method [of, + of] controlling it, {D well} that's all into how much money you want to put into [the, + the] controls.  /
sd          B.3 utt7:  {F Uh,} one point that was made in the <breathing> House hearings - /
%          B.3 utt8: {C or} - /
sd(^q)          B.3 utt9: the representative stood up and said, {D you know,} we can check a guy's credit card instantly,  /
^q          B.3 utt10: {C but,} {F uh,} we don't want to check his background,  /
sv          B.3 utt11: {C and} of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes -- /  

b          A.4 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.5 utt1:  -- {F uh,} - /
sd          B.5 utt2: {C but} there still, [the, + the] technology exists [to, + to] check it if they want.  /
%          B.5 utt3: {C So,} [it's, + it's] kind of a, <breathing> - /
sv          B.5 utt4: I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.  /
sd          B.5 utt5:  {C And then} you've got the group of people that decide that [there's, + there's] no particular reason to have them at all  /
sv          B.5 utt6: {C and} you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it  /
sv          B.5 utt7: {C and} I guess I would fall more in [the, + the] realm that I like the sport issue of it,  /
sd          B.5 utt8: {C but} [I, + I] could give it up without too much trouble,  /
sv          B.5 utt9: not the world's most pleasurable thing  /
sv          B.5 utt10: {C and} it costs a bit to do [it, +    

b          A.6 utt1:  Yes <laughter>. /  

+          B.7 utt1:  {F uh,} finding ranges and things like that.] /  

b          A.8 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.9 utt1:  {F Uh,} I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,  /
sv          B.9 utt2: {C but} it's just not like golf or whatever.  /
sv          B.9 utt3:  {E I mean} there are other things that you could go do.  /
sv          B.9 utt4: {D So,} {F uh,} [I, + I] don't see [the, + the] joy of shooting [as, + as] that much of a driving factor.  /
sv          B.9 utt5:  I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt, /  

b          A.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.11 utt1:  I don't even keep the gun in our house, /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.13 utt1:  {C so} I don't have that problem,  /
%          B.13 utt2: {C but,} {F uh,} <breathing> - /
sv          B.13 utt3: it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.  /
sv          B.13 utt4:  A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it. /  

aa          A.14 utt1:  They do,  /
sd          A.14 utt2: {C and} [you, + boy you] can get them on either side  /
sd          A.14 utt3: {C and} just like you say,  /
sv          A.14 utt4: {F uh,} {D well} [[I think + [I, + I guess] I'd have to place myself, {F uh,} probably seven or eight <laughter>,  /

sd          A.14 utt9: {F uh,} two or three. -/  

b          B.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.16 utt1:  I was going the wrong direction.  /
sd          A.16 utt2:  {F Uh,} {C because of,} we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child --   

ba@          B.17 utt1:  Uh-huh.     

+          A.18 utt1:  -- because they had a gun in the house  /
sd          A.18 utt2: {C and} the father kept the bullets in a separate place,  /
sd          A.18 utt3: {C but} the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,  /
sd          A.18 utt4: {F uh,} he knew where [booth, +  both] places were, loaded the gun  /
sd          A.18 utt5: {C and} they were playing cowboys and Indians  /
sd          A.18 utt6: {C and} he shot the other little boy right between the eyes. /  

+@          B.19 utt1:  Boy. /  

%          A.20 utt1:  {D So,} {F uh,} - /
sd          A.20 utt2: I mean it,  /
sd          A.20 utt3: it destroyed two families --    

b          B.21 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.22 utt1:  -- {F uh,} in just that instant  /
sv          A.22 utt2: [{C and,} + {C and}] [I, + a lot of people] say that they need it for protection, {F uh,}  /
sd          A.22 utt3: having worked at one time in Baltimore, - /
%         A.22 utt4: {C or,} - /
sd          A.22 utt5: I don't know if you're in the big city, /  

sd          B.23 utt1:  Dallas. /  

qy          A.24 utt1:  are you, - /
br^m          A.24 utt2: Dallas? /

b          B.27 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.28 utt1:  {F Uh,} then {D you know} that, {F uh,} {F uh,} - /
sv          A.28 utt2: if you live anywhere real close that, {F uh,} - /
%          A.28 utt3: the safety is, {F uh,} - /
sv          A.28 utt4: some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.  /
sd          A.28 utt5:  {C But,} {F uh,} {F uh,} we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up.  /
%          A.28 utt6:  {F Uh,} I, {F uh,} - /
sd          A.28 utt7: once, {F uh,} {F uh,} knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman  /
sd          A.28 utt8: {C and} he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,  /
sd          A.28 utt9: {C and} he's going to, {D you know,} try to shoot first. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.30 utt1:  {F Uh,} <laughter> {D so,} {D you know,} if he's got one.  /
sd          A.30 utt2:  {F Uh,} {C and} if not,  /

b          B.33 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.33 utt2:  About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that [the, + the,] person was coming your way.  /
sv          B.33 utt3:  Once you're surprised, it's too late. /  

aa          A.34 utt1:  That's right. /

sv          B.41 utt4: it's hard to know the original intent,  /
sv          B.41 utt5: {C but} [I, + I] don't see it as that, that difficult of a <breathing> story to believe when the opposition says that, {F uh,} {D yeah,} it's the right to, to arm a militia [and, + ] as opposed to just the general public. /  

b          A.42 utt1:  Right. /

sv          B.43 utt2: not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,  /

b          B.61 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.62 utt1:  {D So,} {F uh,} [I, + I] think they should have at least some control over, over those things.  /
