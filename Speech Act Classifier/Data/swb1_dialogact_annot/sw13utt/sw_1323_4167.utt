b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- you can tune into some stations  /
sd          B.30 utt2: and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.  /
sd          B.30 utt3:  Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area  /

sv          B.34 utt2:  Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.  /
sd          B.34 utt3:  I hadn't really thought about it  /
sv          B.34 utt4: but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          A.35 utt2:  Exactly.  /
aa          A.35 utt3:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.35 utt4:  I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.  /
sd          A.35 utt5:  Uh, well part of it, touring.  /
sv          A.35 utt6:  And, uh, you know, i-, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on.  /
sd          A.35 utt7:  There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years.    

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  You know, because of the problems with Quebec  /

ny          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  Or, or, i-, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of  /
sd          B.40 utt2: and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.  /
%         B.40 utt3:  And, and c-, came (( )), - /
sd         B.40 utt4: it was a big thing going on there  /
sd          B.40 utt5: and I came back here  /
sd          B.40 utt6: and nothing in the papers. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.41 utt2: right. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  I didn't see a thing about it.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess.  /
sv          B.42 utt3:  It's improved.  /
sd          B.42 utt4:  And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.  /
%          B.42 utt5:  Even, even there's, uh, uh, - /
sd          B.42 utt6: it's sor-, it's semireligious in some respects.  /
qw          B.42 utt7:  But what is it?  /
sd          B.42 utt8:  It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way, - /
sd          B.42 utt9: uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.  /
sd          B.42 utt10:  The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Oh, yeah. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  Uh, I, it surprised me.  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  I've caught it a few times  /
sd          B.44 utt3: and they, they do some pretty good news.  /
sd          B.44 utt4:  Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.  /
sv          B.44 utt5:  Uh --   

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.  /
sv          B.46 utt2:  You'd think it would carry mostly religious  /
sv          B.46 utt3: but it, it doesn't seem to.  /
sd          B.46 utt4:  So I'll flip through and <throat_clearing> listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.  /
sd          B.46 utt5:  Uh, some more in-, interest type topics in, in other countries.  /
sv          B.46 utt6:  But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.  /
