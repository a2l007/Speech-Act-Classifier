=========================================================================
  

sd          A.1 utt1:  Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: and I had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working,  /
sd          A.1 utt3: uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column -- /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  -- and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely,  /
sv          A.3 utt2: which is even worse than them just not getting bright <laughter>. /  

aa          B.4 utt1:  Exactly. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  And I had presumed that it was the switch,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: and, uh, this is, uh, an older car,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: it's a seventy-two M G,  /
sd          A.5 utt4: so I had to mail order the part, uh,  /
sd          A.5 utt5: which I had done,  /
sd          A.5 utt6: and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to discover that that apparently is not the problem,  /
sd          A.5 utt7: it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that, uh, you know, that they will accept it,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used. /  

qr          B.8 utt1:  Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed? /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  I talked to one mechanic about it,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: and he suspected the switch also.  /
%          A.11 utt4:  Uh, but I've not, you know, - /
sd          A.11 utt5: I really don't know what the problem might be.  /
sv          A.11 utt6:  It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard -- /  

b         B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  -- uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,  /
%          A.13 utt2: but, -/  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah, I know,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.  /
qy          B.14 utt3:  Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam --   

no          A.15 utt1:  I --   

+          B.16 utt1:  -- as opposed to your low beam? /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- I don't know,  /
sv          A.17 utt2: I should look at that.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram -- /  

^2          B.18 utt1:  Diagram. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  -- so I'll have to go back and look at that. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.  /
sd          B.20 utt3:  I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp -- /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd(^q)          B.22 utt1:  -- you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.23 utt2: that's a good idea. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  So, that's a possibility. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  What I've typically found when that, uh, - /
sv          A.25 utt2: companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: and I hope that that's the case this time. /  

qy          B.26 utt1:  Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports? /  

na          A.27 utt1:  Right,  /
na          A.27 utt2: exactly -- /  

%          B.28 utt1:  Who, -/  

sd          A.29 utt1:  -- it's out of Kansas --    

b          B.30 utt1:  Um -- /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- somewhere. /  

qy^d          B.32 utt1:  -- so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that. /  

nn          A.33 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.33 utt2: it's not.  /
sd          A.33 utt3:  I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car,  /
sd          A.33 utt4: but it is not either,  /
sd          A.33 utt5: it's obviously doesn't quite fit,  /
sd          A.33 utt6: so it must be for a different year,  /
sd          A.33 utt7: so I'll have to try to return that as well. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qy          B.34 utt2: have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the metroplex? /  

na          A.35 utt1:  Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: because I've owned this car since it was new,  /
%          A.35 utt3: and, uh, - /
sd          A.35 utt4: but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and --   

b          B.36 utt1:  Oh, yeah. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- Inwood area -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- and I hadn't used him for some years,  /
sd          A.39 utt2: and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized  /
sd          A.39 utt3: instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and {pause} German cars <laughter>. /  

ba          B.40 utt1:  I'll be darned. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  I'm not sure that he works on much else at all,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.  /
sd          A.41 utt3:  So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person,  /
sd          A.41 utt4: as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.  /
sd          A.41 utt5:  So, I'll, uh, I should be able to take it in and check that part out.  /
sd          A.41 utt6:  I've not had to exchange any other parts recently, because they were defective.  /
sd          A.41 utt7:  Now, I've had, had pretty good luck,  /
sd          A.41 utt8: I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  I purchased it at Sam's,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty,  /
sv          A.43 utt3: and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,  /
sd          A.43 utt4: because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole year go by.  /
sd          A.43 utt5:  Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play,  /
sd          A.43 utt6: and as it turned out, it had a full year's warranty,  /
sd          A.43 utt7: and I could have gotten it repaired for free  /
sd          A.43 utt8: but --   

ba          B.44 utt1:  Oh, my goodness. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- I had to take it in, /  

x          B.46 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two. /  

ba          B.48 utt1:  Oh, no. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  So I didn't even,  I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.  /
sd          A.49 utt2:  But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  Well, ours wasn't within the last year.  /
sd          B.50 utt2:  I guess it's been within the last two years, uh,  /
sd          B.50 utt3: Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new,  /
sd          B.50 utt4: and it's one with the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh, - /
sd          B.50 utt5: I don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort,  /
sd          B.50 utt6: and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two problems.  /
sd          B.50 utt7:  It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point that we park on a hill, under our car port,  /
sd          B.50 utt8: and, it, when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley,  /
sd          B.50 utt9: and knowing that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard,  /
sd          B.50 utt10: otherwise it would just wrench control away from you. /  

ba          A.51 utt1:  Good grief. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign -- /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  -- and the engine would just quit.   /  

x          A.55 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out,  /
sd          B.56 utt2: and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing,  /
sd          B.56 utt3: so they adjusted timing  /
sd          B.56 utt4: and the problem didn't go away,  /
sd          B.56 utt5: so we ended up taking it back again,  /
sd          B.56 utt6: and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around,  /
sd          B.56 utt7: but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever,  /
sd          B.56 utt8: and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error --   

b          A.57 utt1:  Huh. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  -- in the, uh, computer control unit,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part -- /  

ba          A.59 utt1:  My goodness. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  -- and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine --    

b          A.61 utt1:  Huh. /  

+          B.62 utt1:  -- for a considerable period of time,  /
sd          B.62 utt2: and now it seems to be, - /
sd          B.62 utt3: we don-, we're not experiencing the stalling,  /
sd          B.62 utt4: but we're still experiencing a very uneven, -/
