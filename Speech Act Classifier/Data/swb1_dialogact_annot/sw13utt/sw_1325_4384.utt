sd          A.1 utt2: I don't have any children  /
sd          A.1 utt3: but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school.  /
sd          A.1 utt4:  And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked.  /
%          A.1 utt5:  And I just, #uh# ... -/  

b          B.2 utt1:  #<talking> Yeah.#  /
sd         B.2 utt2: That's the only thing I've ever done also, #is baby-sit.# /  

qy          A.3 utt1:  #Is it?#  {Very faint}. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.  /
sv          B.4 utt2:  Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  Oh, yeah.  /

sd          A.11 utt2:  See the lady I did it for, - /
sd          A.11 utt3: that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.  /
sd          A.11 utt4:  So she could sleep in.  /
sd          A.11 utt5:  And, uh, then she could be at home  /
sd          A.11 utt6: and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.  /
sd          A.11 utt7:  But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour  /
sd          A.11 utt8: and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents  /
sd          A.11 utt9: and that wasn't counting food or --
