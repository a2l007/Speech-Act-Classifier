%          B.1 utt1:  [Clanking] {dishes} <talking> {woman and children} <music>. /  

sd          A.2 utt1:  Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something,  /
sd          A.2 utt2: I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door <laughter>. /  

qw          B.3 utt1:  <Laughter>  What kind of a car do you have now? /  

sd          A.4 utt1:  Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight,  /
sd          A.4 utt2: and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica. /  

b          B.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.6 utt1:  And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style. /  

b          B.7 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.8 utt1:  That same kind of four door, hard top style. /  

qy          B.9 utt1:  You got kids? /  

nn          A.10 utt1:  Uh, no  /
sd^e          A.10 utt2: but we're planning for it. /  

bk          B.11 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.12 utt1:  So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight  /
sd          A.12 utt2: but it's in pretty good sh-, in really good shape. /  

b          B.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.14 utt1:  And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles. /  

b^r          B.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.16 utt1:  So that's probably where the first place we'd look. /  

b          B.17 utt1:  Huh. /  

%          A.18 utt1:  But, uh, -/  

sd          B.19 utt1:  Well, we've always had, uh, Fords. /  

b          A.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.21 utt1:  Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership <laughter>. /  

ba          A.22 utt1:  That'll do it. /  

b          B.23 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd^m          B.23 utt2:  That'll do it.  /
sd          B.23 utt3:  Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape.  /
sv          B.23 utt4:  I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice --   

b          A.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.25 utt1:  -- and piano lessons,  /
sd          B.25 utt2: and we've got a minivan, /  

b          A.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.27 utt1:  and that's great.  /
%          B.27 utt2:  And I d-, drive, uh, - /
sd          B.27 utt3: well I used to drive an Escort,  /
sd          B.27 utt4: but it died on me. /  

x          A.28 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

sd          B.29 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day. /  

ba          A.30 utt1:  Oh, geez. /  

sd          B.31 utt1:  And, uh, and this Escort took it all.  /
sd          B.31 utt2:  And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it,  /
sd          B.31 utt3: and the engine just went. /  

b          A.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.33 utt1:  So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries,   

b          A.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.35 utt1:  which has been okay. /  

bh          A.36 utt1:  Really? /  

sd          B.37 utt1:  I, I mean I've haven't had it that long. /  

b          A.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.39 utt1:  But it, it al-, it's an eighty-five Aries,  /
sd          B.39 utt2: but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it. /  

ba          A.40 utt1:  Oh, geez. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:  And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.  /
sd          B.41 utt2:  So it's just a ten minute commute every day. /  

b          A.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.43 utt1:  So, uh, it <laughter> doesn't get much of, uh, - /
sv          B.43 utt2: I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces. /  

b          A.44 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.44 utt2: yeah. /  

%          B.45 utt1:  But I think, uh,  /
sv          B.45 utt2: and it's a four door which is nice, /  

b          A.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.47 utt1:  but it's still a little cramped.  /
sd          B.47 utt2:  I've got three kids, /  

b          A.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.49 utt1:  #so I, I,# -/

sd          A.54 utt5: They've been, uh, a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's.  /
sd          A.54 utt6:  That I guess it's the sports version --   

bh          B.55 utt1:  Oh, really? /

b          B.61 utt1:  Yeah. /

x          B.63 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

+          A.64 utt1:  and gun metal grey and those kind of colors.  /

b          B.65 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.66 utt1:  They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.  /

b          B.79 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.80 utt1:  And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire. /  

b          B.81 utt1:  #Oh.# /  

sd          A.82 utt1:  #And# I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a  two seater, uh, sports car. /  

b          B.83 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.84 utt1:  But that, that just does not make it as an only car. /  

x          B.85 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

sd          A.86 utt1:  It's, uh, it's like I, I would, - /
sd          A.86 utt2: I bought a set of stereo speakers -- /  

b          B.87 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.88 utt1:  -- and it was one of those cash and carry deals.  /

sv          B.99 utt3: you know, it's funny.  /

b          A.100 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.101 utt1:  or, you know, or when they were single anyway. /  

b          A.102 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.103 utt1:  They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.  /

sd          B.103 utt3:  Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla. /  

bh          A.104 utt1:  Oh, really? /

b          A.106 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.107 utt1:  -- and, uh, that was a great little car.  /
sd          B.107 utt2:  Actually I met, - /
sd          B.107 utt3: that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never, - /
sd          B.107 utt4: I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission.   

b          A.108 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.109 utt1:  And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car. /  

sv          A.110 utt1:  Boy, that's a good deal. /  

sd          B.111 utt1:  And, uh, in fact I married one of those people <Laughter>. /  

b          A.112 utt1:  Ah, okay.  /
sd          A.112 utt2:  Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in --

b          A.116 utt1:  Huh.  /
%          A.116 utt2:  Because I, I know we've, uh, - /
sd          A.116 utt3: that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission.  /
sd          A.116 utt4:  My, uh, my wife just does-, can't, can't, uh, - /
sv          A.116 utt5: she really doesn't want to learn I guess,   

b          B.117 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.117 utt2: yeah. /  

+          A.118 utt1:  the, uh, the standard shift.  /

sd          A.118 utt3:  We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll --   

b^r          B.119 utt1:  Yeah. /

b^r          B.121 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.122 utt1:  And we went, uh, <children> we went, uh, we went to a dealership  /
sd          A.122 utt2: and, uh, it, it was prev-, she, she did pretty well.  /
sd          A.122 utt3:  But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot -- /  

b^r          B.123 utt1:  Yeah <Laughter>. /  

sd          A.124 utt1:  -- and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking,  /
sd          A.124 utt2: because that was all it was.  /
sd          A.124 utt3:  It was, it was the funniest thing,  /
sd          A.124 utt4: it was like, uh,

b          B.131 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.132 utt1:  And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess. /  

b          B.133 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          A.134 utt1:  And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth.  /
sd          A.134 utt2:  She did pretty well after a while. /  

b          B.135 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.136 utt1:  But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess. /  

%          B.137 utt1:  Well, my wife, - /
sd          B.137 utt2: I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission. /
