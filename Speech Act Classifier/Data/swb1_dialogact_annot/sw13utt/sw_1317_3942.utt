sd          A.1 utt1: {D Well, } the topic's about government.   /

sv          B.2 utt1:  <Laughter> I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and --   

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah.   /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- {F uh, } how many people are self serving.  /

b^r          @A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh.   /  

+          B.10 utt1:  And that people aren't self serving.  /  

b^r          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {E I mean } that's what I would like to think.  /  

b          A.13 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.13 utt2: [[ I, + I, ] + I ] think that the last, {F uh, } part of that question was particularly interesting, {F uh, } about, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ can all unethical behavior, + {E or } how much unethical behavior can ] be made illegal --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /  

+          A.15 utt1: -- {F uh, } because [ i-, + it ] seems to me that when <breathing>, {F uh, } government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes --   

b^r          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh.   /  

+          A.17 utt1: -- {F uh, } parallel to the legal codes that, {F uh, } we're focusing on the wrong thing. /

sv          A.19 utt1: [ Maybe, + maybe ] that's what is happening.   /
sv          A.19 utt2: Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past, {D you know, } ten to twenty years --   

b          B.20 utt1:  ((Right)) <<faint>>. /  

+          A.21 utt1: -- that, {F uh, } it becomes more evident.   /
sv          A.21 utt2: Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or, {D you know, } et cetera like that -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.23 utt1: -- {C and } we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons. /  

b^r          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  {C And } I couldn't help thinking [ when that last quest-, + {A it was a funny question } --

b^r          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /  

+          A.29 utt1: -- [ that, + {F uh, } ] <breathing> how much, {F uh, } should it be our, {F uh, } prerogative to see into the private lives of these people.

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah.   /  

sv          B.38 utt1: {E I mean, } I guess in some cases, {D sure } we care about what they did in the past --  /

sv          B.42 utt1: -- I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {E I mean } just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician. /  

sv          A.43 utt1: [[ I, + I, ] + I ] agree with that [ and, + {F uh, } and ] also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by --   

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
