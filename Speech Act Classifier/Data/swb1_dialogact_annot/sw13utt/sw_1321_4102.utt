qo          A.1 utt1:  So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale? /  

sv          @B.2 utt1:  Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  They've got a lot of special needs  /
sv          B.4 utt2: and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  Right, /  

x          B.6 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  very definitely. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  And so you've got a real balance to make there. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qo          B.10 utt1:  What about you? /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  They aren't really that old,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: but they are, sort of wearing out.  /
sd          A.11 utt4: My mamma is a dialysis patient -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  -- and she is only about sixty-four,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: but she's had some pretty close calls  /
sd          A.13 utt3: and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now  /
sd          A.13 utt4: and so she's phasing out {sounds like}  /
sd          A.13 utt5: and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't  like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when  she wants to -- /  

b^r          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  -- uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: but my daddy keeps talking about it.  /
%          A.15 utt3:  I don't, - /
sd          A.15 utt4: I couldn't possibly,   

%          B.16 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> {very faint}. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  couldn't never see him in a nursing home. /  

x          B.18 utt1:  <Laughter>. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Oh really. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- and he's living by himself.  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  My grand mamma died a couple of years ago -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Oh, okay. /  

%          A.23 utt1:  -- so but, he's, you know, - /
sv          A.23 utt2: as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: but it gets hard.  /
sd          B.24 utt3:  My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties -- /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  -- and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease -- /  

b^r          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  -- so she doesn't remember anybody -- /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  -- and, uh, she remembers things,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: but they are things back whenever she was real young -- /  

b^r          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.32 utt1:  -- and so, with, - /
sd          B.32 utt2: she was living by herself  /
sd          B.32 utt3: but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her -- /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  -- and it's creating a lot of problems. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Right,  /
qy^d          A.35 utt2: especially for your uncle I bet. /  

ny          B.36 utt1:  Oh yes.  /
ny^r          B.36 utt2:  Yes. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.  /
qy          A.37 utt2: Do they have anything like that in Dallas. /  

^h          B.38 utt1:  In Dallas,  /
ny          B.38 utt2: uh, yeah.  /
sd          B.38 utt3:  I've, I've heard of several things  /
sv          B.38 utt4: and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,  /
sv          B.38 utt5: but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right.  /
bf            A.39 utt2:  So they are pretty limited. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  Oh, another interesting thing,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa-, well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives.    

b          B.42 utt1:  Oh really. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.46 utt2: uh-huh.  /
sv          B.46 utt3:  Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know  /
sv          B.46 utt4: and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,  /
sv          B.46 utt5: but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active --    

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh {very faint}. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- and their body just hasn't kept up with them -- -/  

b          A.49 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  -- and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, <noise> programs have left off <noise> -- /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  -- because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Right  /
sd          A.53 utt2: to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities. /  

b^r          B.54 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.54 utt2:  Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas.  /
sd          B.54 utt3: Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work --   

aa          A.55 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- and sports. /  

aa^r          A.57 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly, -/  

aa          A.59 utt1:  That's true.  /
bf          A.59 utt2:  You can't play those things. /  

aa          B.60 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.60 utt2: you can't do it. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  But you can sing songs and, uh --   

aa          B.62 utt1:  Well, that's true. /  

+          A.63 utt1:  -- and tell stories about the old times.  /
sd          A.63 utt2:  I guess, you know, you were talking about your, - /
qy          A.63 utt3: was it your grand mother --    

ny          B.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.65 utt1:  -- that was having Alzheimer --   

ny^r          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.67 utt1:  -- uh, being able to tell old stories.  /
sv          A.67 utt2:  You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  And they love to recollect.  /
%          B.68 utt2:  I mean they just, you know, - /
sd          B.68 utt3: and they will just go on and on with these stories  /
sd          B.68 utt4: and they have such a memory. /  

qy          A.69 utt1:  Do they like to listen to other people recollect though? /  

ng          B.70 utt1:  My grandmother doesn't <laughter>. /  

x          A.71 utt1:  <Laughter> <noise>. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  She, she wants to te-, to tell you about her story over again  /
%          B.72 utt2: so -- -/  

b          A.73 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  -- which is fine, you know,  /
%          B.74 utt2: so, -/  

sv          A.75 utt1:  Well, that is good because we, -/
