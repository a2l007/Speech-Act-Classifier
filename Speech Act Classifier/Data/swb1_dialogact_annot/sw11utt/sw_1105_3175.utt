am          A.14 utt1:   Maybe. /  

sd          B.15 utt1:   <Laughter> [ {C But } -- +

b          A.20 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.21 utt1:   {C And } I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype [ of, + of ] secretaries was, {D you know, } overdress, over kill, sort of -- -/  

b          A.22 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          B.23 utt1:   -- {C and } --   

b          A.24 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.25 utt1:   -- [ in a s-, + in a sense, ] the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries.  /
sv          B.25 utt2:  Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public --   

b          A.26 utt1:   Right. /  

+          B.27 utt1:   -- [ it, + I find it ] a little bit strange that their priorities [ would, + would ] be to spend this money here <breathing>.  /
o          B.27 utt2:  You know, /  

b          A.28 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.29 utt1:   {E I mean, } I suppose if you were [ [ a, + a, ] + more a ] receptionist and  meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake --   

^2          A.30 utt1:   Then may-, <<faint>>. /  

+         B.31 utt1:   -- perhaps you would have to dress up. /  

sd          A.32 utt1:   {F Uh, } {D well, } I don't have the resources to just go out and buy, buy, buy anyway <lipsmack>  /
sd          A.32 utt2: {C and so } my don't change dramatically over the years.  /
sd          A.32 utt3: If I need something new, I will go and buy it.  /
sd          A.32 utt4: {C But, } basically I'm [ a, + a ] pretty much the same  /
sd          A.32 utt5: in the summertime I wear the light cotton  /
sd          A.32 utt6: {C and } in the wintertime I change to the sweaters. /  

b          B.33 utt1:   Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.33 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          A.34 utt1:   {C And, so, } it's not a whole lot [ of, + of ] change for me either.  /
sd          A.34 utt2:  {C And, } {F uh, } especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses  /
sd          A.34 utt3: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] enjoy that,  /
sd          A.34 utt4: {C but } it just wouldn't be, {F uh, } smart for me to do that in my home with my children. /  

b          B.35 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.36 utt1:   {C So, } I have to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> think about things like that, too.  /
sd          A.36 utt2:  I have given seminars before [ in, + in ] creative writing and  things like that.  /
h          A.36 utt3:  {D Now, } I don't know if they consider that a job.  /
sd          A.36 utt4: I don't really get paid for that, {F uh, } often,  /
sd          A.36 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } when I do that then [ I, + I ] think I become more businesslike.  /
sd          A.36 utt6: {F Uh, } {C but } it doesn't really change my clothing style. /  

aa          B.37 utt1:   Exactly.  /
sv          B.37 utt2: {E I mean, } you can look businesslike [ in, + in ] a [ pant-, + the same pant suit ] you would, {D you know } --   

b          A.38 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.39 utt1:   -- wear for other things.  /
%          B.39 utt2: Yeah,  /
sd          B.39 utt3: [ I'm, + I'm ] really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics. /  

b          A.40 utt1:   Oh. /  

sd          B.41 utt1:   {C And so } I used to have a problem [ when, + when ] I was working in a restaurant while I was in college --   

b          A.42 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.43 utt1:   -- and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash. /  

ba          A.44 utt1:   {F Oh, } dear. /  

o@          B.45 utt1:   <Laughter> {D So, }    

ba          A.46 utt1:   That's not helpful. /  

+@          B.47 utt1:   Right,  /
aa^r          B.47 utt2: right.  /
sv          B.47 utt3: {C But } otherwise, {D now, } [ I'm, + I ] guess we're both pretty practical <laughter>. /  

aa          A.48 utt1:   Yeah,  /
h          A.48 utt2: I guess so <laughter>.  /
fc          A.48 utt3:  {D Well, } it's been great talking to you. /  

fc          B.49 utt1:   Okay. /
