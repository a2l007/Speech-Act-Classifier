speaking in background.

qo          A.1 utt1:  <Noise>  <<sounds like in a room filled with people>> What do you think about the benefits in jobs? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {F Um, } [ I'm, +  I'm ] relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:  I think that, {F um, } our health insurance is terribly expensive. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  {C But, } {F um, } {D you know, } [ that's, + that's ] my major complaints, I guess.  /
qo          B.4 utt3:  What about you? /  

ny          A.5 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.5 utt2: {C and } a lot of times they turn down your claims  /
sd         A.5 utt3: {C so } that leaves you paying for all of it. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.6 utt2:  [ {C Or, } + {C or  } ] maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and  what isn't. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          A.7 utt2:  Yeah.  /

%          A.9 utt2: {C and, } if, - /
sd          A.9 utt3: it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, {F uh, } you just pay ten dollars  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and then, } {F uh, } the insurance pays the rest of the bill.   /
sd          A.9 utt5: {C Or } if you go outside you get, {F uh, } seventy thirty. /

%          B.10 utt2:  Now we, - /
sd          B.10 utt3: I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered  /
sd          B.10 utt4: {C but } what I found recently is what they've been doing is [ they, + they ] poll somehow the area,  /
sd          B.10 utt5: {C and then } they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {C And so } recently, [ when, + when ] we had a claim, {F um, } they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower  /
sd(^q)          B.12 utt2: {C and } when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.  /
sd*          B.12 utt3: {C And } I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, {D you know, } two doctors could balance each other out, or [ their, + {D you know, } their ] statistics aren't very accurate. /  *[[listen]]

b          A.13 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          A.13 utt2:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.   /
%          A.13 utt3: {C So, } -/  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: I would assume that <laughter> {D you know, } whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  {C But } [ it's, + it's ] difficult.  /
qo          B.16 utt2: What about [ other, + other ] benefits?  /
qo          B.16 utt3: Are there others that you're dissatisfied with? /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } I work for Sears,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F um, } that's about [ the, + the ] only real benefit you have, is health insurance. /  

qy^d          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } you have vacation,  {E I mea-, } /  

ny          A.19 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          A.19 utt5: {C and } they have a driving range and weight room  /
sv          A.19 utt6: {C and, } {D you know, } I think they even have a swimming pool -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- {C and } I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C but } {D you know, } to me vacation <laughter> [ is, + is ] an issue,  /
sv         B.22 utt4: {C and } {E I mean, } different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } {D you know, } the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, <<pause>> {D I don't know, } I suppose, {F um, } sick days.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: Some places count the number of hours  /
sv          B.24 utt3: {C and } some places just sort of believe you. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {F Um, } ours is based on number of days,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Right. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  {C But, } {F um, } otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here <<pause>>.  /
sv^t          B.28 utt3: {C So } maybe that covers the topic then. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.29 utt2:  {D Well, } I don't know, [ the work-, + the working ] conditions, {D you know, } if you could include that in benefits.  /
sv          A.29 utt3:  Some places aren't very safe to work. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] some places don't compensate you for the hazards [ that you, + that you ] have to work under. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.32 utt2:  {C Or } maybe [ a ben-, + {F uh, } not really a benefit, ] either, [ but + ] would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Right,  /
b          A.33 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {F Um, } {C but, } {D you know } I suppose some places [ are, + are ] more stringent about that than others. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: I think so. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] maybe arriving late or something like that, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.36 utt2: [ how, + how ] they enforce the rules. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh  /
x          A.37 utt2: <<pause>>.   

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C But } other than that I don't have much feeling [ for, + <laughter>  for ] the benefits,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: since, like I said, {F um, } I don't have a big problem [ with, + with ] them. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {F Um, } [ work-, + workmen's ] comp is a big thing now [ in, + in ] Texas because, {F um, } {F um, } how much it costs the employers -- /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  -- {C and } [ a, + a ] lot of them are going to their own insurance now.  /
sd          A.41 utt2:  {C And } it reduces some of the length of the benefits, [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I don't know besides that.  /
sd          A.41 utt3:  {C But } [ I, + I ] noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing. /  

sd;qy^d          B.42 utt1:  {F Oh } [ I, + I ] didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation. /  

sd;no          A.43 utt1:  {D Well, } {D well, } they still have to pay it  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C but } they buy their own instead of going through the state. /  

bk          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  {C So } apparently it costs less that way. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.46 utt2: uh-huh.  /
sv        B.46 utt3:  I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, {F um, } benefits, it's [ [ to the, + to, ] + to ] the benefit of the company <laughter>  -- /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  -- {C and } at least, {D you know, } financially in the short run,  /
