fp          A.1 utt1:  Hello,  /
fp          A.1 utt2: my name is Donna,  /
fp          A.1 utt3: {C and } I'm calling from Plano, Texas. /  

fp          B.2 utt1:  Hi,  /
fp          B.2 utt2: this is Laurie,  /
fp          B.2 utt3: {C and } I'm in Garland <laughter>. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay.  /
qy          A.3 utt2:  {F Um, } would you like me to go first? /  

na          B.4 utt1:  Sure. /  

bk          A.5 utt1:  Okay, {F um }  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I have three children, {F um, }  [ two, + two ] who are in regular school, {F uh, } eleven year old, an eight year old,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C and then } my little one, three year old, is in, {F um, } a University of Gymnastics,  /
sd          A.5 utt4: it's [ a, + a  ] preschool -- /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } I think it was really hard [ to, + {F um, } to ] pick the right, {F uh, } day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out.  /
sv          A.7 utt2:  I guess you can classify them all together. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {F Um, } some of the qualifications that I look for was [ that, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } the cost, and, {F um, } exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured,  if they had a little academic, {F um, } {F uh, } in there, and, {F um, } {D you know, } {F um, } {D you know, } what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was clean and --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- {F um, } the hours  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C and, } {F um, } [ just, + just ] kind of going by word of mouth and  finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program --   

b          B.12 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  -- that kind of stuff. -/  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } we don't have any children,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C but } we're going to have one next year <laughter>. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } congratulations. /  

ft          B.16 utt1:  Thanks.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {C So, } {F um, } that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at --    

b          A.17 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- maybe in the future.  /
sd          B.18 utt2:  We haven't quite decided if I'm going to, - /
sd          B.18 utt3: I'm working part time now,  /
sd          B.18 utt4: {C and } I don't know if I'll be doing that or # what we're going to do. # /  

qy^d          A.19 utt1:  # Or staying home. # /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {C But } if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } our church has a Mother's Day Out program --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- which they started last year,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: {C and } we know a lot of people at the church  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C so } I would feel very confident with leaving --   

sv          A.23 utt1:  That's a very good place to start I think. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  -- my child there <laughter>. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          A.25 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: the Mother's Day Out programs,  /
sd          A.25 utt4: {C and } that's where Shannon had started, in a Mother's Day Out program -- /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } the churches always have I think, [ a, + a ] pretty good program,  /
ad          A.27 utt2: {C and } you have to make sure [ that you, + {F um, } that you ] apply pretty early, because [ they do have, + a lot of places have ] very long waiting lists. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ad          A.29 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ] another question to ask is if they're, {F um, } state certified --    

aa          B.30 utt1:  Okay. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- {F um, } {D you know, } if the teachers have, {F um, } their Master's degree [ in, + in ] child education and --   

aa          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- {F um, } child development.  /
qh          A.33 utt2: {F Um, } {D you know, } [ what, + what ] kind of a structure is it going to be.  /
sv          A.33 utt3: {F Um, } when your child's a little bit older, like a three year old --   

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap.  /
qh          A.35 utt2: Is there {D like } a mandatory nap time? /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Time, uh-huh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: [ {C and } if, + {C and } ] they lay on these little mats,  /
sd          A.37 utt3: {C and } if they fall asleep, they kind of let them sleep,  /
sd          A.37 utt4: {C and } the teacher stays with the sleeping ones,  /
sd          A.37 utt5: {C and } the other ones get up and go do something else. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C So, } she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there --   

b          B.40 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- {D you know, } [ which is, + which is ] nice.   {F Um. } /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.42 utt2: {F Um, } {D you know, } it's kind of scary, I guess, because you hear so  many bad things about day cares --   

aa          A.43 utt1:  That's true. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  -- lately,  /
sv          B.44 utt2: {C and so, } [ it's, + I guess it's ] such a growing concern,  /
sv          B.44 utt3: {C but } then there's a lot of good things you don't hear. /  

aa          A.45 utt1:  Right.   /
sv          A.45 utt2: {C And } sometimes when the child's a lot younger, [ before they're really, + {F um, } before three years old, ] {D you know, } {D like } the church is a good program  /
sv          A.45 utt3: {C and } sometimes you even consider, {F um, } {D you know, } having a private person come to your own home when they're real little [ or -- +   

b          B.46 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  -- or ] something like that,  /
qh          A.47 utt2: {C and } another consideration is [  how many infants or  children are they, + ] what's the ratio [ of, + of ] teachers [ to -- +    

^2          B.48 utt1:  To ] children. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- to children -- /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.51 utt1:  -- because that makes, [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] difference,  /
qh          A.51 utt2: {C and } if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day, - /
qh          A.51 utt3: just your child, [ and, + or ] do they just put any child in any crib --    

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  -- {D you know, } - /
sv          A.53 utt2: you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time,  and not have another --   

b          B.54 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.55 utt1:  -- child use that bed --   

b          B.56 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.57 utt1:  -- {D you know. }  /
sv          A.57 utt2:  I'm sure that, {F um, } whatever you decide, you'll be happy with. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  {C And } it's exciting time to have a new one <laughter>. /  

aa          B.60 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.60 utt2: We're pretty excited. /  

ba          A.61 utt1:  I bet.  /
ba          A.61 utt2: [ That's, + that's ] wonderful. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.62 utt2: {C but } [ that, + {D you know, } we have been thinking about that, ]  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C but } it's a little ways off in the future -- /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  -- {C but, }  {F um, } I figure, {D you know, } I'd probably start asking --   

b^m          A.65 utt1:  Asking. /  

+         B.66 utt1:  -- around at church --   

b          A.67 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  -- because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be [ before they, + {D you know, } before you ] can bring them in. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  [ [ [ Some, + some  places, {F um, } start them as early as, I think, ] + {D well, } some, ] + some places ] take them as infants, I guess, {D you know, } like eight weeks, even. /  

b          B.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ad          A.71 utt1:  {F Um, } there's a place to look into, {F um, } {F um, }  /
sd          A.71 utt2: a friend of mine who's a nurse [ is, + was ] telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place [ in, + on ] Fifteenth Street,  /
%          A.71 utt3:  up, - /
sd          A.71 utt4: it's in Plano somewhere where, {F um, }  /
sd          A.71 utt5: nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of [ infants, + infants ] and then only up to like  two years old -- /  

b          B.72 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.73 utt1:  -- {C and } [ it's, + it's ] supposed to be really [ a, + a, ] - /
sd          A.73 utt2: {D you know, } some places just specialize in just real little ones -- /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  -- {C and then } other ones, {F uh, } are the older children. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.77 utt1:  {C But } it is a difficult situation, I think.  /
sv          A.77 utt2: [ When they're, + when they're ] little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry, -/
