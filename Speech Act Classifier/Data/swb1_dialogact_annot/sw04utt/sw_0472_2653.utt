b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C And } in addition to that I tinker around with it.  /

bk          B.8 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  [ {C And } + {C so } ] I write programs to do little things  /
sd          A.9 utt2: I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.  /
sd          A.9 utt3:  {C And } also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of  {D like } remind me of things  like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like. /

sv          A.15 utt3: in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming  /
sv          A.15 utt4: {C but } if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  {C But } I think you you really hit the nail on the head.  /

sd          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } {D see } of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C but } [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + that ] does amaze me. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.39 utt2: the prices had plummeted,  /
sd          A.39 utt3: you can buy [ [ the computer + the guts ] + just the guts ] with the power supply,

%          A.45 utt3: {C so }  there's, - /
sd          A.45 utt4: probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  It's a big magazine,  /

sd          A.51 utt5: [ {C And } you'll find all these things + {C and } you'll find the monitors ] forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C And } you mix and match  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C and then } you do it by mail-order.   /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C But } there's no real brands  /
sd          A.53 utt4: it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board. /  

bk          B.54 utt1:  I see.  /
qo          B.54 utt2: How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs? /

sd          A.57 utt1:  You'll notice [ that in + that ] [ [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + it's a, ] + although it's a ] magazine it's large.  /
sd          A.57 utt2:  {C And } like I said it's about an inch thick <breathing>. /
