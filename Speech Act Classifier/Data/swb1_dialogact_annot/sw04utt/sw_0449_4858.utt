sd          A.3 utt1:  On the other hand, {F uh, } the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, {F uh, } decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.5 utt1: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] on the whole I think it, {F uh, } probably was the wrong thing to do.  /

sd          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ I'm, + {F uh, } <noise> I, ] + I ] was just, {F uh, } in high school I guess  [ when it, + when it ]  ended. /

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C And } I was glad it was over by then. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.  /

sd          B.14 utt4: {C and } for some of them it was just kind of,  {A I don't know, } not so much a holiday,  /
sd          B.14 utt5: I guess that's how they tend to talk about it.  But that they just kind of lived out in the woods  /

sv          B.18 utt3: to me it seems like we only went halfway.   If even halfway. /

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And } I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, {F uh, } in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C and } actually when you think back on the big events of the war, [ it was, + {F uh, } it was ] almost a personal struggle among these three, {F uh,  }  /
sv          A.23 utt3: I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> {F Uh, } they're certainly all leaders  /

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:  {C And } I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, {F uh, } early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> people saw the cold war as, {F uh, } you had to draw a line [ and, +  and ] defend it.  /
sv          A.27 utt2:  Otherwise [ there'd be, + they'd get ] you someplace else. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true.  That, {F uh, } there might have been a better place to draw the line <laughter>.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {F Uh, } [ I guess you can, + I guess you can ] say that [ a, + a ]  certain  amount of resolve and willingness to fight, {F uh, } brought the cold war to an end.  /
sv          A.29 utt3:  {C But } I don't think you can just fight anywhere [ just, + just ] in order to, {F uh, } call the bully out and beat him.  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C And } I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war.  /
sd          A.29 utt5:  They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line,   

x@         B.30 utt1:  <Talking>.   *[[slash error]]

sd          A.33 utt3: [ the, + like I said, the ] more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable.  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C But } the accumulative effect was to really get into [ a, + a ] hopeless situation where, - /
sd          A.33 utt5: {C and } as you say, {F uh, } going halfway was probably worse than, {F uh, } [  committing, +  {F uh, } committing ] to a completely  and, {F uh, } winning it, whatever that would mean. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah.  /

sv          B.34 utt3: I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah <throat_clearing>. /

qh          A.45 utt1: [ What, + what ] about the domestic effects  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {D like } I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, {F uh, } possible and even popular to, {F uh, } criticize the government.  /

sd          A.45 utt4: that pendulum started to swing, {F uh, } [ ma-, + maybe ] even too far.   To the point where, {F uh, } {F uh, } supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional <laughter> --
