REMARKS:        The first time through Speaker A kept cutting out, but I
managed to pick it back up the second time.  Then at the end of the 
conversation, Speaker B was being run over by Speaker A which made it hard 
to understand what he said in several places.

sd(^q)          A.13 utt8: the jury, {D you know, } decided, {F hey, } it's time to crackdown here, {D you know, }  /

sd          A.15 utt4: {C and } they were told that, {F uh, } he would probably serve three,

sd          A.19 utt2: However, they could not tell [ the jud-, + the jury ] that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C So, }  the jury didn't know about it,  /
