qy^d          A.3 utt2:  {C So } you probably could give some great advice. /  

nd          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D well, } I don't know about that, <breathing>  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C but } [ I, + in fact, I'm ] in the process of trying to choose a P H D school. /

b          B.12 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } my area of expertise, it's information systems, which is a little bit less technical, I think, [ than, + {F uh, } than ] computer science.   /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C But } my area of expertise is, {F uh, } {F uh, } human computer interaction. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And } I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, {F uh, } because [ it's of, + ] I'm working with voice systems. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b^m          A.17 utt1:  Yeah.  /
ba          A.17 utt2: [ {C So, } + {C so, } ] good luck.  /
ad^t          A.17 utt3: I guess we should talk about giving advice,  though.  /
qw          A.17 utt4:  [ [ Wh-, + what, ] + what ] type of advice do you think you'd give to [ a, + a ] parent? /  

qy^h          B.18 utt1:  To a parent? /  

ny          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } the thing is, when you're a kid --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think they know what they want. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          B.24 utt1:  [ {C An, } + {C and, } ]  {E I mean, } choosing from my experience, {D you know, } I thought, {D you know, } [ my, + I know what I want a lot more than my ] parents know what I want. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

h          B.26 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school,  /
sv          B.26 utt3: {D you know, } the size of it or, -/  

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.27 utt2:  I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  [ I kn-, + I know ] very few people that, {F uh, } started in one field and stayed with it.  /
%          A.29 utt2: {D You know, } they, - /
aa          A.29 utt3: I think that's what you just said, {D you know, } having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.29 utt4: I think that's much more important.  /
sd          A.29 utt5: [ [ I, + I think I'd, ] + I'd ] advise a parent to send a kid to a school, though, that has a number of different types of programs, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.29 utt6: that, {F uh, } some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer,  /
sv          A.29 utt7: {C but } some of [ [ the, + {F uh, } the small, ] + some of the larger small ] schools, {D you know, } I guess around three or four thousand students --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- [ have a, + ] can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C so } if the kid does change, they don't have to transfer,  /
sv          A.31 utt3: {C or } they don't have to, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sv          A.31 utt4: I don't know, they don't have to give up years [ of, + {D you know, } of ] credit transfer and things. /  

aa          B.32 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.32 utt2: That's disruptive. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

x          B.34 utt1:  <Breathing>.   

%          A.35 utt1:  <Lipsmack> I normally, - /
sv          A.35 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] parents hate to hear this, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C because } [ I, + I ] actually teach college,  /
sd          A.35 utt4: [ I hate to, + {F uh, } I hate to ] talk to the parents  /
sv          A.35 utt5: [ because, + {F um } <lipsmack> one of the reasons is because, ] {D you know, } the kid doesn't know exactly what they want,  /
sd(^q)          A.35 utt6: {C and } I always say make sure you major,    

x          B.36 utt1:  <Talking>.   

+          A.37 utt1:  in something that you like, even if it's not going to be your career vocation,   

x          B.38 utt1:  </Talking>.   

+          A.39 utt1:  because you'll get better grades.  /
sv          A.39 utt2:  [ I, + I ] think most employers would probably rather hire, {D you know, } [ a, + a ] three six [ in, + {F um, } <lipsmack> in ] history, {F uh, } to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

qy          A.41 utt1:  Does that make sense? /

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.43 utt2: I always, {D you know, } tell them that you should major in something [ you, + you're ] going to get good grades in.    

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  Because [ that, + that's ] always, I think, more important, {D you know, } overall.  /
h          A.45 utt2:  I don't know. /  

t3          B.46 utt1:  {F Uh, } <<muffled>> give me five minutes. /

sd          A.55 utt2:  I teach at a public school, actually,  /
sd          A.55 utt3: {C and } I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than [ a lot of the public sch-, + a lot of the private schools. ]   /

sv          A.57 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F um } <lipsmack>, {C and } ] [ I really think, + I think ] I'm getting a better </noise> caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,  /
sv          A.57 utt2: {C and } I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated,  /
sv          A.57 utt3: where at the public school, I don't think as many parents [ [ are public, + are, ] + are college educated, ]  /
sv          A.57 utt4: {C and } [ I don't, + I think ] because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, {D you know, }  /
%          A.57 utt5:  [ they're not, + th-, ] - /
sv          A.57 utt6: [ it, + it's ] the minimal cost.  /

sd          A.79 utt3: {D see, } [ I'm, + I'm ] at the University of Maryland, {C so } in [ this, + this ] region, {F um, } though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland, my diploma will still say University of Maryland. /

+          A.85 utt1:  {D you know, }  /
sv          A.85 utt2: {C so } it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school, /

sv          A.87 utt1:  {C and } technical people know that.  /

b          B.88 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          A.89 utt1:  {D you know, }  {C but } then when I went, {F um, } <lipsmack> for graduate work, {D you know, } or for a new job, people said to me, {D you know, } Shippensburg State, where is that, {D you know } <laughter>. /

sv          A.93 utt2: that's important,  /
sv          A.93 utt3: {F um, } <lipsmack>.  I think it depends on [ if you want to be a, + if you want a ] regional job or a national job,  /
sv          A.93 utt4: you need that first,   

b          B.94 utt1:  Yeah. /

aa          A.97 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          A.97 utt2: yeah. /
