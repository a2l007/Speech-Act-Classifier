=============================================================================
  

qo          A.1 utt1:  What do you think about the, {F uh, } Peace Corps or public service commitment? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } that's the first I've ever heard of it.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:   I haven't heard [ of it, + anything ] too much about it.  /
%          B.2 utt3: {F Um, } /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } I think it was, {F uh, } thought up when there was    so much controversy about reviving a draft  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C and } people said, {D well, } [ they, +  {F uh, } young people ] who were drafted have to provide military service to the country,  /
sv          A.3 utt3:  {C but } there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, {F um, } some sort of public service,    

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or,  {F uh, } various other things of that sort.  /
sv          A.5 utt2:  {C And } it seems to me <baby>  that [ it's, + it's ] not a totally bad idea,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C but } I don't quite see how they'd make it work. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qh          A.7 utt1:  How would they decide who goes into, {F uh, }  building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia? /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.8 utt2: yeah.  /
%          B.8 utt3:  I, - /
%          B.8 utt4: the, - /
sd          B.8 utt5: my first impression was,  {F um, } it would be [ v-, + very ] good.  /
sv          B.8 utt6:  I think it would be good for people to serve,  /
sd          B.8 utt7:  {C but } I don't know if it should be an option.  /
sv          B.8 utt8:  It would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids.  /
sd          B.8 utt9:  {C And } I think there are some available now where they are able to work,  /
sv          B.8 utt10: {C but } making it a mandatory thing kind of, -/  

aa          A.9 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.9 utt2: [ the, + the ] difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or  involuntary. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C And } the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C And } some people would get military service  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C and } some people would get civilian, {F uh, }    

b@          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh.   

+          A.15 utt1:  service, like working in hospitals.  /
%          A.15 utt2:  This, - /
sv          A.15 utt3: I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do,    

+@          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  when people were drafted   and they refused to serve in the Army,  /
sd          A.17 utt2:  they were allowed to do hospital service or, {F uh, } things like that,  /
%          A.17 utt3: {C and } if they re-, - /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C or }  farm work in World War One I remember --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- {F uh, } reading about.  /
sv          A.19 utt2: [ {C And, } +  {C and } ]  I suppose that there is, {F uh, } justification for taking everybody if you take anybody. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C But } I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, {F uh, } sorting them out, assigning them,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  training them would be insurmountable. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  It seems like you'd have a lot more [ conscie-, + conscientious ]  objectors if they had that choice. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.25 utt2: {D well } <laughter> it's a possibility. /  

b          B.26 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {D you know, } [ I'd, + I'd ]  much rather work in a hospital [ than, + than ] to go war  /
sv          B.26 utt3: {C and } I'm sure most young men and women would.  /
%          B.26 utt4:  {C And  so, }  {F uh, } -/  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that [ in the, + in the ]  cases [ that, + like that, ] {F uh, } they had to be, {F uh, } pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and  religious beliefs and so forth,    

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  {C and } that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: It was, {F uh, } something that was a fundamental part  of their philosophy of life. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
ba          B.30 utt2: {D Well, } that makes sense.  /
sv          B.30 utt3: {C And  then }  you run into, again, [ to, + ] {F um, } the bureaucracy in running it.  /
qh          B.30 utt4:  {D You know, } how you going to --   

b          A.31 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then -- /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Sure,  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {C and, }   

%          B.34 utt1:  -- {D so, } -/  

+          A.35 utt1:  in addition to that, we have the cost because you have to pay something for,   

b          B.36 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  their room and board  /
sv          A.37 utt2: {C and  then }  you have to pay them some kind of a stipend,    

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  {F uh, } even if it's {D like } the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home,    

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  you [ have t-, + have to ] pay them something. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  Plus the training involved. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

b^m          B.44 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.44 utt2: that would be expensive in most cases. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah, /  

%          B.46 utt1:   (( {C Because } )) , -/  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {D Now } I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps, {F uh, } back in the mid sixties -- /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  -- {C and } it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,  /
sd          A.49 utt2: {C but } on the other hand, I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was.  /
sd          A.49 utt3:  I don't,   

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  know what we got for all the money.  /
sv          A.51 utt2:  We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, {F uh, } what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh,    

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  and to, {F uh, } Algeria and to, {F uh, } Southeast Asia and lots of, {F uh, } out-of-the-way places.  /
sd          A.53 utt2:  {C But } I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went,   

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.55 utt1:  in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better. /  

%          B.56 utt1:  {D Well, } I know in, - /
sd          B.56 utt2:  I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C And } I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.  /
sd          B.58 utt2:  It taught me not to be so self-centered  and [ it, + ] {D you know, } to think of others. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C But } I don't know if I was doing it in different situation,  {D you know, } not a really religious background, [ if, + if ]  I would get a lot out of it.  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {D You know, }  I think I did because [ it, + {D you know, } it ]  emphasized that sort of thing.  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {D You know, }  a lot of --   

b          A.61 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.62 utt1:  -- self evaluation. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  {C And } it was definitely voluntary, too.  /
sd          A.63 utt2:  They were not drafting you and  sending you,   

b          B.64 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.65 utt1:  against your will. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.66 utt2: {C And } [ that, +  I'm sure that  ] would make a big difference, too.  /
%          B.66 utt3:  {D You know, }  (( you've got )) , -/  

aa          A.67 utt1:  Yeah.  /
qo          A.67 utt2: {D Well, } what about a voluntary program?  /
qy          A.67 utt3:  Do you think that would be a good idea? /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } like I say, I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for [ a youth, + {D like } teenagers  ] to go and do, {F um, } work in the national parks and work in, {F uh, } neighborhoods to [ do, + ] {F um, } clean up and that sort of thing.  /
sd          B.68 utt2: {D But } I don't know what organization it's under.  /
sd          B.68 utt3: I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private --   

sd          A.69 utt1:  I don't either. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- charity that's put it together.  /
sv          B.70 utt2:   {C But } I know that that helps a lot with training and, {F um } --   

aa          A.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.71 utt2: out here in California,   

+          B.72 utt1:  -- a lot of, -/  

+          A.73 utt1: there's a program like that for, {F uh, } juvenile delinquents, [ the, + the ] ones that are not dangerous  /
sd          A.73 utt2: {C and } they don't have to be locked up go to these, {F uh, } camps.  /
sd          A.73 utt3: {C And } they,   

b          B.74 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.75 utt1:  do forestry work.  /
sd          A.75 utt2: They maintain trails  /
sd          A.75 utt3:  {C and } they, {F uh, } put up signs  /
sd          A.75 utt4: {C and } they do fire prevention work and (( certainly ))  things of that sort. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C And } that I know is run by the State,  /
sd          A.77 utt2: {C but } there may be other things.  /
sd          A.77 utt3: I'm not so sure what kind of, {F uh, } training that is for the future for those kids. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qh          B.78 utt2: how much benefit,   

sv          A.79 utt1:  It's probably [ a, +    

+          B.80 utt1:  it'll do them in the long run? /  

+          A.81 utt1:  a ] very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble,  /
sv          A.81 utt2:  {C but } whether it's something that they can put [ to, + to ]  economic use later on is a different subject. /  

aa          B.82 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          B.82 utt2: especially [ in, + {D you know, } if ]  you take [ a, + a ] child that's from the inner city and then put them in [ the, + a ] middle of a park,  /
sv          B.82 utt3: if they go back to the inner city, they may not see trees for a while,   

aa          A.83 utt1:  That's true <laughter>. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  much less be able to take care of them <laughter>. /
