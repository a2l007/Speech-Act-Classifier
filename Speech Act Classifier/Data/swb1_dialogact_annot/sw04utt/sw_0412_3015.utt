sv          @A.1 utt1:  {F Uh, } national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Right. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C because, } {F uh, } the articles that I've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that, {F uh, } - /
%          A.3 utt3: what i-, - /
sd          A.3 utt4: [ stay, + stay ] in line for, {F uh, } four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.4 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.4 utt3: [ I'm, + <throat_clearing> I'm ] sort of mixed on this.  /
sv          B.4 utt4:   I think that [ the, + the ] answer <throat_clearing> may lie [ in, + {F uh, } not in ] so much a, {F uh, } national kind of medical thing that  {D li-, }  {D like }  England has but more of a, {F um, } <throat_clearing> national insurance, {F uh, } sort of clearinghouse or whatever.  /
sv          B.4 utt5: I think that, {F uh, } too many, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.4 utt6: the problem [ [ with, + with ] + ] right now is [ w-, + ]  that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through  /
sd          B.4 utt7: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ I think that, + I think ] [  you, +  you ] mentioned Canada.  /
sd          B.4 utt8:  I think that they have a system where, {F uh, } [ they, + the  government ] deals [ with  the, + with, ] - /
sd          B.4 utt9: {E I mean, } [ you, + you ] go to whoever you want but file through [ one, +  one ] [ s-, + particular, ]     

b          A.5 utt1:  {F Um, } I see. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  {F uh, } setup  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } that way <throat_clearing> [ they, + they ] are able to reduce prices because  [ they've, + ]  {D you know, } [ it's,  + it's ] all [ one, + one ] centralized thing. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.7 utt2: {D Well, } [ I, + I ] think that, {F uh, } again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own,    

x          B.8 utt1:  <<Very faint>>  <throat_clearing>.   

+          A.9 utt1:  if you don't have a company [ supporting you in the, + ] {F uh, } picking up the major portion of your health insurance,   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  the cost is [ p-, + almost prohibitive. ] /  

aa          B.12 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  {F Uh, } <throat_clearing> [ I, + I ] was listening, {F uh, } on the radio the other day  /
sd          B.12 utt3: {C and } they were talking that, [ [ s-, + s-, ] + something ] like this, - /
sd          B.12 utt4: I think they were talking about the fact that, {F um, } the money that could be saved, {F um, } <throat_clearing> in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, {F um, }   [ could, + {F uh, } could, ] - /
sv          B.12 utt5: they could  make it, [ [ i-, + i-, ] + ] provide health insurance [ to, + to ]  people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.13 utt2: <lipsmack> {F Uh, } we're currently,  where I'm working now, under Blue Cross. /  

x          B.14 utt1:  <<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  I don't know what the total cost of the program is  /
sd          A.15 utt2: {C but } for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars [ a, + a ] month or something like  that. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {C So } I assume that probably the total [ cove-, + cost ] is probably,   

x          B.18 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          A.19 utt1:  three fifty to four hundred.   /
sd          A.19 utt2: They're probably picking up about half of it. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C And } that's a pretty good policy,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: {C but } if you had something like one of these, {F uh, }    

x          B.22 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          A.23 utt1:  health maintenance programs, /  

x          B.24 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

sd@          A.25 utt1:  or one of, whatever the type name is,    

b          B.26 utt1:   Yeah,  /
^2          B.26 utt2: H M O. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  H M O, {F uh, } [ where the, + {F uh, } where ] you go to the doctor  and it only costs you ten dollars  and the insurance picks up the rest.    

x          B.28 utt1:  <<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.   

+          A.29 utt1:  If you tried to buy something like that, [  I'm prob-, + it would probably ] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: {C and } [ they're, + <throat_clearing> they're ] fairly expensive.  /
sd          B.30 utt3: [ [ [ I, + I, ] + {F um, } I ha-, ] + I was ] on an H M O, {F uh, } up until last year --    

b          A.31 utt1:  <<Very faint>>  Yeah. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- [ and, + ] {F uh, } through work.  /
%          B.32 utt2: {C And } it was, - /
sd          B.32 utt3: I forget how much I paid a month  /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C but } it [ was much, + {D you know, } is at least twice if not ] more expensive than <throat_clearing> the regular health care. /  

b         A.33 utt1:  <<Very faint>>  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the reason [ I, +  I ] quite was  [ because of, + {F uh, } not because ] I didn't  like it,  /
sd          B.34 utt2: [ I, + I  ] really kind of did.  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {F Uh, } the reason I quite was just because [ [ the, + the  ]  doctor + [ a, + a ] certain doctor  ] that we [ en-, +  enjoyed ] going to was no longer associated with that H M O  /
sd          B.34 utt4: {C so } [ we, +  my wife ] decided she wanted [ to, + to ] stay with that doctor, /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C so, }  <throat_clearing> we went [ to the, + to [ the, + the ] ] medical insurance that we have [ at, + here at ] work, /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.38 utt1:  {C and, } {F uh, } <breathing> [ [ I, +  {F uh, }   I  ] like the, + I like the ]  convenience of the H M O [ in, + in ] a certain respect because [ it, + ] {F uh, }  even though  you're, - /
sv          B.38 utt2: once you  find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.  /
sv(^q)          B.38 utt3:  {D You know, } a lot of people complain saying {D well, } I don't want to, {F uh, } have to be told who I need to go to  /
sv          B.38 utt4: {C but, } {D you know, } <noise> if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference.    

aa          A.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa         A.39 utt2:  that's right. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  Because you can, {D you know, } [ if, + if ] you find someone you really like - /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C and  then, } we did find several good doctors.  /
sd          B.40 utt3:  {C And, }  {F um, } <throat_clearing> like you say it's, {F uh, } five dollars an office visit.  /
sd          B.40 utt4:  {C And, }  {F um, } my wife was in the hospital [ had our, +  had our ] daughter  /
sd          B.40 utt5: {C and } I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars --   

ba          A.41 utt1:  {F Oh, } goodness. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- for everything.  /

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  [ Include-, + including  ] a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C but } [ that was, +  that was ] still included in [ that pr-, +  that cost ]  /
%          B.46 utt3: {C so. } -/  

b          A.47 utt1:  <<Very faint>> Yeah. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> It's really nice because [ [ [ they, +  th-, ] + {D you know, } their, ] + their ] attitude is different [ than, + than  ] a  regular, {F uh, } [ insurance, + {F uh, } health insurance, ] {F uh, } [ the, + ] [ in, + in ] a, H M O, {D you know, }  /

+          B.50 utt1:  {D you know, }  and have you come in, {D you know, }  /
