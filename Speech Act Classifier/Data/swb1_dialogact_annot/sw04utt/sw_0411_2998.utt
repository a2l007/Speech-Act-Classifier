qo          A.1 utt1:  {F Um, } what do you think <laughter> the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas, -/

sd          B.4 utt1:  {C but } the major cause here, {A and we always seem to, }    {A and it seems to be validated by the press, } is the car pollution.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: We don't have too much industrial pollution. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.5 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } car pollution seems to be the one  and only thing [ that, + that ] I can really put my finger on here. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {F Um, } that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major, {F um, } industry except for, {F uh, } government and services.   /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C And } [ the, + the ] transportation situation is such that, {F uh, } all the car pollution [ is, + is ] absolutely awful.  /
sd          A.7 utt3:  {F Um, } also the  [ (( worth ))  of the + ] hub of three airports - /
sd          A.7 utt4: in this general area there is, {F uh, } National, Dulles, and then, {F uh, } Baltimore,  Washington.  /
%          A.7 utt5: {C And } it, - /
sd          A.7 utt6: interestingly  some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from, {F uh, } {F uh, } airplanes is extraordinary. /

sd          B.10 utt1:  I didn't know that. /  

sv          A.11 utt1:  {C and } that's  (( always ))  something that, {D you know, } [ you just don't real, + you don't think  ] about. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {D Well, } most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  {C But }  the, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.13 utt2: apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          B.16 utt2: {D You know, } {F uh, } [ i-, + I  guess it ] talked about all types of pollution.  /
sd          B.16 utt3:  I happen to [ r-, + just read ] something the other day at least in the Boston paper there were three things [ that, + that ] come to note.  /
sd          B.16 utt4: One, is that the carbon fluorides that are, <breathing> {F uh, } being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer   /
%          B.16 utt5:  {C and } again - /
sd          B.16 utt6: {C and }   now they've located [ another one + {E or }  [ la-, + ]  {E rather }  an expanding one  ] in the northern hemisphere.  /
%          B.16 utt7:  {C So } car-, - /
sd          B.16 utt8: {C so } I'm quite concerned.  /
sv          B.16 utt9:  I don't think it's involved any longer [ with, + with, ] {F uh, } hair sprays or those th-, -/

b          B.18 utt1:  No,  /

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          B.42 utt1:  No,  /
