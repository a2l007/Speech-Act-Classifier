qo          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on? /  

sv          B.2 utt1:  I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  I have to agree with you there.  /
sv          A.3 utt2: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] think that, {F uh, } for once, [ we should, + we shouldn't ] even be [ at, + at ] these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, [ we really don't have too much of a, {F uh, } real in-, + we shouldn't have too much of a real interest ] in deciding who's land it is.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: Just let these people fight it out -- /  

aa          B.4 utt1:  I agree. /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  -- {D you know, }  we've got so many domestic problems,  /
qh          A.5 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] what does it cost these people over there, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

qo          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } {C so } how about the Soviet Union.  /
qo          A.7 utt2:  What do you think's going to happen there.  /
qo          A.7 utt3:  The break ups? /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  I think that's great.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {F Um, } I'm glad to see that,  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but } [ I, + again, I ] don't want to see us pour [ a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, + {F uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } a whole lot under any circumstances ] because [ I, + I ] don't know,  /
sv          B.8 utt4: [ I'm, + I'm ] a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,  /
sd          B.8 utt5: {C and so, } [ I'm, + I'm ] not much in favor of it,  /
sd          B.8 utt6: {C but } I'm glad to see us advising them -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  -- that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  That's right,  /
aa^r          A.11 utt2: that's right. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {C But } I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,  /
sv          B.12 utt2: even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody [ who, + who ] is working on that problem.   /
sv          B.12 utt3: {C And } [ I, + I ] haven't seen that in the last eleven years,  /
sv          B.12 utt4: {C so } --   

%          A.13 utt1:  {D Well, } all I've seen. -/  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- they don't seem to have a clue. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  <Laughter> Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side [ [ of, + of, ] + of ] his political affairs.  /
sv          A.15 utt2: [ I, + I ] think Bush's kind of followed suit.  /
sv          A.15 utt3: {F Um, } international is important,  /
sv          A.15 utt4: {C but, }  {F uh, } we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.  /
sv          A.15 utt5: {F Uh, } {D you know, } {C and then } there's the homeless issue,  /
sv          A.15 utt6: {C and } there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, {F uh, } hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think,  /
sv          A.15 utt7: {C and } we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:  {F Oh, } I agree.  /
sv          B.16 utt2:  [ [ I just, + I think we got, ] + once we ] started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of [ the, + the ] world bank, [ and -- + ]   

b          A.17 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- as far as aid is concerned,  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C and } I think there's a limit,  /
sv          B.18 utt3: {C and } we passed it a long time ago. /  

aa          A.19 utt1:  <Laughter> I agree.  /
sv          A.19 utt2:  We've been writing off way too many [ bad debts -- +   

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+@          A.21 utt1:  -- {F uh, } country bad debts. ]   

sd          B.22 utt1:  That's another thing I don't understand [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] things like selling technology and, {F uh, } even military hardware to foreign governments and then  forgiving their debt -- /  

+@          A.23 utt1:  Exactly. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  -- <Laughter> to me that just doesn't make any sense,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: [ as, + as ] much in debt as we are -- -/  

aa          A.25 utt1:  I know it. /  

h          B.26 utt1:  -- [ I just, + I don't know. ]  /
sv          B.26 utt2:  I think it's definitely time for a change,  /
%          B.26 utt3: {C but } I don't see anybody, - /
sd          B.26 utt4: I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and  Republicans,  /
sv          B.26 utt5: {C and } it's either one way or the other,  /
sv          B.26 utt6: [ this -- +   

b          A.27 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- it ] [ s-, + seems ] to be we're turning into a black and white society,  /
sv          B.28 utt2: you either do it this way  /
sv          B.28 utt3: {C or } you do it that way,  /
sv          B.28 utt4: {C and } there's no in between -- /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  That's right,  /
sv          A.29 utt2: you're either liberal  or you're conservative, /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  -- {C and } [ that, + {F uh, } it ] obviously isn't working. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  {D Well, } I think, {F uh, } it wouldn't hurt,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: {C and } I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] real force [ [ in, + in  the, ] + {F uh, } in Congress, ]  /
aa          A.31 utt3: {C but, }  {F uh, } you're right,  /
sv          A.31 utt4: there's just too many issues that come up that, {F uh, } our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or  it's a Republican issue -- /  

b          B.32 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  -- {C and } if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, {F uh, } we might have [ [ a, + a lot better, ] + a lot more ] efficient running government and a lot better laws passed. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  {F Oh, } I agree with you.  /
sv          B.34 utt2: {D Well, } of course, {D you know, } we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms, /  

x          A.35 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          B.36 utt1:  {C and, }  {F uh, } as soon [ as, + as ] we can get, - /
sv          B.36 utt2: of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, [ he, + he ] just lines up people against him  /
sv          B.36 utt3: {C so, }    

x          A.37 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.38 utt1:  [ it's not too, + it's not too ] often that you see him swaying too many opinions.  /
sv          B.38 utt2: He's, {F uh, } usually on the ninety-eight to two side,  /
sv          B.38 utt3: he's the one of the two that votes, /  

bh^m          A.39 utt1:  He's one of the two, {F huh. } /  

ny          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^e          B.40 utt2: he's,   

x          A.41 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          B.42 utt1:  very ineffective, I think. /  

^h          A.43 utt1:  {D Well, } let's see,  /
qy^g          A.43 utt2: Senators are in for six years, right -- /  

na          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

qw          A.45 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } when did you guys vote him into office? /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } unfortunately nineteen ninety. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {F Oh, } you're stuck. /  

aa          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.48 utt2: we're stuck with him for --   

x          A.49 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.50 utt1:  -- a little while longer,  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,  /
%          B.50 utt3: {D so, } I hate, -/
