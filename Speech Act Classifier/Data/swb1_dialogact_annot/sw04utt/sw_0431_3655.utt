sd          A.15 utt1:  <Breathing> {C But } [ I kind of, + I ] liked it some ways  /

sv          A.15 utt3: {F Uh, } I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important. /

sd          A.19 utt3: {C but } I only had her going two days  /
sd         A.19 utt4: {C and } most of the other kids were going more days <throat_clearing>  /
sd          A.19 utt5: {C so } that was probably my own fault --   

bk          B.20 utt1:  Oh. /

sd          A.23 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D you know, } one thing I noticed is, {F uh, } {F uh, } just, they were trying [ to get her + to, teach her ] to write her name,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way, {F oh, } not in a natural [ sh-, + form. ] /  

bh          B.24 utt1:  {F Oh, } she did? /  

ny          A.25 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd(^q)          A.25 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } I was kind of [ m-, +  mad ] that they had never noticed that  and,  either pointed it out to me [ or, + or, ] {F uh } tried to say, look,  you're holding your, - /
sd          A.25 utt3: she was holding her  pencil in the right fingers and stuff.  /

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yes. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: She was four, or three,  /
%          A.29 utt3: yeah,  /
sd          A.29 utt4: [ she was, + {F uh, } it was ] last year  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on  /
%          A.29 utt6: {C and }  I w-, <breathing> - /
sd          A.29 utt7: like I said, I didn't notice it till then.    

b          B.30 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  Because I hadn't worked with writing letters  or anything  and --   

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- stuff like that. /  

qy          B.34 utt1:  {D Well, } they'd never picked it out, though? /

qrr^d          B.38 utt1:  {C Or } just never said anything. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  Course, like I said, I took her two days a week  /
sd          A.39 utt2: {C and } maybe that was, - /
sd          A.39 utt3: my main reason for taking <noise> her was, {F uh, } just social skills --   

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- more than anything else. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:   I felt she needed the s-, - /
sd          A.43 utt2: <noise> just,  I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially -- /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.45 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {D Well, } one thing that's  kind of different, too, though,  a preschool [ than, + than ] taking [ a, + a ] infant [ or -- + ]   

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- to at a day-care where they're --   

b          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- taken care of. -/  

sv          A.51 utt1:  I think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: Preschool's a different thing,  /
sv          A.51 utt3: {C but } I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know  [ [ and, + or ] + ] unless you have awfully good <laughter> references.    

aa          B.52 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.52 utt2: yeah. /

h          A.53 utt2: I don't know,  /
sv          A.53 utt3: it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  {D Well, } I think it's hard to leave them,  /
sv          B.54 utt2: it is. /  

aa^m          A.55 utt1:  It is.  /
sv          A.55 utt2: The older ones it's not,  /
sv          A.55 utt3: you don't even really have any real worries, because you know that they'll play with whoever's there  /
sv          A.55 utt4: {C and } they usually adapt pretty well. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.57 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.58 utt2: [ it, + it ] is, I think, just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own <laughter> families will. /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  {D Well, } {C and } you know [ their, + kind of their ] schedules  /

sv          A.61 utt5: It's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive,  /
sv          A.61 utt6: {C and } at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess,  /
sv          A.61 utt7: {C and } you haven't got anything done  /
