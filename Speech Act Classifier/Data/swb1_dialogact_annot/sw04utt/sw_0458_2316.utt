sv          A.1 utt1:  [ It's, + it's ] hard topic because - /
qh          A.1 utt2: [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] it doing a good job or a bad job - /
sv          A.1 utt3:  {C and } you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qr          B.2 utt2: {C and } are you talking about public schools being lower level, high school level or --   

sd          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } [ public school all the way up + --   

+          B.4 utt1:  -- # state school. # /

bk          B.6 utt1:  Okay,  /
sv          B.6 utt2: {C but } you're excluding high-level education. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa          A.7 utt2: {D well, } yeah  /
sd          A.7 utt3: I am.  {F Oh, } /  

bk          B.8 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          A.9 utt1: [ A-, + actually ] I think that, [ I, + ] higher level education, - /
sv          A.9 utt2: I don't think there's so much of a problem there.  /
sd          A.9 utt3:  It's pretty much funded well.  /
sv          A.9 utt4:  There are small colleges that I'm sure are struggling  /
%          A.9 utt5: {C but, }  {F uh, } it's the job that [ the, + the ] high school and the grade schools are doing that I see, in a area like ours, - /
%          A.9 utt6:  our school, - /
sd          A.9 utt7: even a bad school is a good school up here, where, if I lived in New York City or Washington, D C, {F uh, } I would seriously consider moving if I had a child.  /
sd          A.9 utt8:  I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there.  /
sd          A.9 utt9: {C But, }  of course, people are trapped economically  /
sd          A.9 utt10: {C and } they can't do that. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.10 utt2: I know down here the school's are, {D you know, } - /
h          B.10 utt3: I don't know,  /
%          B.10 utt4: they rate, - /
sd          B.10 utt5: I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio  /
sd          B.10 utt6: {C and } the schools down here rate, {D you know, } bottom ten percent across the country  /
sd          B.10 utt7: {C and } having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why.  /
sd          B.10 utt8:  {C Because } they're so far behind and so poorly staffed, half the time the teachers don't know what's going on. /  

sv          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } that's really too bad because [ it, + it's ] giving some people unfair advantage.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {E I mean } [ we, + our ] high school up here is like a junior college in Florida -- /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  -- what we learned. -/  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } that was my experience going through junior high up there  /
sd          B.14 utt2: when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done.    

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  Because we were so far advanced.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } I'd been in a parochial school before junior high  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } even the public schools are behind the parochial schools. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {C So, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.18 utt2: [ you, + you ] pick a career path  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C or } you get counseling earlier  /
sd          B.18 utt4: {C and then } [ you, + you ]  learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  {D Like } they have that down there that, -/  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {D Well, } they talk about it  /
%          B.20 utt2: {C and } there are a few in some of the more,  like in - /
sd          B.20 utt3: I live in a big Metroplex  /
sd          B.20 utt4: {C and } some of [ the, + the ] better parts of the Metroplex, [ the, + the ] suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools.  /
%          B.20 utt5: {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } -/  

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: it's like [ if, + if ] your father owns a grocery store  and you're really interested in that,  /
sv          A.21 utt3: there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some --   

aa          B.22 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- # general # business courses in high school. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  {C Or } if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school  that specializes in science or art.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {D You know, } there's no point in, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.24 utt3:  I'm an engineering student  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } if I have to go take art classes, {D you know, } I'm not going to use them.   /
sd          B.24 utt5: {C And } through high school I could have gone so much further if I'd gone to a school that was directed. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.25 utt2: that's true.  /
sd          A.25 utt3: I was fortunate.  /
sd          A.25 utt4: [  I'm a, + I'm  a ]  technician  /
sd          A.25 utt5: {C and } we had a  vocational, {F uh, } electronics in our high school. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right,  /
b^m          B.26 utt2: in high school. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C So } when I went to my first year of tech school, I had a very easy time because our high school --   

b          B.28 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- had [ a, +  a ] good program. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  I think the schools today, {D you know, }  [ the public schools are just, + they're just ] overrun, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.30 utt2: they don't know what to do,  /
sv          B.30 utt3: there's too many kids and  not enough teachers  /
sv          B.30 utt4: {C and } too many of the kids don't care. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: I find [ [ that + --   

%          B.32 utt1:  {C And, } /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- that  the, ] + that ] [ in the, + <door> in the ] cities, it's more like the kids go there [ so + ] socialize --   

aa          B.34 utt1:  Right. /  

+         A.35 utt1:  -- not really to learn  /
sd         A.35 utt2: {C and } the parents send them there because they're supposed to,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: [ {C and } + {C plus }  ] it gets them out of their hair.  /
sd          A.35 utt4:  {C And } I also find [ that, + that ] you can send a kid to school,  /
sv          A.35 utt5: {C but } if don't work with them as a parent, I think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } there's some kids that, {D you know, } want to go learn,  /
sv          B.36 utt3: {C but } most of them just want to go play. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv*          A.37 utt2: {D well } [ I could, + I could ] see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if, [ t-, + they're, ] {D you know, } come from a broken home  and they're parents are more concerned about trying to work  / *[[sp:their]]
sd          A.37 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C or } ] maybe they're unemployed  /
sd          A.37 utt4: {C and } they're mad at the world,  /
sv          A.37 utt5: I can see where that wouldn't be very good for [ a, + a ] kid, {D you know, }  /
sd(^q)          A.37 utt6: he's coming up, will you help me with my homework  /
sd(^q)          A.37 utt7: {C and } they're, no, get away from me,  /
^q          A.37 utt8: I've had a terrible day.  /
sv          A.37 utt9: {C So, }  it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.38 utt2: that's true.  /
sd          B.38 utt3: I'm wondering with the boom down here.  /
