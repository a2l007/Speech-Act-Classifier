sd^t          A.1 utt1:  <Breathing> {D Well, } [ th-, + the ]  question was talking about the juries  /
sd          A.1 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, [ that, + especially for repeat offenders that, ] {F uh, } - /
sv          A.1 utt3: maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again.  /
sv          A.1 utt4:  {F Uh, }   {C so  that, } {F uh, } a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person [ to, + {F uh, } to ] be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Right.  /
sv         @B.2 utt2: [  I, + I ] kind of agree with that,    

o@         A.3 utt1:  <Buzz> <noise>.   *[[slash error]]

+          B.4 utt1:  because I think in some cases, {F uh, } the jury may not even have,   

+@         A.5 utt1:  <Child_talking>.   *[[slash error]]

+          B.6 utt1:  the information about other crimes the person has committed. /  

+           A.7 utt1:  Right. /   *[[slash error should be 'aa']]

sv          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case -- /  

aa          A.9 utt1:  Right <<very faint>>. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  -- {C so } a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal <laughter> --   

b          A.11 utt1:  <Child_talking> Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- there  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {C and } if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better [ pri-, + position ] to give an appropriate, {F uh, } sentencing. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa          A.13 utt2:  {D See } I agree with you.  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {F Uh, }  one thing I heard was this,  where [ they  have, +  instead of going to the regular court, they have ] [ a, + a ] mock court.  /
sd          A.13 utt4:  {E I mean, } it's supposed to be all legal and everything.  /
sd          A.13 utt5: {F Uh, }  you go  /
sd         A.13 utt6: {C and } you present your case,  /
sd         A.13 utt7: the other side presents their case  /
sd         A.13 utt8: {C and } you're done with it.  /
sd         A.13 utt9: It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.15 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] it's not that we have, {F uh, } such, - /
sd          A.15 utt2: it didn't backlog   [ or + ] all of [ the, + {F uh, } the ] cases that are, {F uh, } all ready pending.  /
%          A.15 utt3: {F Uh, }  {C so }  I, - /
sv          A.15 utt4: that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. /

qy          B.18 utt2: there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? /

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  I would tend, myself, to say that <sigh> we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases [ anytime a, + anytime [ a, + one ] ] of the parties wants one. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  {C And } [ I, + usually it is the defendant, I ] guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case. /  

b          A.25 utt1: Sure. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C So } I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, {F uh, }

sv          A.31 utt2:  {C Because, } {E I mean, } gee whiz, if I [ was, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } didn't have that right, {D you know, } not to have a jury that, {F oh } - /
sv          A.31 utt3: yes, I would feel, {F uh, } you're right, that my civil rights had been violated.  /
sv          A.31 utt4:  {C But } I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here.  /
