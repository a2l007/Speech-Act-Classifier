sv          @A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } on this subject of invasion of privacy, yes, it's very easy for anybody to find out about you.  /
%          @A.1 utt2:  Your, -/  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't really like that very much. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Yeah,  {F uh, }  /
sd          A.3 utt2: the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast, I think, last week or so ago,  it detailed how this one person went about finding  out [ this particular pers-, + from this particular person ] his home mortgage, how much he pays for it, what his payments are, {F uh, } his, {F uh, } Social Security number, driver's license, any kind of records he may have.  {F Uh, } their credit card and  the status of their credit. /  

qw          B.4 utt1:  What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff? /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  It was just as a demonstration to show --   

bk          B.6 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person.  /
%          A.7 utt2: {C And } it was, - /
sd          A.7 utt3: mostly it dealt with, {F uh, } marketing companies, these, {F uh, } direct marketing,   

b          B.8 utt1:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # /  

+          A.9 utt1:  # associations.  # /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  That was the primary subject.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  That's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets, {F uh, } their habits, their hobbies, their income. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C And } they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer. /  

ba          B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } [ that, + that's ] not really good.  /
h          B.14 utt2: I don't know,  /
sv          B.14 utt3: I guess that's an invasion of privacy.  /
sv          B.14 utt4:  I'm not sure that that's an everyday thing, though, at least not for, {D you know, } an individual. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  Something that I feel [ is  a, + is [ a, + ] ] pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now, is [ the op-, + the open ] office concept. /  

qy^m          A.17 utt1:  The open office? /  

ny          B.18 utt1: Uh-huh,  /
sd^e          B.18 utt2: where they have [ the, + {D you know, } the ] little partition dividers,   

b          A.19 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

+          B.20 utt1:  # throughout [ # a, + a ] large room  /
sd          B.20 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] people have little cubicles.  /
sv          B.20 utt3:  {D Well, } that's all fine and good,  /
sv          B.20 utt4: {C but } you don't really have any privacy at all. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  Not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody, I suppose, because [ it, + you ] can easily be [ overhear-, + overheard ]  -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.23 utt1:  -- {C and } they get, - /
sv          A.23 utt2: I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b^m          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.25 utt2: [ there's, + there is, ] -/  

sv          B.26 utt1: [  {C And, } +  {C and } ] [ it's not, + it's not ] just that,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: it's, {F uh, } the whole thing about, {D you know, } [ if, + if ] you're trying to concentrate, {D well, } it's rather hard,  /
sv          B.26 utt3: sometimes it's almost impossible to do --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- because, {F um, } {D you know, } [ [ you're, + {F uh, } you're  (( time )) ] + , you're space ] [  is, + is ] not your own space. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } I work in a situation like that  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I ] really kind of have a problem with that. /  

qy          A.31 utt1:  Do you work with, {F uh, } mixed company, male and female  /
%          A.31 utt2: {C or, } -/  

ny         B.32 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
qy          B.32 utt2:  Is there anybody who doesn't? /  

nd          A.33 utt1:  {D Well, } there are a few out there. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          A.35 utt1: [ It's, + I suppose  it ] depends on who you're working for and where at. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {C But, }  {F um, } my own environment is open totally.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  There are no cubicles.  /
sd          A.37 utt3: There's nothing to block anything. /

b          A.39 utt1:  {C So, }  yeah,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C but, }  {F um, } I guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record, /

sv          A.41 utt1:  # {C or } # the computers, [ the, + the ] big advent of that,  I believe, because [ it, + they ] can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button - /

sv          A.43 utt3: [ I, + I ] know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families. /

sv          A.45 utt1:  That's no secret,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {C and } it shouldn't be that way I don't think. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: [ I don't, + I don't ] think [ that's, + that's ] quite right either. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {E I mean } it's not really government for the people and by the people,  /
^h          A.47 utt2: I'll tell you that. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.49 utt1:  {D So, } -/  

qo          B.50 utt1:  {F Hum, } what do you think could be done about it? /  

sv          A.51 utt1:  {F Uh, } the only way it can change is, {F um, } [ if, + if ] everybody bands together.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: It's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office. /  

x          B.52 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv(^q)          A.53 utt1:  The only thing really that can be changed is for [ us to, + everybody to ] say, we've had enough of you, out you go.  /
sv          A.53 utt2:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  It has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done.  /
h          A.55 utt2: {F Um, } I don't know,  /
sv          A.55 utt3: [ it's, + it's ] still [ a, + a ]  free, I suppose, country insofar as [ we're, + we're ] able to obtain information.  /

sv          A.55 utt5: {C or, }  it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about.  /
sv          A.55 utt6: {C But } [ it's, +  it's ] hard to define --    

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.57 utt1:  -- {F uh, } a lot of those boundaries. /
