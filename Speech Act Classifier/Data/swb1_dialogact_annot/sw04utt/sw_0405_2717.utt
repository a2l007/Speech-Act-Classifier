aa          B.36 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.36 utt2: {D Well } I think in large measure the reason they don't care, - /
sv          B.36 utt3: it's not because the punishment, - /
sv          B.36 utt4: {C but } so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  The police don't catch them,  /

sd          A.39 utt4: {C and } we just had, {F uh, } a real big cocaine bust,  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } of course, {D you know, } [ they're, + they're ]  playing it up real big that  it [ was, + ] looked like it was a very, very small ring  /

sv          A.43 utt2: {C and } you have to remember  that [ [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] + {F uh, } there's, ] I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders, /  

b          B.44 utt1:  # Uh-huh <baby>.  # /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  # {C and, }  {F uh, } # once you kill off a few of them <laughter>, -/

aa          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.48 utt2: the only consolation is so many of the murders are, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.48 utt3: the, the violent people going against each other  /
%          B.48 utt4: {C and so }  they,  {D you know, } - /
sv         B.48 utt5: society's  not going to put them to death,  /
sv          B.48 utt6: {D well } at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to.  {F Uh, } - /
sv(^q)          B.48 utt7: [ I think, + I think ]  capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, {D you know, } this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society  /
^q          B.48 utt8: {C and } we are there by going to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] personally think life imprisonment,  /
sv          B.50 utt2: I don't think much [ of li-, + of life ] imprisonment.   First of all, it's never, turns out to be life,  /
qh          B.50 utt3: {C but } second, {D you know, } why should we, - /
sv          B.50 utt4: the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole.  /
sv          B.50 utt5: {D Well } that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again,  /
qh          B.50 utt6: {D well } then, why bother.  /
sv          B.50 utt7: Just execute them, because [ that's, + that ] way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv(^q)          B.52 utt1:  {C So } [ [ any, + any, ] + anybody ] that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, {F uh, } give them the death penalty <door>.  /
%          B.52 utt2: {C So, } <baby>. -/  

aa         A.53 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.53 utt2: {D you know, } it makes sense, {F um, }  {D you know,  }  /
sv          A.53 utt3: you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused,  but {E I mean, } {F uh, } so few and far between, {F uh, } {D you know, }  /
sv          A.53 utt4: makes good T V movies  /
sv          A.53 utt5: {C and } that's about it. /

sv          B.54 utt3: {C but } rather it's on <baby> the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.56 utt1:  {C And } I think our courts should be geared much more strongly <baby> towards finding out the truth than they currently are. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.58 utt1: [ {C And, } + {C and } ]  that way we can be sure, {D you know, } - /
