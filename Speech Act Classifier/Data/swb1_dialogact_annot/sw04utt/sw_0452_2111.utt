aa          B.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {D well } we have those, {F uh, } which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans.  /

ny          A.23 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C And } I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C and } you can just stop  by.  /

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  {C but } ] for aluminum that's real nice  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } I started doing that at work.  /
sd          B.26 utt3: {F Um, }  I put out [ a, + a ] trash can [ [ and, + and ] + ] for people to put their aluminum cans in, /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C and } that's really helped a lot,  /

sd          B.28 utt3: {C and, }   

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  {D you know, } it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C So, } [ I really, + I really ] like that,  /
sv          B.32 utt2: {C but, }  people are really concerned,  /
sv          B.32 utt3: it's just that sometimes it's not the right people,   

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  which is [ really, + really ] sad because, I wish we would do more <throat_clearing>.  /
sd          B.34 utt2: At work we started, {F uh, } all the recycling stuff.  /
sd          B.34 utt3:  They're really trying,  /
sd          B.34 utt4: I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } that really, started a lot of stuff off,  /
sv          B.36 utt2: {C but, }  {D you know } sometimes it dwindles down. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: where I work now we recycle all the computer paper. /  

ba          B.38 utt1:  That's good. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C But } that's about the extent of it. /

sv          B.42 utt2: it would be nice if it could be more. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  {C And } I'm sure that the, {F uh, } driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so. /  

bh          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh } do you really. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  We sell the paper back [ to the, + {F uh, } to a ] paper manufacturing company. /  

ba          B.46 utt1:  {D Well } that's a neat idea. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {D Well, } [ it, + it ] defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think.  /
%          A.47 utt2:  I, - /
sv          A.47 utt3: not by much, but it does defray it some. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building. /

ba          B.50 utt2: {E I mean } at least they're trying. /

+          A.59 utt1:  And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,  /
sd          A.59 utt2: [ I, + I ] took several home because I'm moving pretty soon  /
sd          A.59 utt3: {C and } they're good boxes. /
