sv          B.4 utt1:  {D Well, } I'm sure that, {F uh, } probably every person in this country would agree with you on that.    

x          A.5 utt1:  # <Laughter>.  #

sd          A.7 utt2: lately, I guess, {F um, } {F uh, }  or,   at least for the last twenty years or so, I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, {F uh, } defense items,  at least in the last ten years, have been, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.7 utt3: there's been  and  extraordinary amount of money spent there,  /
sv          A.7 utt4: {C and } I'm not really sure [  that, +  that ] we've gotten our money's worth there, {F uh, } regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm, {F uh, }

sd          A.11 utt1:  {F Uh, } I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the [ mi-, + military ] off and on [ over the, + over the ]  years of being called back and things of that nature, is, {F uh, }  I've found that, {D you know, } there's an extraordinary amount of waste.  /

%          A.13 utt2: {C and } I gue-, - /
sv          A.13 utt3: [ I, + I ]  should imagine [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [ what the, + what the ] problem, - /
sv          A.13 utt4: why [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a little concerned about today is that this, {F uh, } [ rather, {F uh, } quick [ and, + and ] easy, + {A I don't know,  I shouldn't say easy, }  rather quick  ] victory [ in the, + [ in, + in ] the, ] {F uh, } Mideast, {F uh, } {F uh, } over the, {F uh, } Iraqis, {F uh, } might lead us into, {F uh, } a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe.  /
sd          A.13 utt5: [ [ I'm, + I, ] +  I ] don't know what other foe that would be,  /
sd          A.13 utt6: {C but, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I'm ] just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: {D well, } of course, {F uh, } [ a lot of, + {F uh, } a lot of ] [ w-, + missiles ]  and things were expended in the course of fighting the war,  /
sd          B.14 utt3: [ {C and } the, + {C and } the ] inventory's going to have to be restocked, {F uh, }  /
%          B.14 utt4: on, - /
sd         B.14 utt5: {D now } I work for T I,  /
sd          B.14 utt6: {C and } one of the things we were told is, {D like, }  they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for,  /
sd          B.14 utt7: {C and } they used up two thousand of them [ in, + in ] the war,  /
sd          B.14 utt8: {C so } they're going to have to do another contract to restock that, to get ready in case something else is needed. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.15 utt2: {C but, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] - /
%          A.15 utt3: would that be, {F uh, } - /
%          A.15 utt4:  {D well, } let's see,  /
sd          A.15 utt5: two thousand out of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent.   {F Uh, }  /
sd          A.15 utt6: [ I, + I ] should imagine  that, that would be to keep it at  [ a level, + those levels,  ] I guess, [ that, + that ] were originally appropriated  [ [ w-, +  was ] + ] when the Soviet threat, I guess, was perceived as being a greater one.  /
sv          A.15 utt7:  I don't think there's very much of a threat there today.  /
sd          A.15 utt8: I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left [ in the territories, + {F uh, } in their territory ] over there, and who's controlling them,  /
%          A.15 utt9: {C but } <laughter>, -/  

aa          B.16 utt1: [ Tha-, + that's ] true,  /
aa^r          B.16 utt2: that's true. /  

sd          A.17 utt1: [ I, + I ] don't know [ what amount of, + what amount of, ] our hardware would stop some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, {F uh, } that would be irrational. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } of course now, we used up twenty [ per cents, + per cent ] of that inventory,   

b          A.19 utt1:  # Right.  # /  

+          B.20 utt1:  # in # a matter of just a few weeks, /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } T I also makes the missile, which was [ the, + the ]  T V laser guided bombs -- /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] a big percentage of that was expended, as well,  /
%          B.24 utt2: [ [ that n-, + that w-, ] + that was ] just a matter of, -/  

qw          A.25 utt1:  {F Oh, } what is the name of that? /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } it's called Paveway. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yes,  /
b^r          A.27 utt2: yes. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.  /
sd          B.28 utt2: {C So } [ tho-, + those ] are two areas in which T I stands [ to, + to ] gain [ some, + some ]  short term business to restock that. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.29 utt2: {D well, } {F uh, } I'm, - /
%          A.29 utt3: what I'm, - /
%          A.29 utt4: {F uh, } I guess {F uh, } it, - /
%          A.29 utt5: concerned about, - /
sv          A.29 utt6: talking about the taxes in general, and [ that, + that ] was an area that [ I, +  I ] perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for, {F uh, } in the area of defense, - /
sv          A.29 utt7: {C or } perhaps we have paid too much there,  /
h          A.29 utt8: I don't know,  /
sv          A.29 utt9: it just seems to me that over the years, now, the, - /
sv          A.29 utt10: [ {C and, } +  {C and  } ] [ it's, + it's ] a cliche,  /
%          A.29 utt11: [  I, + I, ] - /
sv          A.29 utt12: {C but } I see it myself,  /
sv          A.29 utt13: I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } no doubt. /  

h          A.31 utt1:  [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] don't know, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.31 utt2: [ I kn-, + I'm familiar with  ] [ some, + some ] upbeat school areas,  /
sd          A.31 utt3: {C so } I don't totally agree [ [ with [ the, + the ] great, + {F uh, } {F uh, } with the, ] +  with the great ] [ ex-, + expenditure ] of effort and time there,  /
sv          A.31 utt4: {C but } I guess overall, because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, [ [ and, + and, ] + {F uh, } and, ] {F uh, } rural school systems are like,  [ I, + I ] should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure. /  

aa          B.32 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: as a matter of fact, in Texas, {F um, } we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by [ the, + a ] state judge,  /
%          B.32 utt3: {C and } they, - /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C and, }  {F uh, } the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill, which, - /
sd          B.32 utt5: basically, what it does, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts, [ that are, + that [ are, + {D you know } come ] ] from local taxes --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  -- and send them to other parts of the state, that are not so affluent. /  

qy^d          A.35 utt1: [ They, + they ] don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system, /  

%          B.36 utt1:  # {F Uh, } {D well, } # -/  

qrr          A.37 utt1:  # {C or } is # it all funded out of local taxes? /  

^h          B.38 utt1:  okay,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: [ to g-, + to give ] you some perspective, [ this, + this ] town that I had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by state funds. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          B.40 utt1:  Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey, we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C but, }  they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it,  /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C and } they dumped it all on the local school districts.  /
%          B.40 utt4:  {C So, } -/  

sv          A.41 utt1:  Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Really. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  # Yeah.  # /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  # {C So, } # {C so } what ended up happening [ was, + [ was a, + was a ] ] shift.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: We went  to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years.  {C And, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } -/  

qy@          A.45 utt1:  {F Uh, } do you mean [ a, + a ] complete reversal?   

na          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ complete, + complete.  ]  /
sd          B.46 utt2:  It's all shifted to local districts,  /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C and } now, even the money that's been raised for the local districts [ is being, + is going ] to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state. /  

+@          A.47 utt1:  Because, I guess, they can't raise that money in [ those, + those ] poorer districts, {F huh? } /  

na          B.48 utt1:  That's right,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ I have, + I have ]  no problem, with, {F uh, } a certain, {F uh, } [ floor level, + minimum level, ] that's a standard --   

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- {F uh, } that everybody, {F uh, } ought to be able to have,  {F uh, }  /
sd         B.50 utt2: {C but, }  I am opposed to, [ w-, + ] any attempts to restrict, {F um, } local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yes,  /
ba          A.51 utt2: I see what you're saying.  /
sd          A.51 utt3:  {F Uh, }  [ [ [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + I do, ] + I, ] + I ]  guess I am [ a s-, + {F uh, } a strong ] and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education.  /
sd          A.51 utt4: {E I mean, } by that I mean, I'm a product myself,  /
sd          A.51 utt5: I have, {F uh, } [ [ [ a, + a, ] + a, ] + a ]  background of, {F uh, } [ being, + {F uh, } getting ]   my college education through the G I Bill. /  

sd          B.52 utt1: So did I.  /
sd         B.52 utt2: My Masters, anyway. /  

%          A.53 utt1:  What, - /
sv          A.53 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } when I look at it to me, {F uh, } it doesn't really make any difference.  /
sd          A.53 utt3: It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done,  /
sd          A.53 utt4: I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial --   

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.55 utt1:  -- {F uh, } easement made possible. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd         A.57 utt1:  {C And } [ I, + I ] don't really care what it takes to qualify, [ whether you're, {F uh, } [ an, + an ] ex-, + whether you're a veteran ] or whether you, - /
sd          A.57 utt2: I don't even know if you have to perform community service,  /
sd          A.57 utt3: {C or } unless,  {F uh, }  [ [ {C or, } +  {C or } ] + ]  you promise to even do something in the future, I think [ [  that,  {F uh, } the, + that, ] + that, the ] subsidy itself, - /
sd          A.57 utt4: {C or } I guess the enactment of that form of legislation,   

b          B.58 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          A.59 utt1:  # would # give many people who, [ [ I,  + I ] think, + I think ] I perceive the fact, - /
sd          A.59 utt2: at least what I read, is that some younger people feel that education is priced [ out of their, + {F uh, } out of their, ] {F uh, } budget.  /
sd          A.59 utt3:  I know in the state of Florida just today, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] legislature, {F uh, } adjourned,  /
sd          A.59 utt4: {C and, }  {F uh, } they had completed a fifteen per cent increase [ in the, + in the, ] {F uh, } state land grant colleges, [ which, + which ] isn't, {E I mean, } - /
sv          A.59 utt5: to me it doesn't sound like a [ mo-, + ] lot of money,  /
sv          A.59 utt6: {C but } I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /

sd          A.63 utt2: I don't know what that would be. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.64 utt2: [ they had to, + they had to ] raise, {F uh, } community college taxes here, a few years ago. /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  {C But } [ that, + {F uh, }  I guess that  ] goes along with the general idea that the federal government [ had to, + ] {F uh, } was expending so much money on defense, {F uh, } [ that, + that ] the [ program now is a, + {F uh, } program now is, ] {F uh, } - /
sv          A.65 utt2: fees [ that, + that ] fund these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states  /
