qy          A.1 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so, }  do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? /  

ng          @B.2 utt1:  Generally, I don't think they are.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2:  {F Uh, } [ my, + my ]  personal opinion is that, {F uh, } the politicians are out for their own good because [ they, + they're ] entrenched. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  They don't ever have to go out and get a real job.  /
sv          B.4 utt2: They just --   

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- stay in their current job,  /
qh          B.6 utt2: you know what I mean? /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  I agree,  {F uh,  } [  with, +  with ] both of those things,  /
qy          A.7 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest? /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  I think by putting term limitations on [ you could, + you could ] slow down some of the problems. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } it has to be not just at the national level  but at [ the, + {D you know, } the ] state and the local level, too.  /
sv          B.10 utt2:  I know some senators,  /
h          B.10 utt3: {C and } I don't know which ones,  /
sv          B.10 utt4: {C but } they've been in office since [ the, + the ] nineteen forties -- /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.12 utt1:  -- {C and }  I, - /
sv          B.12 utt2: [ th-, + they've  ] never had a job.  /
sv          B.12 utt3:  {E I mean } they've never gone out in the real world [ and, + and ] paid normal taxes. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  I know they pay taxes,  /
%          B.14 utt2: {C but } they don't -- /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  -- {D you know, }  [ they, + they ] get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year.    

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit  /
sd(^q)          B.18 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } I'm going, like, [ I, + I ] don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants  and yet they're paid more than I am -- /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  -- {C and } they work [ less, + {D you know, } less ] than I do. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

x          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv         A.23 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ the only prob-, + the only problem ] I see with term limitations, {F uh, } is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is [ in, + with ] most governments is just so complex that [ there's a very  lar-, + {D you know, } [ there, + there ] is a learning curve ]  and that, {D you know, } you [ d-, + ] can't just send someone off to Washington and expect, {D you know, } his first day to be an effective, {F uh, } Congress person.  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {F Uh, } [ I think, + I think ] [ there really is a, + there's a ] lot they need to learn, {D you know, } when you get there. /  

aa          B.24 utt1:  [ I think, + I think ] that's true,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: however,  I think that's always been true. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {E I mean, } that's true of the Presidency, too,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {C and } we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years.   /
%          B.26 utt3: {C And, }  {F uh, } -/  

b          A.27 utt1:   Yeah  /
%          A.27 utt2: {C but, } -/  

%          B.28 utt1:  They, - /
sv          B.28 utt2: {E I mean, } there  is a lot to learn,  /
sv          B.28 utt3: {C but } maybe it will keep them on their toes  and a little bit more active in trying to catch up.  /
sv          B.28 utt4:  I think two years is too short. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  I think it  (( would ))  have to be extended, {F uh, } {D you know, }  /
sv          B.30 utt2: a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms  /
sv          B.30 utt3: {C or } you would increase the length [ of the, + of each ] term of a Congressman.  /
sv          B.30 utt4:  {F Uh, } {C but } maybe standardizing [ on, + on ] [ a, + a ] four year term for Congress --   

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  -- Senate  and [ the, + the ] Presidency and then, {F uh, } staggering them so that you don't, - /
sv          B.32 utt2: we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ the other, + the other ] thing that, {F uh, } bothers me about our system is just that, {F uh, } [ [ [ [ [ in, + for, ] + for, ] + in, ] + in, ] + in ] Congress the amount of power [ any, +  any ] particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority  and how long they've been there  /
%          A.33 utt2: {C so } it's, {D you know, } for, {D you know, } {F uh, } - /
sv          A.33 utt3: {C so } unless you have actual, {D you know, } across the board [ s-, + {F uh, } limitations, ] [ the, + {F uh, } {D you know, } the ] idea of, - /
^q          A.33 utt4: {D well, } [ we're going to just, + we're,  ] - /
sv(^q)          A.33 utt5: [ I'm, + I'm  ] just going to, {D you know, } [ vote, +  vote ] against the incumbent every time doesn't work,  /
sv          A.33 utt6: {D you know, } it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.34 utt2: [ I think, + I think ] that that's true,  /
sv          B.34 utt3: {C but then } [  you  have, + you have ]  the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  {F Uh, } the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that  and for almost any agency.  /
sv          B.36 utt2: {E I mean, } the action isn't in West Virginia.  /
sd          B.36 utt3: I hate to tell [ the s-, + the senator ] from West Virginia this information,  /
sv          B.36 utt4: {C but } --   

b@          A.37 utt1:   Uh-huh <laughter>.   

+          B.38 utt1:  -- it really doesn't [ [ e-, + ar-, ] + ] - /
sv          B.38 utt2: the world does not revolve around West Virginia --    

+@          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  -- {F uh, } as far as this country is concerned,  /
sv          B.40 utt2: the world does revolve around D C, {D you know } --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- as far as the politics in this country are concerned, the national politics  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {C and } the C I A is [ a, + a ] very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia, - /
%          B.42 utt3: yeah, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.42 utt4: it might only be two hour drive from here,  but that's a two hour drive -- /  

b          A.43 utt1: Yeah. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ it, + it's a, ] + I think it's a ]  mistake to move large agencies like that -- /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

t1          B.46 utt1:  -- {C or } is it the F B I.  /
sd          B.46 utt2: I don't remember,  /
%          B.46 utt3: {C but } I think there's, -/  

%          A.47 utt1:  {D Well, } {E I mean, }  l-, - /
%          A.47 utt2: t-, - /
sv          A.47 utt3: I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, {D you know, } officially [ they don't do, + they don't have ] any operations within the United States other than administrative. /  

aa          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.48 utt2: that's officially. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {E I mean, } we all know that that's not necessarily true.  /
sv          B.50 utt2: {C But } [ I, + I ]  think that [ there are, + there are ] advantages to having seniority [ and, + {F uh, } [ turn-, + ] or,  ] not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years.  /
sv          B.50 utt3:  I think [ there are, + {E I mean } there's ] an  institutional memory that you need to maintain. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  {C But } I think that, {F uh, } [ all, + with all ]  the perks that we've given them, - /
sd          B.52 utt2: {E I mean, } I heard on the radio back [ a, + a ]  few weeks ago, {F uh, } during the incidents where [ they were, + {D you know, } {D like } they aren't ]  paying [ their, + their ] restaurant bills  /
sd          B.52 utt3: {C and } --   

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  -- they're bouncing checks all over the place -- /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  -- {F uh, } one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks. /
