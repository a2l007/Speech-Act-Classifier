qw          B.2 utt1:  [ What, + what ] changes do you think have taken place in the last generation? /  

sv          A.3 utt1:  I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  Few are, {F uh, } basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.6 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.6 utt3: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] grew up in, {F uh, } sixties and early seventies  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C and, }  {F uh, } my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.  /
sd          B.6 utt5: She didn't start working until I was, {F um, } well into high school. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {C So, } [ I, + I ] had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays [ kids, + it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids. ] /

sd          B.20 utt4: women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years  /
sv          B.20 utt5: {C and now } they're wanting to go back to the old days where, {D you know, } women stayed home with the kids, {D you know, } and  try to give the kids quality time. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {C And } [ [ I, + I think that in the future you're, ] + I think you're ] going to see a lot more, {F um, } women choosing to not work after they have a baby. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  {F Um, } I think [ with, {F uh, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] work force + with [ the, + the ] salaries ] that - /
sd          B.24 utt2: [ a lot of, + a lot of ] the women that I work for have husbands who are, {F um, } vice-presidents of companies  /
sv          B.24 utt3: {C and } I think with, {F uh, } {F um, } this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people, /  

b          A.25 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  # {F um, } # I don't see it as much, [ the, + ] like in my situation where [ I don't, + I don't ] have children yet,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C but } ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids.   /
sv          B.26 utt3: {C But } realistically [ that's, + [ I'm, + I'm realizing that's ] ] probably not going to be possible, {F um, } for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income. /  

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.27 utt2: that is tough.  /
aa          A.27 utt3: Yeah,  /
sd          A.27 utt4: we're looking at that now,  /
sd          A.27 utt5: my wife's about six months along. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.28 utt2: I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  {D You know, } it's going to [ kind of + <throat_clearing> kind of ] go along with the B M W in the driveway [ and, + or ] in the garage or whatever. /  

ba          A.31 utt1:  True. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.  /
sv          A.33 utt3:  I would think it would be women that were working full-time. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.34 utt2: believe it or not though [ the, + all the ] women that stay home are real busy when they are home. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  {F Um, } they're real active in volunteer work. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {F Um, } one of the women is real active with, {F uh, } Muscular Dystrophy.  And, {F uh, } does a lot [ of, + of ] work with them on a volunteer basis  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {C but } [ it's still, + it's almost ] like a job,  /

sv          A.39 utt1:  {F Huh. }  {D Well, } I guess that's good that [ they, + they've ] got something to keep them active. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Yeah.  /

qo          A.43 utt2:  <<Very faint>> What do you think? /  

%          B.44 utt1:  [ [ That, +  that, ] + that,  ] - /

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: we think it's, {F uh, } that important  /
sd          A.45 utt3: {C and } [ I, + I ] kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.  /
sd          A.45 utt4: I'm [ a, + a ] counselor and a therapist, /  

b          B.46 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  # {C and } # I work with adolescents,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {C and } I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.48 utt2: [ I, + I ] see a difference in [ the generation of, + even the generation ] before me,

+          B.50 utt1:  # {F uh, } # were, {D you know, } mom was like, {F um, } [ Mrs Cleaver, + {F uh, } {D you know, } June  Cleaver ] or whatever,  /
sv          B.50 utt2: where [ the, + the ] attitudes were a lot different.  /
sv          B.50 utt3:  {F Um, } as far as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more, - /
sv          B.50 utt4: {F um, } [ ther-, + there ] wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,    

b          A.51 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          B.52 utt1:  # {F um, } # a lot of [ the, + the ] things that are going on in today's society,  /
sv          B.52 utt2: I think morally, {F um, } it seems like [ there was, peo-, + people were ] a lot better back then as far as [ hig-, + higher ] standards. /  

ba          A.53 utt1:  True.  /
sv          A.53 utt2: {D Well, } the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure  /
sv          A.53 utt3: {C and } with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  {C So, } kids are raised around their friends and by the media. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.56 utt2: that's true. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  {C And } [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ] contributed, /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {C And } [ I think, + I think ] you're going to see a lot more of that in the future. /  

aa          A.59 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.59 utt2: maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,  /
sv          A.59 utt3: {C so. } If there was some way [ for, + for ] women [ to, + to ] stay home even if they could work, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.59 utt4: there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,   

b          B.60 utt1:  # Uh-huh.  # /  

+          A.61 utt1:  # and # those types of things, that would at least in some ways, {F um, } bridge the gap <<pause>>. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.62 utt2: [ I, + I ] think that, {F um, } in the future, {F um, } [ the, + the ] family unit [ as it, + as it ] once was known, [ is, + is ] going to be nonexistent <<pause>>.  /
qo          B.62 utt3: [ What, + [ how do you, + what do you think? ] ] /  

qw^h          A.63 utt1:  About? /

qrr          B.64 utt3: [ {C or, } + {C or } ] do you think that, {F um, } the trend is going more towards single parenting? /

%          A.65 utt2: I don't, - /
sd          A.65 utt3: [ the, + the ] divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so  /
sd          A.65 utt4: {C and } it got higher than that for a while.  /
sv          A.65 utt5: {F Um, } that's hard to say.  /
sv          A.65 utt6: Families are such a strange configuration anymore.  /
sd          A.65 utt7: {F Um, } [ I, + I ] see a lot of families where, - /

sv          A.69 utt2: [ kids don't, + kids are bombarded ] with all kinds of junk  /
sv          A.69 utt3: {C and } one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.  /
sv          A.69 utt4:  They get bombarded with junk  /
sv          A.69 utt5: {C and } they don't have to do anything around the house.  /

sv          A.71 utt1:  # the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while - /
sv          A.71 utt2: {C and } they come back,  /

b          B.74 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.75 utt1:  {C So. } It's [ not, + not ] a real functional situation anyway.   /
sd          A.75 utt2: {C So, } {D you know, } [ I don't know it's, + I don't know ] that that trend's going to change the single parent type families  /
sv          A.75 utt3: {C and } the  ((   ))  families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.76 utt2: [ I, + I ] think that eventually [ the, + the ] family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.  /
sv          B.76 utt3:  ((   ))  like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, {F um, } {D you know, } two parent families. /
