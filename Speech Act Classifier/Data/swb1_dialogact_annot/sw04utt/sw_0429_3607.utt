sd          @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } done a little, {F uh, } repair on the, {F uh, } shingles on the roof recently.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: We've had a lot of wind around here. /  

qrr          A.3 utt1:  Been pulling them up, {F huh, } or just loosening them until the rain came in? /  

ny          B.4 utt1:  Yes.  /
sd^e          B.4 utt2:  It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again, because we may have a leak. /  

qy          A.5 utt1:  Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain? /  

nd          B.6 utt1:  We've been getting quite a bit,  maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio,  /
%          B.6 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } {D well, } I'm right, - /
sd          B.6 utt3:   Plano's just north of Dallas -- /  

bk          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  -- {C and } there are parts of downtown  or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now, I guess,  /

ng          B.14 utt2: So far we haven't had any today.  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I suppose that means I should be, {F uh, } getting up there to look at that, {F uh, } shingle,  /
sd          B.14 utt4: {C but, }  {F uh } --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- I had something else planned today,  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

qr          A.21 utt1:  Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them? /

sd^e          B.22 utt3:   {F uh, } as a matter of fact, we've never had a leak actually yet.  /
%          B.22 utt4: Now this, - /
sd          B.22 utt5: we just bought the house last year,  /
sd          B.22 utt6: {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles.  /
sd          B.22 utt7:  {C So, }  I've just recently had to start looking at it myself. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C So, }  it's a small problem so far,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: {C but } I guess you just have to keep on top of it.  /
qw          B.24 utt3: What kind of roof do you have? /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {F Uh, } we're in, {F uh, } campus apartment buildings with flat top, {F uh. } /  

qy^d          B.26 utt1:  {F Oh, } then you don't have to do too much with it <laughter>. /  

ng          A.27 utt1:  Not too much.  /
sd          A.27 utt2: They're just tar and gravel --

sd          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } it's pretty steep.  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {F Uh, } parts of it are steeper than others. /  

qw          A.31 utt1:  What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal? /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } <laughter> you wear, {F uh, } shoes with good traction, [ [ and,  + and, ] +  and ] try to remember where you are at all times <laughter>. /

qy          A.37 utt5:  [ was, + was ] the house reasonably new,  /

sv          B.40 utt5:  {C but } just take good care of it. /  

b          A.41 utt1: Yeah. /  

%          B.42 utt1:  Thing is, - /
sd          B.42 utt2: [ we've, + {F uh, } the main thing that we've ] had with this house recently has been some, {F uh, } squirming, I call it, of the foundation.  /
sd          B.42 utt3:  We're just on a concrete slab, {D you know } -- /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } the soil right under this is a clay,  /

qy          A.45 utt1:  It's settling unevenly? /  

nd          B.46 utt1:  {D Well, } [ it, + {F uh, } depending on it's ] moisture content, it either swells up or  shrinks,  /

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot  longer -- /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  -- {C and so } during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation [ from, + {F uh, } from, ] {F uh, } drooping -- /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ]  anytime there's a change in the weather, like the temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, {F uh, } moisture, {F uh, } you get little spider web cracks all around, {F uh, } windows and doors. /  

sv          A.53 utt1:  {D Well, } that sounds like a lot of fun. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {D Well, } usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C and  then } you patch them up <laughter>. /  

qy          A.55 utt1:  {F Um. }  What is it {D like, } {F uh, } stucco walls  or, -/
