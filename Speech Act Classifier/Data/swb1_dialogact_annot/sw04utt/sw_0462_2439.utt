o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qw          A.1 utt2: {D so } what kind of cars are you looking at? /  

sd          @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ we've, + {F uh, } we've, ] + we've ] test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight  --   

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac, about three or four years old  --   

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- because, {F uh, } I get married in a couple of weeks  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } I have two kids  /
sd          B.6 utt3: {C and } my fiancee has two kids  -- /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  -- {C so } we need a car that's big enough for six. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah <laughter> <<pause>>. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C And so } [ we went, + {A I guess it was two weekends ago, } we went, ] {F uh, } car shopping --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- and looked around.  /
sd          B.12 utt2: We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway -- /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  -- that, {F uh, } <<pause>> in addition to getting a new car there, they can get you a car that's new  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C but } it's been, {F uh, } a demonstrator model --   

bk          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {C So, }  they call this program cars,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C and } they come,   

x          A.19 utt1:  <Cough>.   

+          B.20 utt1:  with a new car warranty,  /
sv          B.20 utt2: {C and } it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that. /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  Right.  /
ba          A.21 utt2:  That's a real good deal.  /
sd          A.21 utt3: In fact my dad recently got [ a, + {F um, } a ] Pontiac, {F uh, } believe six thousand -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  -- {C and } he got a demo. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And } it's been a real good car -- /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  -- {C and } [  it's, + it's ] like new -- /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  -- {C and } it only [ had, + had ] [ very, + very ] low mileage on it. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  {C And so } I think he got a real good deal.  /
sv          A.31 utt2:  Of course, they're fully loaded usually. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {C So } [ it's, + I think it's ] a pretty good option. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: I think so too. /  

qy          A.35 utt1:  Are the, {F uh, } Oldsmobiles that you're looking at, are they the demos  /
qrr          A.35 utt2:  {C or } they used,  /
qy         A.35 utt3: are they new <laughter>. /  

na          B.36 utt1:  {D Well, } the ones that we were test driving [ were the, + {F uh, } were the ] new ones --   

b          A.37 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.38 utt1:  -- # there. #  /
%          B.38 utt2: Uh-huh.  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {D Well } [ now, + {F uh, } <<pause>> now, ] they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. <<pause>>  /
qy^d          A.39 utt2: {C And then } the Cadillac [ is, + is ] definitely a used car  /
%          A.39 utt3: {C or, } -/  

ny          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.  /
sd          B.42 utt2:  He says it'll probably be gone in a done,  /
sd          B.42 utt3: {C and } it's probably gone by now. /  

ba          A.43 utt1:  {D Oh } no <laughter>. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  Those things go fast. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {F Uh, } of course [ we're not, + we can't ] consider getting a brand new Cadillac, because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {C But } when they're three years old they're, - /
sv          B.48 utt2: the price already drops in half. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {C So then } it becomes, {F uh, } more realistic. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.51 utt2: That's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new -- /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qh          A.53 utt1:  -- {C or } do I look for a used car that's maybe [ two, + three ] years old [ that  -- +    

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.55 utt1:  -- but that's, ] {D you know, } low mileage and in good shape.  /
sd          A.55 utt2:  {C But } [ I just, +  I ] kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it.  /
qh          A.55 utt3:  Is it a lemon,  /
qh          A.55 utt4: [ {C or } + <laughter>,   

aa          B.56 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.57 utt1:  {C or } ] is something wrong with it  /
sv          A.57 utt2: {C but } --   

aa          B.58 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  -- I guess that's a risk you have to take. /  

sv          B.60 utt1:  {D Well, } you can reduce that risk by, {F uh, } having the car checked out,  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {E I mean, } {D you know, } if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this -- /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  -- {C but } if you've narrowed it down to one or two --   

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.64 utt1:  -- you can have the car, {F uh, } {F uh, } checked at, {F uh, } an independent service station --   

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.66 utt1:  -- and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong, because they don't have any financial interest in it. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.68 utt1:  {C And then } you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting. /  

aa          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qw          A.69 utt2: About how much do they charge to do something like that,  /
qy          A.69 utt3: do you know? /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  {F Oh, } I'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.71 utt2: that's not bad. /  

aa          B.72 utt1:  No,  /
aa          B.72 utt2: huh-uh. /  

sv          A.73 utt1:  It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car <laughter>.    

aa          B.74 utt1: [  I would, + I would ] think so. /  

+          A.75 utt1:  to find out. /  

aa          B.76 utt1:  I would think so. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.77 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.77 utt3: {D Well, } it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago,  /
%          A.77 utt4: {C and } I, -/  

qy          B.78 utt1:  Isn't that a good feeling. /  

ny          A.79 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          A.79 utt2: I don't want to think about buying a car for a while.  /
sd          A.79 utt3: I just want to enjoy <hum> not having any car payments for a while --    

aa          B.80 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.81 utt1:  -- and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and, {F uh, } {D you know, } hang on to the one I've got for a few years because [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] almost four years old,  /
sd          A.81 utt2: {C but } it's still in great shape.  /
sd          A.81 utt3:  I have a Mazda R X seven. /  

ad          B.82 utt1:  {D Well, } what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years -- /  

aa          A.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ad          B.84 utt1:  -- {C and } when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it. /  

aa          A.85 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.85 utt2: I just about could really --    

b          B.86 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.87 utt1:  -- because I think my car, - /
sv          A.87 utt2: if I continue taking good care of it, it's going to hold a pretty good resale value -- /  

b          B.88 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sv          A.89 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } if I consider going the used car route and save up some money, I shouldn't have too much trouble at all. /

aa          B.90 utt2: [ I, + I ] would think that's true. /  

ad          A.91 utt1:  Could you hold on for just a moment? /  

aa          B.92 utt1:  Sure. /

sd^c          A.93 utt2:  I'm on a cordless phone,  /

sd^c          A.93 utt4: {C so } I just switched the channel up on it.  /
sd^c          A.93 utt5: I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record. /

b          B.110 utt1:  Yeah,  /

b          A.111 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

ba          A.113 utt1:  Wow. /  

+          B.114 utt1:  -- and got a hundred and sixty-one thousand out of it. /

b          A.117 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.118 utt1:  {C So } [ that, + that's ] kind of in the way  I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever. /

+          B.136 utt1:  -- to keep the monthly payment low. /

sv          A.139 utt1:  That's probably the best thing. /

sd^e          A.143 utt2:  When I bought my R X seven, [ I, + ] {F uh, } best offer I got for my other car was twenty-five hundred.  /
sd          A.143 utt3: {D Well } I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred.  /
%          A.143 utt4:  {C So, } -/  

ba          B.144 utt1:  {F Oh } there you go. /  

sv          A.145 utt1:  You can do much better.  /
sd          A.145 utt2:  I'm glad [ you're, + you're ] taking care of it yourself.  /
sv          A.145 utt3: [ I, + I ] think trading it in, they just use that as additional, - /
sv          A.145 utt4: they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying,  /
sv          A.145 utt5: {C but } they just, are going to give you that much less for your trade in. /  

ba          B.146 utt1:  {F Well } that's fact. /  

sd          A.147 utt1:  What I think.   /
%          A.147 utt2: {C So, } -/  

aa          B.148 utt1:  I think you're right. /  

sd          A.149 utt1:  {C But }  strangely enough, [ the best off-, + {E I mean, } the best bargaining ] I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price --   

ba          B.150 utt1:  Interesting. /  

+          A.151 utt1:  -- trade in,  /
sd          A.151 utt2: {C but } it's a place in Arlington,  /
sd          A.151 utt3: {C and } I think, maybe, as you get outside the Dallas area,  /
%          A.151 utt4: I kind of, - /
sv          A.151 utt5: I bet you it's kind of what I decided.  /
sv          A.151 utt6: {D Well, } maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices,  /
sd          A.151 utt7: {C plus } I was going through that T I fleet discount program. /  

b          B.152 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy          B.152 utt2: [ did, + did ] you use it at the car shop place. /  

nd          A.153 utt1:  {D Well, } it's before they had that. /  

bk          B.154 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          A.155 utt1:  I had gone over to Texins  /
sd          A.155 utt2: {C and } they had a little file where they said which dealers participated [ in the, + in the ] fleet program, /  

aa          B.156 utt1:  That's right,  /
aa          B.156 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.157 utt1:  {C and } what you could expect, they said, {D you know, } a five percent over cost --   

b          B.158 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.159 utt1:  -- and then options at cost and everything. /  

b          B.160 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.161 utt1:  {C So, }  I figured out a price based on that. /  

b          B.162 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          B.162 utt2: that's good. /  

sd          A.163 utt1:  {C But } [ I, + I ] guess I got a pretty good deal, because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central --   

b          B.164 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.165 utt1:  -- and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington -- /  

b          B.166 utt1:  Right. /  

sd(^q)          A.167 utt1:  -- {C and } they said there is no way you can get this car for that price, especially if we add on the equalizer --   

b          B.168 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.169 utt1:  -- and the cruise control. /  

b          B.170 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          A.171 utt1:  He said, You're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage.  /
sd          A.171 utt2: {C And } they just laughed at me.  /
sd          A.171 utt3: {C And } I went the next morning to Arlington,  /
sd          A.171 utt4: {C and } they gave it to me for that price.  /
sd          A.171 utt5: {C And } what's so funny,  /
sd          A.171 utt6: they took the car, [ they, + I knew they ] were going to pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was. /  

b          B.172 utt1:  Is that right. /  

sd(^q)          A.173 utt1:  {C And } they had already told me, We located one at Town North.  /
sd          A.173 utt2: {C So } it was that same car. /  

ba          B.174 utt1:  My gosh. /  

b          A.175 utt1:  Yeah,  /
^q          A.175 utt2: {D well, } unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage <laughter>, I got the car off your lot for that price <laughter>. /  

qy^d          B.176 utt1:  {C And } you laughed all the way to the bank. /  

na          A.177 utt1:  {F Oh } I did.  /
sd          A.177 utt2: {C And } I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup -- /  

b          B.178 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.179 utt1:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } that they required you to do.  /
sd          A.179 utt2: {C And } I took it to Town North,  /
sd          A.179 utt3: {C and } sure enough I saw that guy,  /
sd          A.179 utt4: {C and } he recognized me. /  

b          B.180 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          A.181 utt1:  He said, {F Oh, } hi, Dana,  /
sd          A.181 utt2: {C and } he kind of looked down and saw that car,  /
sv          A.181 utt3: {C and } I'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day -- /  

b          B.182 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.183 utt1:  -- of course, when the place in Arlington went and took the car --   

aa          B.184 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.185 utt1:  -- because I told him there's a place in Arlington that's going to give it to me for that price.  /
sd(^q)          A.185 utt2:  He said, No they're not. /  

b          B.186 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.187 utt1:  {C And } the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington.  /
sv          A.187 utt2:  {C So } I'm sure he knew <laughter>. /  

ba          B.188 utt1:  Such a deal. /  

sd          A.189 utt1:  {D So } I loved it.  /
sd          A.189 utt2: I sat there,  /
sd          A.189 utt3: {C and } I just had the biggest grin on my face. /  

ba          B.190 utt1:  I'll bet you did. /  

sd          A.191 utt1:  It was kind of nice. /
