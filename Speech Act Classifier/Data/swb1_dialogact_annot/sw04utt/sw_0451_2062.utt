%          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } personally, {D you know, } I think, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.2 utt2: of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package  /
sv          B.2 utt3: {C and } I think that, {F uh, } we've probably got one of the best around, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.2 utt4: besides, they tend to offer [ ad-, + adequate ] vacation, I guess.   /
sv          B.2 utt5: {C And } the paid time off is wonderful,  /
sd          B.2 utt6: {C and, }  {F uh, } one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered  /
sv          B.2 utt7: {C and } I think that is just [ a, + a ] fabulous one,  /
qy^d          B.2 utt8: {C so. } I don't know if you participate in that or not,  /
%          B.2 utt9: {C but } -- -/

qy          B.4 utt1:  -- isn't it great?  <laughter>  /
sv          B.4 utt2: [ It's just a, + it's just a ] miracle [ that + ] how fast that adds up, {D you know. } /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  {D Well, } I have to agree with that.  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {D You know, } I was thinking about, {F uh, } importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary --   

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- while I was waiting for, {F uh, } the system to find [ a, + a ] respondent. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C And } I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed  /
sv          A.9 utt2: {C and } I suspect that that's probably true for everyone. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  When I was much younger it was, {F uh, } less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C But } as I grow older and my family grows, [ it, + the medical benefits ] are more important  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {C and } the retirement is more important. /  

ba          B.12 utt1:  I had never really thought of it that way  /
aa          B.12 utt2: {C but } [ I guess that's true, +  I guess that's  true. ]  /
sd          B.12 utt3: I'm still young enough [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } the vacation's real important to me  /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C and } the paid time off is real important to me [ and, + and ] that kind of thing.  /
sd          B.12 utt5: {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I was just, + as a matter of fact, I just, ] {F uh, } celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, {F uh, } kind of started looking through [ the, + the ] book because of that, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.12 utt6: now that I'm a hundred percent vested, {D you know, } you kind of look through the book and see {D well, } [ what exactly, + what ] does that mean and what is the pension all about  /
%          B.12 utt7: {C and, } {D you know, } [ when you're, + when you're, ] {D you know, } in your, - /
sd          B.12 utt8: I'm only in my late   twenties now,  /
sd          B.12 utt9: {C so } you tend not to think about retirement.  /
%          B.12 utt10: {C But, }  {F uh, } it's, - /
sd          B.12 utt11: I guess now is the time to think about it,  /
qy          B.12 utt12: {C so. }  Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think? /  

na          A.13 utt1:  I think they have, {F uh, } [ a-, + one ] that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And } that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, {F uh, } CODA Plan. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  It's --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- certainly [ a, + a ] supplemental way, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.19 utt2: {C and } I suppose [ [ if, + b-, ] + maybe ]  [ in, + in ] your instance, [ if, + if ] you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C But } I had another career first  and then came to T I a little later. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.23 utt1:  {C So } it's not, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.23 utt2: all by itself it won't be adequate [ for, +   

sd          B.24 utt1:  It's not going to build up,   

+          A.25 utt1:  for  ] my situation. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  quite enough,  /
aa          B.26 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C So, }  I have to find a way to supplement that. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.28 utt2: {D Well, } [ they just, + they seem ] to make it so easy to save.  /
%          B.28 utt3:  {D You know, } one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world, - /
sd          B.28 utt4: {C but } I've got money coming out  ((   ))  to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.  /
sv          B.28 utt5: {C And } it's probably not a great investment,  /
sd          B.28 utt6: {C but } if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, {D you know. }  /
sd          B.28 utt7: I kind of have to trade off, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.28 utt8:  If you never see it you don't spend it,  /
%          B.28 utt9: [ {C so  } + <laughter>.  {C And } ] it's, -/  

ba          A.29 utt1:  I [ unders-, + understand ] though,  /
%          A.29 utt2: it, -/  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {F Uh, } believe me, I do that myself. /  

bh          B.32 utt1:  Do you?  /
bh          B.32 utt2:  Yeah? /  

ar          A.33 utt1:  {C And } I disagree with you.  /
sd          A.33 utt2: I don't think it's the worst investment,   

bh          B.34 utt1: Do you really not? /  

+          A.35 utt1:  in the world. /  

sd          B.36 utt1: [ [ [ I, + I, ] + [ fr-, + ]  {D you know, } I, ] + I ] debate about whether it's really good or not, {D you know. } /  

%          A.37 utt1:  {D Well, } it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment - /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C and } maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed,   

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  until later. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {F Uh, } it's shown a history that, {F uh, } sure beats anything else.    

aa          B.42 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.42 utt2: that's true.  /
aa          B.42 utt3: That's very true. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  Over many, many years. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  We went, {F uh, } and did [ a, + a ] thing through I B S which is [ a, + {D like } a ] financial consultant <noise> type thing here in Dallas  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, </noise> {D you know, } - /
sd          B.44 utt3: they work up this whole big, {D you know, } [ proposal, + profile ] for you, [ that, + ] [ ev-, + all ] the things that you need to work on  and you need to do.  /
sd          B.44 utt4: {C And then } one of the things that we talked about with her was, {D you know, } the need to save for our son's education.  /
sd          B.44 utt5:  We have a two year old, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.44 utt6: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.44 utt7: we have to do that now.  /
sd          B.44 utt8: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] {F uh, } they have a way that they can figure, {D you know, } what, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.44 utt9:  {C and } he's two now,  /
sd          B.44 utt10: in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.44 utt11: {C and } it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to, - /
sd          B.44 utt12: [ it's, + what it ] costs now is ridiculous,  /
sd          B.44 utt13: what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.  /
sd          B.44 utt14:  {C And } they sat down and  figured up that we needed to save {D like } between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, {F oh, } {D you know, } six percent interest rate, to be able to have, {D you know, } money for his college.  /
sd          B.44 utt15: {C And } that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, [ is, + is, ] {D you know, } about fifteen hundred dollars a year.  /
%          B.44 utt16: {C So, }  I guess it, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.44 utt17: in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, {D you know. }  /
sd          B.44 utt18: [ We, + we ] can worry about other things  /
