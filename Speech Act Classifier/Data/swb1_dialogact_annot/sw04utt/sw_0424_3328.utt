sd          B.2 utt2:  they raise ours it seems {D like }  constantly.  /
sd          B.2 utt3:  We just, {F uh, } passed a new one, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.2 utt4: fortunately or unfortunately  it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  {F Oh, } right  /
qy^g          A.3 utt2: Indianapolis got that, didn't they? /  

na          B.4 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C And, }  {F uh, } we had passed [ a, + a ]  provisional one that  [ [ if, + if it did, ] + if they did ] locate here we would raise our taxes.  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C But, }  {F uh, } at least we thought we'd get something back from that. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qo          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } how do you feel about taxes? /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } it seems like a big politics game  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {D like }  up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C so } he said the budget was fine,  /
sd          A.7 utt4:  the state didn't have any money  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C and then } right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money  /
sd          A.7 utt6: {C so } they raised all our taxes. /  

x          B.8 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C And } now it's election time again  /
sd          A.9 utt2:  {C so } they're trying to lower them. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C So } they're just talk about lowering them  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  {C but } they never do,  /
sd          A.11 utt3: they just keep raising them. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  I've never seen taxes really go down. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: me neither.   /
sd          A.13 utt3:  {D Well, } actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C so } they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year  /
sd          A.13 utt5: {C and } they're going to lower it for next year. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Oh. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  I hope they put that in writing <laughter>. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:   Yeah,  /
aa^r          A.17 utt2: <laughter> yeah,  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  they say they're going to lower,  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C but } I'll see. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation   and, {F uh, } that the rich are not paying their share  /
sv          B.18 utt2:  {C and } of course the poor can't afford it either,  /
%          B.18 utt3: {C but, }  {F uh, } I really feel like - /
%          B.18 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ]  I feel like, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.18 utt5: I'm a middle class person income wise anyway  /
sd          B.18 utt6: {C and, }  {F uh, } I get tired of supporting the whole country. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: so do I.  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {E I mean, } I'm [ [ a, + a ] + ]  middle class barely,  /
sv          A.19 utt4: {C but, }  {F uh, } I don't think the rich are paying [ [ mo-, + less, ] + not enough, ]  /
sv          A.19 utt5: I think they're paying too much. /  

qy          B.20 utt1:  You think the rich are paying too much? /  

ny          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^e          A.21 utt2: {E I mean } if you're in [ the, +  the ] [ three, + three ] percent bracket  and they take a third of your check every month, {D well, } that's ridiculous.  /
qh          A.21 utt3:  Why bother working? /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to, - /
sd          B.22 utt2: {E I mean, } I'm talking about the really rich. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {D Well, } they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  That would be fair. /  

aa          B.26 utt1:  {D Now } I'll go along with that.    

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah -- /  

+          B.28 utt1:  {D You know, } /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  -- no loopholes or anything.  /
sv          A.29 utt2: Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or  whatever. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          B.30 utt2: {D Now, } I think that would be fair. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.32 utt1:  {C And } I, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.32 utt2: [ no, + no ]  ifs, ands and buts, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.32 utt3: no big elaborate laws that [ say, + {F uh, } {D you know, } call  ] for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.  /
sv          B.32 utt4: It's just, {D you know, } you make this,  you pay ten percent.  /
sv          B.32 utt5:  If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,  /
sv          B.32 utt6: if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: that's the way our state tax is here.  /
sv          A.33 utt3:  I think it's pretty fair. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they have not gotten it <breathing> where the withholding is accurate. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Oh <laughter>. /  

sd          B.38 utt1: [ [  {C So, } + {C and, } ] +  {C and } ]  you withhold no matter what you do,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough. /  

ba          A.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } great,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C so } you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Right,  /
sd(^q)          B.40 utt2: {C so } now, {D you know, } when you sign your [ W-Four form or whatever, + W-Two --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- whatever ] that is, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state.    

x          A.43 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.44 utt1:  Which is ridiculous,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C but } it's been that way for the last probably ten years. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: I guess you have to check yes  /
sv          A.45 utt3: {C or } you come down to the end of the year  /
sv          A.45 utt4: {C and } you don't have it to give it to them. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: unless you have a lot of deductions. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {C But, } {D you know, } if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise. /  

bh          A.49 utt1:  Really? /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {C And } you end up owing, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.50 utt2:  you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal  /
sv          B.50 utt3: {C and } you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state. /  

ba          A.51 utt1:  Ouch <laughter>. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ]  just ridiculous.  /
h          B.52 utt2:  {C But, } [  I, + I ] don't know.  /
%          B.52 utt3:  I've, - /
sd          B.52 utt4: they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property [ in, + in ] Oklahoma county and that is a chunk. /  

aa          A.53 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.53 utt2: I'll say <laughter>. /
