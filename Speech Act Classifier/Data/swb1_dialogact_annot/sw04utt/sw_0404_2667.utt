sd          B.94 utt2: I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,  /
sv          B.94 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } it's silly not to,  /
h          B.94 utt4: {C but, }  I don't know,  /
sv          B.94 utt5: it's just a put off.  /
sd          B.94 utt6: I don't know why I don't do more,  /
sd          B.94 utt7: [ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] know that it's good for my health.  /
sd          B.94 utt8:  I know,  {D you know, } from everything that you read  and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health. /  

b          A.95 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.96 utt1:  {C So, } {D you know, } [ you, not only, + {D you know, } you're not  only ] doing something to keep yourself fit,  but you're probably prolonging your life.  /

sv          A.99 utt1:  It's just hard to make yourself go.  /
sd          A.99 utt2: {C And } [ I, + I ] think one thing I don't like  about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,  /
sd          A.99 utt3: {C and } I've been sweaty,  /
%          A.99 utt4: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  it,  {D you know, } - /
sd          A.99 utt5: I  don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands. /  

b          B.100 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.101 utt1:  {C So } it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.  /
sd          A.101 utt2: {C So } I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better. /  

b          B.102 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.103 utt1:  Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes <laughter>, because you've already kind of shot your night. /  

b          B.104 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.105 utt1:  {C But, }  {F um, } {C so } I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on [ Tuesday, + Thursday ] now that I can just kill two nights, [ and -- +   

b          B.106 utt1:  Yeah. /

nn          A.109 utt1:  No,  /

ba          B.110 utt1:  {D Well, } that's good, too. /  

sd          A.111 utt1:  This one was only forty-five dollars.  /
sd          A.111 utt2: {C But } I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably. /  

b          B.112 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.112 utt2: yeah. /  

sd(^q)          A.113 utt1:  Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money,  you'd better go <laughter>. /

b          B.120 utt1:  Yeah,  /

ba          B.122 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.123 utt1:  {C And } they have ceiling fans in the rooms,  /
sd          A.123 utt2: {C and } [ it's, + it's ]  a pretty nice setup.  {F Um, }  /
sd          A.123 utt3: {C and } of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.  /
sd          A.123 utt4:  I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it. /  

b          B.124 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.125 utt1:  {C And } just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to [ the, + the ] recreation center and do it helps a lot. /  

aa          B.126 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          B.126 utt2: Yeah,  /

sd          A.129 utt5: {C and } I guess guys can take advantage of that.  /
