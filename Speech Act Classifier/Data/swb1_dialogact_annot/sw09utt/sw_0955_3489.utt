o          A.1 utt1:   Okay, Jerry,  /
sd^t          A.1 utt2: I guess tonight's topic is about recycling. /  

b          @B.2 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:   {C And } I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community --

+          A.5 utt1:   -- here in Plano.  /
sd          A.5 utt2:  Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up [ by the, + by the ] collection agency or [ the, + the ] city along with your garbage can.  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {F Uh, } you can put out newspaper,  /
sd          A.5 utt4: you can put out glass,  /
sd          A.5 utt5: you can put out aluminum cans,  /
sd          A.5 utt6: you can [ put, + put ] out certain types of plastic material  /
sd          A.5 utt7: {C and } that is on a roll out effort right now.  /
sd          A.5 utt8: Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, {F uh, } participate right now,  /
sd          A.5 utt9: {C but, } {F uh, } that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so.  /
sd          A.5 utt10: {C And } those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum.  /
sv          A.5 utt11: {C And } I think, {F uh, } overall that's [ an, + an ] excellent opportunity  /
sd          A.5 utt12: {C because } I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, {F uh, } growing bigger and bigger and  bigger where they are becoming a big problem for [ o-, + not only ] the people that are living today, but for the future also.  /

b          A.13 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:   {C And } it's not a city, <lipsmack> not incorporated,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, /  

x          A.15 utt1:   <Laughter>.   

sd          B.16 utt1:   I can't even see their house  /
%          B.16 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } -/

ba          A.25 utt1:   {D Well, } good. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:   I'm building our house right now  /

b          A.27 utt1:   {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:   {C So } when I drive the car [ in the, + in the ] driveway in the afternoon, [ it, + it ] will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } pressure side of a, {F uh, } hydraulic cylinder. /  

b          A.29 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:   {C And } the weight of the car will crush,

sd          B.38 utt1:   {D Well, } I thought [ I'd, + {D you know, } I'd ] use it as [ a, + an ] escapement type thing.  /
qy^d          B.38 utt2:  I don't know if you're familiar with that operation,  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C but, } what you do is you just build up the pressure -- /  

b          A.39 utt1:   Uh-huh. /

qy^g          A.41 utt1:   {D Well, } it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it? /

sv          A.69 utt1:   <Laughter>  {D Well, } {F uh, } if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail.  /
