sd          B.2 utt2: [ I, + I'm ] from Alabama. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  South Alabama,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C and so } I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement.   

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } in a pretty liberal family [ for, + for ] that area at the time. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {C And so } I was very much a part of [ all the, + {F uh } <breathing>, {D you know, } what ] was going on there. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-uh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } my parents are pretty active  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } it was very scary  /
sd          B.10 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C but } ] now we've seen, {D you know, } <breathing> {F uh, } black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, {D you know, } twenty years ago. /  

ba          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } definitely. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  There's still a lot [ to be + <breathing>, {D you know, } to be ] accomplished,  /

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C because } I can remember, {D you know, } separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and --

sd          A.21 utt3: I guess when I think of social changes, I [ think, + think ] more of, {F uh } <lipsmack>, {F uh, } visiting habits of families --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.27 utt2: that there's less visiting done, I think, on a whole than there used to be. - /
sv          A.27 utt3: Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or  not,  /
sv          A.27 utt4: you went visiting <laughter>.  /
sv          A.27 utt5: {C And, } {F uh, } today, {D you know, } people, they do visit,  /
sv          A.27 utt6: {C but } it's not quite the same as, {F uh, } what it was, say, twenty years ago, thirty years ago. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  {C And } I grew up [ in, + out in ] the country, too, basically, in a rural area --   

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  -- and with lots of family. /

b^r          A.31 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C And so } we were always at family in different [ p-, + --

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  {C But } even now, {D you know, } they don't even do that. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  {D Well, } they're so spread out,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: I think has a lot to do with it. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } {C and } they're so busy. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /

aa^r          A.43 utt2: right. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  -- in our family, {D you know, } twenty years ago, not that many of the women worked. /  

aa          A.45 utt1:  That's right,  /
aa          A.45 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {C And } now, {F uh, } almost all the women work. /  

aa          A.47 utt1:  The majority,  /
aa          A.47 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {C And, so } that means, {D you know, } [ a lot of + <lipsmack>, a lot of ] the social visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women --   

aa          A.49 utt1:  Probably,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {C because } when you work --

b          A.105 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
