b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          A.9 utt3: my husband was complaining the other day  /
sd(^q)          A.9 utt4: {C because } he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling  /

sd          A.15 utt3:  They won't take those.  /
sd          A.15 utt4: We like to [ put our, + just put our ] newspapers in a paper bag, {D you know, } and then carry them up there that way. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: it takes us about a year to save up enough to be [ worth, + {D you know, } worth ] bothering to go in and do,  /

sv          B.28 utt1:  {C And } <throat_clearing> I know a lot of people it [ would, + would ] solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup  /

sv(^q)          B.36 utt1:  {D You know, } because [ then it would, + then it would ] make monetary sense to them, {D you know, } to say, hey, {D you know, } if I just spend the time [ to, + to ] sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off. /

sd          A.37 utt3: my father was telling me about some program he read about where [ you buy your bags, + {D like } you buy your garbage bag ] from the city, /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C and } you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag  /
sd          A.39 utt2: {C but } then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything,  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {C so } how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for. /
