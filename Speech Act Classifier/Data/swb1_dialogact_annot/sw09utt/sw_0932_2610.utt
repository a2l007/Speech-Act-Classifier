qo          A.1 utt1:  {D So, } how do you feel about the metric system? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  <T V> {F Oh, } I like it.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:  [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] have a foreign, + {D actually } I have more than one foreign ] automobile.  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C And } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] find the, + {F uh, } I find [ the, + the ] ] nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters, - /
sd          B.2 utt4: I was trying to build a shed  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C and } they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches  /
sd          B.2 utt6: {C and } we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, {F uh } ... /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.3 utt2: {C and } it's, - /
sd          A.3 utt3: I forget how many millimeters.  /
qy          A.3 utt4: {C So } you used the metric? /  

nn          B.4 utt1:  {D Well, } no.  /
sd^e          B.4 utt2:  What we did was wind up using, - /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } [ you just go, + you just go ] down  /
sd          B.4 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] you get out [ [ the, + the, ] + so many ] inches  /
sd          B.4 utt5: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we just marked a little bit less than that, {F uh, } which is somewhat awkward  /
sd          B.4 utt6: {C but } had it been millimeters, you could have done. - /
%          B.4 utt7: I think what's interesting, - /
sd          B.4 utt8: the way engineering people do is they, - /
sd          B.4 utt9: they, in essence, have gotten around it [ by, + by ] listing, {F uh, } decimal inches. /

b^r          A.5 utt2: yeah. /

sd^e          A.7 utt3:  {F Uh, } I work in metal fab  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C and } tenths of inches [ are, + are ] normal.  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C And, } {D you know, } [ [ me-, + {D you know, } it is broken up in, ] + {D you know, } the inch is broken up ] and has been for quite some time [ for, + in ] tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch. /

sd          A.9 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years  /

sv          B.10 utt2: {C and } you're looking for a wrench  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {C and } you want the next size larger.  /
sd          B.10 utt4:  [ I've got, + I inherited ] [ some, + some ] stuff like fifteen thirty seconds. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {D Well, } {D now } that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch.  /
sv          B.12 utt2:  {C But } some of them, [ like, + like, ] twenty-seven - /
sd          B.12 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] there are some thirty seconds and some of the things [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } don't translate. /

^q          B.14 utt4: I need a smaller one.  /
sv(^q)          B.14 utt5: {E I mean } obviously you can look at it and say {D well, } {D anyway. } - /
sv          B.14 utt6: I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't, - /

qy          B.14 utt8: [ do you, + do you ] drink adult beverages? /
