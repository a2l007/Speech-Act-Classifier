sv          @A.3 utt2: this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city. /

sd          A.31 utt3: {C and } you really didn't have anywhere to go,  /
sd          A.31 utt4: {C and } it's sleeping time.  /
sd          A.31 utt5:  {C But } if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either <laughter>. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  <Laughter> {D Well, } we have several children that are in sports,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: {C and so } --   

b          A.33 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

sd          A.41 utt1:  {C But } I did a walk last night,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C and } it seemed like it was a little bit hot still.  /
sv          A.41 utt3: Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,  /
sd          B.42 utt2: that part I don't care about. /  

aa          A.43 utt1:  {D Well, } I agree, absolutely,  /
sv          A.43 utt2: {C and } {D you know, } it's all relative,  /
sd          A.43 utt3: {C because } I was from West Texas,  /
sd          A.43 utt4: {C and } it was very dry,  /
sd          A.43 utt5: {C and so } I thought Dallas was awful,  /

sd          A.45 utt1:  {C but } then this summer we went to Orlando for a week,  /
sd          A.45 utt2: {C and } it was so humid there that [ your, + {F um, } all your ] windows [ were fr-, + were wet ] every morning.  /

x          B.48 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.49 utt1:  because it's kind of like what you're used to.  /

sd          B.54 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } [ even, + ] I don't know if that's because plants are just that way  /
