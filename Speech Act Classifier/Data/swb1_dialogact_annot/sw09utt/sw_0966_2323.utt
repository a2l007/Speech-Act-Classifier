o          B.1 utt1:  All righty.  /
qy          B.1 utt2:  {D So, } {F uh, } do you think Russia's still a threat? /  

^h          A.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess I'm maybe naive,  /
ng          A.2 utt2: {C but } I never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us. /  

ba          B.3 utt1:  There you go <TV>. /  

sv          A.4 utt1:  {E I mean, } obviously [ there's <talking> [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] possibility of, {E or, } was ] the possibility of war, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.4 utt2: {C but, } I somehow think that war is one of those  things that maybe is inevitable,  /
sd          A.4 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } I don't look at it as a threat in the same sense [ that, + that ] I think this question was meant.  /
qo          A.4 utt4: What about you? /  

%          B.5 utt1:  {D Well, } I think, - /
qy          B.5 utt2: [ h-, + have ] you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR? /  

ny          A.6 utt1:  Yes. /  

bk          B.7 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          B.7 utt2: you know, {D like, } how, {F uh, } [ these two, + there was {D like } three ] continents that were always fighting with each other --   

b          A.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.9 utt1:  -- right,  /
sv          B.9 utt2: {C and } you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S --   

b          A.10 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.11 utt1:  -- [ d-, + during ] the whole time  /
sd          B.11 utt2: {C and } what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same [ as, + as ] themselves, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.11 utt3: the prisoners of wars [ were, + were ] the same as the people living in that country. /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.13 utt1:  {C And } you didn't want that to happen.  /
sd          B.13 utt2:  {C And } to me, it had always been that way.  /
sd          B.13 utt3:  I mean what happens is, you have a government, right,  /
sd          B.13 utt4: {C and } this government controls everything, right -- /  

b          A.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.15 utt1:  -- {C and then } you have the people inhabiting the country  /
sd          B.15 utt2: {C and } these people have nothing to do with the government itself. /  

b          A.16 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  {C And } these people are the same as you are. /  

b          A.18 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.19 utt1:  {C And } what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, {A supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, } it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself.  /
sd          B.19 utt2:  Like I was telling people, I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on.  /
sv          B.19 utt3:  [ In Lith-, + in Lithuania, ] [ they, + they ] were announced to be a separate country.  /
sv          B.19 utt4:  {C But, } yet, [ the, + the ] government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people  /
sv          B.19 utt5: {C and } the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people. /  

b          A.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sv(^q)          B.21 utt1:  {D You know. }  It's like you're not going to go in there and say no,  /
^q          B.21 utt2: listen,  /
^q          B.21 utt3: there's a separate country.  /
qh          B.21 utt4:  Why,  /
sv          B.21 utt5: because you're going into the border. /  

aa          A.22 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.22 utt2: uh-huh. /  

b          B.23 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.23 utt2:  Once you get into the border, then there's a threat.  /
sv          B.23 utt3:  {C But } what happens is you don't mess with us, we won't mess with you,  /
sv          B.23 utt4: {C but } let's mess with the neutral countries. /  

aa          A.24 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.24 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          B.25 utt1:  {D You know, } {C and } now [ it's {D like } + {D you know, } they're saying ] [ other people [ were, + were ] + I guess, other leaders were ] still crazier about it, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.25 utt2: {D like } other people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there,  /
sv          B.25 utt3: {C but } Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere. /  

aa          A.26 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.26 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.27 utt1:  {C And } the U S has.  /
sv          B.27 utt2: {D You know, } [ it's like they, + it seems like [ [ they can, + their, ] + their ] army or whatever can, ] can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and [ do, + do ] the job with, {F uh, } {D you know, } less suffering. /  

aa          A.28 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.28 utt2: uh-huh. /  

%          B.29 utt1:  {D You know, } {C but } [ I think, + I think ] [ the thing is, is that there, + the thing ] - /
sd          B.29 utt2: like  they were saying they go, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.29 utt3: {D like } Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button.  But not the U S S R, /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.31 utt1:  The U S S R --   

b          A.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.33 utt1:  -- wouldn't do it.   

b          A.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.35 utt1:  Because they got too much at stake. /  

sv          A.36 utt1:  {C But } I guess there was concern, {F uh, } that [ I-, + Iraq ] would use, {D you know, } nonconventional warheads [ with, + with ] the chemical weapons and things  /
sd          A.36 utt2: {C but } yet it didn't happen. /  

b          B.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qh          A.38 utt1:  {E I mean } --   

sv          B.39 utt1:  {D Well, }   

+          A.40 utt1:  -- why not. /  

+          B.41 utt1:  [ My, + my ] point of view to that is, is that [ it would have had so much, + {E I mean } the attack would have been so complete ] on Iraq if they had.  /
sv          B.41 utt2:  {E I mean } [ the first, + you can imagine the first, ] {F uh, } chemical weapon used -- /  

b          A.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.43 utt1:  -- that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, {D you know, } three hours of when the weapon was shot. /  

bf          A.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } {C so } you think it was fear that kept Iraq from --   

aa          B.45 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.46 utt1:  -- using it.  /
%          A.46 utt2: {C But, } yet the, -/  

%          B.47 utt1:  {C And } [ what happens is, + what happens is, ] - /
qh          B.47 utt2: suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will,  /
sv          B.47 utt3: he's got one less thing to go against him. /  

aa          A.48 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.48 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          B.49 utt1:  {E I mean, } if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide --   

b          A.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.51 utt1:  -- because he's going to be captured and, {D you know. } - /
sv(^q)          B.51 utt2: {C But } the U. S. also makes a lot of, {F uh, } {D you know, } treaties with other people {D like } saying, okay,  /
^q          B.51 utt3: if you give up, then you can come live in our country  /
^q          B.51 utt4: {C and } we'll take care of you, like Marcos, right. /  

b          A.52 utt1:  Right. /  

^q          B.53 utt1:  We'll overthrow you,  /
^q          B.53 utt2: {C but } yet you can still come live here, {D you know. } /  

aa          A.54 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.54 utt2: I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet. /  

aa          B.55 utt1:  {F Uh } <laughter>, no. /  

x          A.56 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

aa^r          B.57 utt1:  No. /  

sv          A.58 utt1:  I think [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] not very likely.  /
sv          A.58 utt2:  {C But } yet {D you know, } [ as, + as ] the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare --   

b          B.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.60 utt1:  -- on his own people.  /
aa          A.60 utt2:  {C And } I guess that makes sense what you said that, {F uh, } within their own borders they feel freer to do --   

b          B.61 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.62 utt1:  -- [ what, + what ] they feel necessary. /  

b          B.63 utt1:  Right. /  

b          A.64 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.65 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ there's, + there's ] just, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.65 utt2: {D like } [ [ people will go, + {D like } they, ] + {D like } the U. S. goes ] and goes into Panama  /
%          B.65 utt3: {C and } what, - /
sv          B.65 utt4: {D see } I don't believe in war.  /
sd          B.65 utt5:  That's my thing.  /
sv          B.65 utt6:  I don't believe that anybody should die --   

b          A.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.67 utt1:  -- {D you know, }  /
%          B.67 utt2: {C and so } then, {D you know, } you have, - /
sv          B.67 utt3: {C because } what happens is, - /
sv          B.67 utt4:  suppose [ I'm, + I ] go to war  /
sv          B.67 utt5: {C and } I'm holding a gun  /
sv          B.67 utt6: {C and } I'm just looking at myself holding a gun  /
sv          B.67 utt7: {C and } whoever shoots first survives, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.67 utt8:  {C But } that same person also has a family  /
sv          B.67 utt9: {C and, } {D you know } --   

b          A.68 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.69 utt1:  -- his parents are going to cry  /
sv          B.69 utt2: {C and, } {D you know, } life ends there  /
sv          B.69 utt3: {C and } to me that's ridiculous.  /
sd          B.69 utt4:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } I just don't believe it.  /
sv          B.69 utt5:  I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't,  /
sv          B.69 utt6: {C but } it's pretty hard to think that, {D you know, } people are just going to shoot each other down  /
sv          B.69 utt7: {C and } it's legal in a situation like that. /  

sv          A.70 utt1:  {D Well } --   

b          B.71 utt1:  {D You know. } /  

+          A.72 utt1:  -- or [ that, + that ] it resolves anything in the end.  [ That -- +   

b          B.73 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.74 utt1:  -- that ] negotiations couldn't resolve. /  

aa          B.75 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.75 utt2: [ {E I mean, } + {E I mean } ] Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous  /
sv          B.75 utt3: {C and } [ he, + all he ] was trying to do was make money at the beginning --   

b          A.76 utt1:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /  

+          B.77 utt1:  -- [ so + and ] keep his power,  /
%          B.77 utt2: {C but, } {D well, } -/  

qy^d          A.78 utt1:  {D Well, } it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S. /  

nn          B.79 utt1:  No,  /
sv^e          B.79 utt2: [ I, + I ] don't think so.  /
sv          B.79 utt3: I think, {F uh, } [ they're getting, + they're especially getting ] their life back together now  /
%          B.79 utt4: {C because } a lot of things that you saw on TV, - /
sv          B.79 utt5: a lot of, {F uh, } inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to. /  

b          A.80 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.81 utt1:  A lot of {D like } dancers and stuff like that. /  

b          A.82 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.83 utt1:  They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete.  /
sv          B.83 utt2: {C So } it must be a beautiful country. /  

b          A.84 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.85 utt1:  It's just that, {D you know, } they won't let you get out  /
sv          B.85 utt2: {C and } when you want to get out of the country, that's what you want to do. /  

aa          A.86 utt1:  Right,  /
aa^r          A.86 utt2: right. /
