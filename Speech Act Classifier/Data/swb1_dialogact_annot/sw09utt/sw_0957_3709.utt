sd          A.48 utt2: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } <music> {C and then, } ] {F uh, } I hurt my neck, {F uh, } about three years ago. /  

b          B.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.50 utt1:  {C So, } you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, {F uh, } hurting yourself when you play high. /  

b          B.51 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see. /  

sd          A.52 utt1:  [ You have to, + you have to ] do it correctly, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.52 utt2: it is like an exercise in itself,  /
sd          A.52 utt3: {C but } <noise> a lot of people, {F uh, } strain themselves doing it. /  

b          B.53 utt1:  {F Oh, } I see.  /
qy          B.53 utt2:  {F Uh, } {D so } you are [ [ in, + {F uh, } in ] + part of ] a band? /

sd          B.55 utt3: I use to play an instrument when I was in high school,  /
sd          B.55 utt4: {C but } it wasn't the trumpet <laughter>. /  

b          A.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.57 utt1:  {C So, } I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.  /
%          B.57 utt2:  I think, -/  

b          A.58 utt1:  Uh-huh <music>. /

sd^e          A.60 utt2: {F uh, } {D well } the weather is nice except for when it rains, {D you know } --   

b          B.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.62 utt1:  -- {E I mean } in Dallas. /  

b          B.63 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b^m          A.64 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.64 utt2:  I keep thinking about it,  /
sd          A.64 utt3: {C but } that doesn't mean it gets done.  /
sd          A.64 utt4:  [ I, + I ] mostly jump rope more. /  

b          B.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          A.66 utt1:  {D You know. } /  

b          B.67 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.67 utt2: I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, {F uh, } when I was, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.67 utt3: {D well } a while back I was more into basketball -- /  

b          A.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.69 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves. /  

b          A.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.71 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ] it has been a while since I have done that. /  

b          A.72 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.72 utt2:  I do a toe lift and squats --   

b          B.73 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.74 utt1:  -- for that.  /
sv          A.74 utt2:  {C But } you know [ it, + it ] [ doesn't, {F uh, } doesn't, ] {F uh, } accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have {D like } when you are running for a long time. /  

b          B.75 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.76 utt1:  They tend to tighten up [ whenever, + whenever ] you have to do something --   

b          B.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.78 utt1:  -- at, {F uh, } {F uh, } great length of time. /  

aa          B.79 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.79 utt2: [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } that ] is true.  /
sd          B.79 utt3:  I have noticed that, {F uh, } /  

sv          A.80 utt1:  {C And } it also builds too much mass if you just, {D you know. } -/  

b          B.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.82 utt1:  {C So, } [ [ it is like, + I, ] + I ] lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with. /  

b          B.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.84 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } then it doesn't bother me very much. /  

b          B.85 utt1:  Yeah.  /
b^r          B.85 utt2:  Yeah.  /
ba          B.85 utt3:  {F Huh. }  That is interesting though.  /
sd          B.85 utt4: {F Uh, } I have been thinking of changing, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.85 utt5: I have done the same routine for almost two years now  /
sd          B.85 utt6: {C and } I am thinking of, {F uh, } changing it up. /  

b          A.86 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.87 utt1:  {F Uh, } that is why, {D well, } {D you know, } I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, {F uh, } get out of the routine. /  

b          A.88 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.89 utt1:  {C Because } I have heard that, {D you know, } you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing. /  

b          A.90 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.91 utt1: {C So, } I am looking at changing things a little bit. /  

b          A.92 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.92 utt2: [ that is, + {F uh, } I have ] started doing more push ups  /
sd          A.92 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it has helped a lot  /
sd(^q)          A.92 utt4: {C and then } I add sets to it --   

b          B.93 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.94 utt1:  -- so that I don't like you said, wear it out.  /
sd          A.94 utt2:  I don't try to push it so   the end --   

b          B.95 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.96 utt1:  -- in one set. /
