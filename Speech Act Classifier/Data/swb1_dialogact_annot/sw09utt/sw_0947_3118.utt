o          @A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy^t          @A.1 utt2: do you want to start? /  

aa          B.2 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {F uh, } [ I haven't, + I don't ] know [ that much about the possi-, + what the possible choices ] could be about reorganizing the trial by jury,  /
sv          B.2 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } I think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be [ new-, + unanimous. ] /  

qy          A.5 utt1:  {D Now } [ that, + ] [ do you, + do you ] agree, that they should all be unanimous? /

qrr          A.7 utt1:  {C Or } [ even, + even ] in, {F uh, } like they said, {D you know, } lesser, {D you know, } trials, {D you know, } lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still? /  

no          B.8 utt1:  I don't know,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: [ I don't know if I feel, + I don't feel ] real strongly about that.  /
%          B.8 utt3:  If the, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.8 utt4: the thing is, though, [ I, + I ] didn't think even if it was a lower conviction, [ I didn't think that you could, + {F uh, } I didn't think that you really had ] to have [ a, + a ] jury <laughter>. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  [ Unless, + I guess, if ] you request one you can.  /
%          B.10 utt2:  {C But } I think, - /
%          B.10 utt3: yeah,  /
sv          B.10 utt4: making it unanimous sometimes [ might, {F uh, } let, + {A the only thing, } it might let ] more people get off.  /
sv          B.10 utt5:  I don't think it would convict any more people. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {C And } we have so many people already, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.12 utt2: the jails are already overloaded. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {D Well, } the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {E I mean } if one is determined [ that it's, + {D you know, } that he feels that he's, ] {D you know, } going against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.  /
sv          A.13 utt3:  {C So } I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets <noise> tired of fighting, {D you know, } just gives in. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.14 utt2:  {D Well, } if it's, - /
ar          B.14 utt3: no,  /
qw          B.14 utt4: {C but } [ [ they, + they, ] + what if they ] never agree.  /
qy          B.14 utt5: [ Doesn't it just, + {F uh, } do they ] have to go back and do a whole new trial  /
%          B.14 utt6: {C or, } -/  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And } they have to stay in until they all agree -- /  

b^m          B.16 utt1:  Agree <<faint>>. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  -- yeah.  /
h          A.17 utt2:  I don't know,  /
sd          A.17 utt3: I'm not sure if they go, {E I mean } to twelve new people or what they do exactly,  /
sd          A.17 utt4: {C but } I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before [ he can either, + {D you know, } either he or she can either go free or  to jail, either one. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C and } that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent <laughter>. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  Especially because there's twelve.  /
%          B.20 utt2:  The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too, - /
sv          B.20 utt3: a lot of times, {F uh, } the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury  /
sv          B.20 utt4: {C and } they can sway them that way, too. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  [ That's, + that's ] just it.  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  I don't understand.  /
sv          A.21 utt3:  You're supposed to, {D you know, } go in [ if you have, + {D you know, } {D like } if you've ] never heard of the people before or anything,  /
qh          A.21 utt4: {C but } I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and  everything else how you can get people that are [ total, + totally ] impartial to it. /  

aa          B.22 utt1:  I know.  /
sv          B.22 utt2: [ I don't think, + {D well, } I guess ] you really can't,  /
qh          B.22 utt3: {C but } the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd^t          B.24 utt1:  [ {C So, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] then, {D again, } {D you know, } [ [ they, + the, ] + one of the questions they ] asked is, should it just be decided by a judge  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {C and } that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, [ they, + they ] can't be fired, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.24 utt3: [ they have to, + they stay ] till they retire -- /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  -- {C and } sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too <laughter>. /

aa          A.27 utt2: I agree.  /
sv          A.27 utt3:  I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone.  /

fe          A.27 utt5: {C but, } hey,  /
qh          A.27 utt6: how many times have you heard of judges being bought over. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  I know. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {D You know, } {C so } [ [ [ [ it, + it's, ] + I, ] + I think, ] + I think ] [ in, + in ] the end, the judge has the presiding, {D you know, } {F uh, } vote.  /
sv          A.29 utt2:  [ [ I think he can be, + {D you know, } I, ] + I don't know if it's ] the way it is in real life,  /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C but } I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C and } the judge [ to-, + totally ] finds it obnoxious  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C and } he completely, {D you know, } goes the other way. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {D Now, } I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or  what. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  I think in some cases they are. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C But } they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is --   

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  -- if it's, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.36 utt2: {C so } that's another thing where they have the power,  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C but } maybe juries could be less than twelve people  /
qh          B.36 utt4: {C or } would that be more fair or less fair.  /
sv          B.36 utt5:  Maybe there should be more than twelve people <laughter>.  /

sd          B.40 utt2: {C and } I've never been on jury duty,  /
