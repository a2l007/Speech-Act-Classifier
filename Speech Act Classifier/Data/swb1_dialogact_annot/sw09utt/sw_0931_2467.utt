ad          @A.1 utt1:  {D So, } {F uh, } describe your family budget. /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I've, + {F uh, } for a lot of years [ I, + I've ] ] pretty much flied without one,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } just recently, {F uh, } [ we, + we ] set up a budget,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we're trying to stick to it.  /
sd          B.2 utt4:  We just bought a new house.  /
sd          B.2 utt5:  {C So } [ we've got everything, + {D you know, } pretty much we know ] what [ our, + {F uh, } our ] fixed expenses are per month,  /
sd          B.2 utt6: {C and then } we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range,  /
sd          B.2 utt7: [ {C and then, } + {F uh, } then ] there's the ones that you never know anything about,  /
sd          B.2 utt8: {C and } [ that's, + that's ] the food  /
sd@          B.2 utt9: [ budget. + ]   

aa          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } yeah,  /
sv          A.3 utt2: {C and } to some extent, utilities, I imagine. /  

+@          B.4 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ar          B.4 utt2: {D well, } the utilities are pretty much, - /
sv          B.4 utt3: you can pretty much figure what they're going to be,  /
sd          B.4 utt4: {C and } one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  They have that to some extent here,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {C but } it's not quite as good. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  And, {F uh, } transportation expenses,  /
qy^d          A.7 utt2: I guess you own a car. /  

ny          B.8 utt1:  Yes  /
sd^e          B.8 utt2: sir. /  

qy          A.9 utt1:  {C And } you know how much you're going to drive every week? /  

no          B.10 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I used to, + {F um, } I used to ] know, {F uh, } fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because [ [ I, + I was very convenient, ] + I lived, ] {F uh, } nine tenths of a mile from work. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  [ {C So, } + {C so, } ] it was, {D you know, } two miles a day <laughter> to and from work.  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C So }  it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot.  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  {C But } now I've just bought a new house,  /
sd          B.12 utt4: {C and } I'm a half hour,  /
sd          B.12 utt5: {C and so } my transportation costs have gone up by, {F uh, } five times <laughter>. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.13 utt2: I understand that.  /
sd          A.13 utt3: [ We, + we ] have a real similar situation.  /
sd          A.13 utt4:  Ours, {F uh, } have quintupled, at least.  /
sd          A.13 utt5:  {C So } there is a real family budget. /  

aa          B.14 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.14 utt2: pretty much, {F um. }  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  The problem is there never seems to be enough money.  /
sd          B.14 utt4: I have three children,  /
sv          B.14 utt5: {C and } it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need,  /
sv          B.14 utt6: {C and, } {F uh, } of course, nothing ever goes down,  /
%          B.14 utt7: {E I mean, } {F uh, } I remember, - /
sd          B.14 utt8: I have five children total.  /
sd          B.14 utt9: I have three left in the house. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C And } I can remember years ago, when school would start,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } I'd go buy all five kids, {D you know, } shoes,  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C and } I could get [ out of the, + out of the ] shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars.  /
sv          B.16 utt4:  Nowadays, thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes -- /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  If you're lucky. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  -- yeah,  /
sv          B.18 utt2: {C so } I mean things have just really gone out of sight in [ the last, + {F uh, } I guess about the last ] ten years. /  

qr          A.19 utt1:  Exempt or nonexempt. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  I'm exempt. /  

ba          A.21 utt1:  Wow,  /
ba          A.21 utt2: must be nice. /  

x          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.23 utt1:  Part of the high price spread.  {F Uh, }  /
ar          A.23 utt2: no,  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {D well, } [ we don't, + we do, ]  /
sd          A.23 utt4: {C but } we don't have a family budget.  /
sd          A.23 utt5: We have the fixed things we have to pay. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And } we have the things that are extras.  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  {C But } it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  And, {D well, } {D you know, } the auto budget,  /
sd          A.27 utt2: car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  And insurance,  /
qy          A.29 utt2: is insurance bad there? /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {F Um, } I've got, {F uh, } two older cars.  /
%          B.30 utt2:  There both, - /
sd          B.30 utt3: one's a seventy-seven  /
sd          B.30 utt4: {C and }  one's a seventy-eight. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {D Well, } we've got one eighty-nine. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C And } my insurance [ is about, + it was running about ] four hundred dollars a year.  /
sd          B.32 utt2: {C But } when I moved to the new town I live in, - /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C because } it's a different county, which has less crime, and, {F uh, } [ less, + {D you know, } less ] highways  /
sd          B.32 utt4: {C and so }  it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned,  /
sd          B.32 utt5: {C so }  [ [ my, + my, ] + I think my ] insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year. /  

ba          A.33 utt1:  Wow.  /
ba          A.33 utt2:  That's not bad,  /
bf          A.33 utt3: four hundred and something a year.  /
%          A.33 utt4:  [ That's, + that's, ] -/  

ar          B.34 utt1:  It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  That's cheaper than we pay. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: I was down in Texas for two years,  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C and } I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance.  {F Um, } /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {D Well, } here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qy          A.39 utt1:  Do you have that there? /  

x          B.40 utt1:   ((   ))  /
sd          B.40 utt2: they have no fault in Maryland also. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  {D Well, } no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that <<pause>> everyone pays all the time --   

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.43 utt1:   -- instead of just the guilty party pays. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          B.44 utt2:  Yeah. /  

x          A.45 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.46 utt1:  [ It's kind of, + it's kind of ] strange here the way things go.  {F Uh, }  /
sd          B.46 utt2: here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up. /  

bh          A.47 utt1:  You're kidding. /  

nn          B.48 utt1:  Nope.  /
sd^e          B.48 utt2: They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company. /  

ba          A.49 utt1:  God. /  

%          B.50 utt1:  {D Well, } if you, - /
qw^d          B.50 utt2: I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,  /
%          B.50 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

sd          A.51 utt1:  Not at all. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated.  /
sd          B.52 utt2:  There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic. /  

qy^d          A.53 utt1:  They don't even try to keep up with it. /  

nn          B.54 utt1:  No. /  

ba          A.55 utt1:  God. /  

sd^e          B.56 utt1:  Not a bit. /  

qy          A.57 utt1:  {D So } you lived in Texas for a while. /  

ny          B.58 utt1:  Yes  /
sd^e          B.58 utt2: sir. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  I spent, {F uh, } couple of years down there.  /
sd          B.60 utt2:  Moved down there in eighty-seven  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C and } moved out in eighty-nine. /  

qw          A.61 utt1:  [ Are, + where ] you from originally. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {F Uh, } right here in Maryland. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  {F Huh, }  /
bf          A.63 utt2: {C so } you just basically went home when you had a chance. /  

aa          B.64 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.64 utt2: my family, {F uh, } didn't like Texas,  /
sd          B.64 utt3: {C and } I had a chance to, {F uh, } transfer up.  /
sd          B.64 utt4: T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in  ((   )) . /  

ba          A.65 utt1:  That's nice. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {C So } I got an opportunity to transfer back,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C and } I took it. /  

ba          A.67 utt1:  God,  /
ba          A.67 utt2: that's great.  /
sd          A.67 utt3: {F Uh, } I'm a native Texan. /

sd          A.69 utt1:  West Texan. /

ny          A.73 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.74 utt1:  -- {C but } [ Plano, + maybe five percent of the Plano ] actually were from Texas.  /

sv          A.81 utt1:  A different world from down there. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.83 utt1:  {D So, } {F uh, } Colorado's been fun.  /
sd          A.83 utt2:  {C But } they have a real problem.  /
sd          A.83 utt3:  Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.  /
sd          A.83 utt4:  {C And } every time you [ look at a, + look at the ] mountains --   

b          B.84 utt1:  Yeah. /

x          B.86 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.87 utt1:  {C Or } so it seems.  /
sd          A.87 utt2:  I may just be paranoid,  /
sd          A.87 utt3: {C but } that state income tax is just eating me alive. /

sv          B.88 utt5: {C but } they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and,
