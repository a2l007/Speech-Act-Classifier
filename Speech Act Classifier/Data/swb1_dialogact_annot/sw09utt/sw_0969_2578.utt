sv          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by, {F uh, } Kitty Kelly, the unauthorized biography.  /
qy          A.1 utt2: Are you interested in that at all? /  

ng           B.2 utt1:  Not really <laughter>.  /
sd          B.2 utt2: I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C so } [ I, + I ] don't particularly read, {F um, } biographies or autobiographies. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  # Uh-huh <talking>. # /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  # I haven't # read too many.  /

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          A.5 utt2:  {D Well, } [ I, + the reason why I ] was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to, - /
sd          A.5 utt3: I'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan <laughter>,  /
sv          A.5 utt4: {C and so }  it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it.  /
sd          A.5 utt5:  {C And } I thought just purely for entertainment, I might enjoy that.  /
sd          A.5 utt6:  {C But } [ I, + I ] wouldn't want to go out and buy it {D like, } {D you know, } the hard back copy of it. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C But } I might check, /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  [ If they, + if they ] had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Really. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  [ [ I, + I just, ] + {D you know, } I'm just ] not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {D You know, } unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  For me it would be interesting to find out what life was, {F uh, } [ l-, + like, ] {D you know, } in that period.  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  But,    

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          A.17 utt2: I prefer to read, - /
sd          A.17 utt3: if I read a biography, it's mostly because maybe I have to, {F uh, } {D you know, } - /
sd          A.17 utt4: back when I was in school I had to have information about that person or, {F um, } preparing some kind of lesson  /
sd          A.17 utt5: {C and } I need to have more information about people.  /
sd          A.17 utt6:  {C But } [ I, + I ] do like to read some biographies,  /
sv          A.17 utt7: {C but } that one just sounded {D like } gossipy.  /
sd          A.17 utt8:  {C And } I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover, but flip through [ just for, + just to get ] a good laugh. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.18 utt2:  I think the last biography that I read, [ I'm not, + I think ] [ it was, + it was, ] {F um, } on Lady Randolph Churchill,   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  Churchill's mother.  /
sd          B.20 utt2:  {C And } that was excellent. /  

bh          A.21 utt1:  Was it? /  

ny          B.22 utt1:  {F Um, } yeah.  /
sd^e          B.22 utt2:  It was,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: it's in two parts.  /
sd          B.22 utt4:  I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that, {F uh, } because that was her name.  /
sd          B.22 utt5:  {C And, } {F um, }    

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  I only got to read one part of it.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  {C And } I've been looking for, {D you know, } the other half of it and read the, - /
sd          B.24 utt3: I read that half where she was in her later years,  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } it was absolutely excellent.  /
sd          B.24 utt5: {C And } it was very descriptive [ of, + of ] people with money back then and, {F uh, } affluents  in England, {F uh, } that, {D you know, }  were associated to the king and all.  /
sd          B.24 utt6: {C And } it was,   

b          A.25 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.26 utt1:  # really # pretty fascinating.  /
sd          B.26 utt2:  [ {C And } I + <laughter>, {C and } that ] was actually a couple of years ago,  /
sd          B.26 utt3: {C so, }   

b          A.27 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /

sd          B.30 utt6: as far as improving myself, {F uh, } I haven't read any lately.  /
sd          B.30 utt7: {C But } I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before.   

b          A.31 utt1:  # Uh-hum. # /  

+          B.32 utt1:  # {D You # know, } that you might have needed to read in school, but that I just didn't read for some reason or [ another, + another, ] or [ that, + {D you know, } that ] you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  # Right. # /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  # {C And } # you have so many out there [ that, + {F uh, } that ] [ you, + {D you know, } you ] never get a chance to read.  /
%          B.34 utt2:  {C And so, } I said, - /
sd          B.34 utt3: {D well, } I think it was because I read, {F um, } Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES, /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C and } [ I just, + {F um, } that, <barking> even when I ] read it now, it still makes me cry, the ending of it. /  

x          A.37 utt1:  # <Laughter>. #   

sd          B.38 utt1:  # {C And } # [ I couldn't believe, + [ I, + I ] could not believe ] that it took me so long to read such a good book. /

b          A.41 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.42 utt1:  # {D you # know, } that have withstood time and that are just excellent,  /
sv          B.42 utt2: something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or  whether it was the material [ they were written, + {D you know, } that was written ] about.  /
sd          B.42 utt3:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C so } ] I started reading.  /
sd          B.42 utt4: [ I had this {D like, } + {D you know, } I had a ] binge of bo-, - /

sd          B.42 utt6: I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband,  /

b          A.43 utt1:  Oh! /

sv          B.44 utt3: it seems like, {F uh, } older people have much better, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.44 utt4: in their schooling, [ they, + they ] got more of the classics than I did,
