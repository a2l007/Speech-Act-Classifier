b          B.39 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.39 utt2: [ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] got, {F uh, } chicken marinara the last two times. /

sv          A.50 utt2: [ {C but } + <laughter> {C and } ] the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail. /  

aa          B.51 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.51 utt2: that's true. /  

sd          A.52 utt1:  {F Uh, } the last time we had some, {F uh, } friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded [ wonder-, + wonderful ] in the recipe  /

aa          B.57 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.57 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> we took some  /
sd          B.57 utt3: {C and then } we had, {F uh, } German Shepherds at the time,  /
sd          B.57 utt4: {C and } we took some and gave it to the dogs,  /
sd          B.57 utt5: {C and } the dog [ never, + {D you know, } he treated ] it like a milk bone  /
sd          B.57 utt6: {C and } he never did finish it. /  

b          A.58 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.59 utt1:  He just barely made a dent in it. /  

b          A.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.61 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and, } {F uh, } then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time. /  

b          A.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.63 utt1:  It's, {F uh, } supposed to be candy. /  

b          A.64 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.65 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] did not turn out very well,  /

ba          A.68 utt2: that's interesting.  /
sd          A.68 utt3:  One of the things I do not make is dessert. /  

b          B.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.70 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation,  because, {F uh, } {D you know, } we have ice cream, <laughter> or something like that.  /
sd          A.70 utt2: {C And } that's why when I [ took, + did ] this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago,   

b          B.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.72 utt1:  it was just a total fiasco. /

sd          A.74 utt1:  {F Uh, } everything else was fine,  /

sv          B.91 utt4: it's mostly starch.  /
sv          B.91 utt5: {C So, } it fills you up  /
sv          B.91 utt6: {C and then } the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get. /
