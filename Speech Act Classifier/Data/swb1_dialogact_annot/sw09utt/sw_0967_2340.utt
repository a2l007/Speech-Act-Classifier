aa          A.74 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.74 utt2: I think that, {F uh, } hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,  /

sv          B.87 utt2: and get that youth back. /  

b          A.88 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.89 utt1:  {D You know, } sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, {F um, } just stationary -- /

sv          B.91 utt1:  -- {E I mean, } they'll get in a wheelchair  /
