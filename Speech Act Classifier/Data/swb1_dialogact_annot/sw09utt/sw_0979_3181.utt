o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  All right,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {D well, } I'm not a big exerciser,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C but } I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {C And so } basically at this point [ I'm, + I'm ] a real walker. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  I am, too. /  

bh          B.6 utt1:  Are you? /  

ny          A.7 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  I don't do [ that, + {F oh, } {A I guess I'll call it } that ] fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, {D you know, } and --   

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1:  -- keep their arms up.  /
sd          B.10 utt2:  I don't do that.  /
sd          B.10 utt3:  I mostly just take [ a, + a ] walk around the block or with my baby  /
sd          B.10 utt4: [ {C or, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] I have to do that at least once a day.  [ If it, +   

ba          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's good. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  If it's ] going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before.  /
sd          B.12 utt2: I can't neglect that because of the baby either. /  

qw          A.13 utt1:  {C And } how old is your baby? /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  [ She just, + {F uh, } {D well, } she ] was premature,  /

x          B.16 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } I walk two and a half to three miles every night. /  

ba          B.18 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- {C and } he lost sixty-two pounds -- /

ba          B.24 utt1:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  <Lipsmack>.  {C So } we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C and } we walk our dog every night --   

b          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  -- and go up around the elementary school.  /

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } except ] if it's raining or real cold --

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C And } he plays racquetball twice a week,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {C but } I'm not into that,  /
sv          A.35 utt3: {C so } --   

x          B.36 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.37 utt1:  -- I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that is just wonderful.  /
sd          B.38 utt2:  {D Now, } as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children  /
sv          B.38 utt3: {C and so, } {F uh, } I think at this point to fit it [ into, + to ] other things, it's kind of a task. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd(^q)          B.40 utt1:  {D You know. }  {F Uh, } it's not to where I'm just so freed up that [ I, + I ] just go, {F oh, } this is wonderful,  /
^q          B.40 utt2: let's go <laughter>. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  Right <laughter>,  /
aa          A.41 utt2: that's right.  /
sd          A.41 utt3:  I know my kids are into sports  /
sd          A.41 utt4: {C and } [ a lot of times, + tonight ] we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty  /
sd          A.41 utt5: {C so } we will just go out after that. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  {C So, } my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah.  /
qy          B.44 utt2:  {D Now, } does your husband usually go with you, then? /  

ny          A.45 utt1:  Yes. /  

ba          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D see, } {D now } that's really nice. /  

aa          A.47 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  Because mine's at meetings sometimes  /
sd          B.48 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] he's not really into it  /
%          B.48 utt3: {C so } --   

%          A.49 utt1:  No -- /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- I have to, -/  

sd          A.51 utt1:  -- my husband never was either until he lost the weight. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  That was his decision.  /

sd          A.53 utt2:  He had arthritis in his hips  /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C and } his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  I think that is so wonderful. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  {C So } once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C And } our dog has lost a little weight.  /
sd          A.55 utt3:  He walks every night, too <laughter>. /  

x          B.56 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.57 utt1:  {C So, } he gets excited when he sees us put on [ [ our, + our shoes, ] + our walking shoes. ] /  

ba          B.58 utt1:  I bet.   /
sv          B.58 utt2: I think that's really, really good.  /
sv          B.58 utt3: [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } I think [ this, + after you've done it a certain amount of time, it ] kind of does get to be a routine. /  

aa          A.59 utt1:  Yes. /  

%          B.60 utt1:  It's not, - /
sd          B.60 utt2: {D like } when I first started, it, {D you know, } that was the hardest thing was --   

^2          A.61 utt1:  Making time for it. /  

+          B.62 utt1:  -- to get ready and get out there.  /
sd          B.62 utt2:  {C But } now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a <laughter> ... -/  

b          A.63 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {D You know. }  {C And } I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me  /
sd          B.64 utt2: {C and } sometimes they don't.  /
sd          B.64 utt3:  {C And } when they don't, [ I, + I ] really notice, {D you know, } how fun it can be when they come.  /
sd          B.64 utt4: {C So, } {F uh, } I like to have somebody come with me. /  

aa          A.65 utt1:  I know,  /
sd          A.65 utt2: I do, too. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {F Uh, } I know [ most of, + enough of ] the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home --   

b          A.67 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  -- around this block area.  /
sd          B.68 utt2: {C So } [ it, + it's ] not real dangerous,  /
sd          B.68 utt3: {C but } still, I don't like to go alone. /  

aa          A.69 utt1:  No. /  

%          B.70 utt1:  {D So } <<faint>>. -/  

sd          A.71 utt1:  I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

aa          A.73 utt1:  {D You know, } it's nice to have another person there,  /
%          A.73 utt2: {C but } ... -/  

aa          B.74 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.74 utt2:  {D You know, } /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  Mostly, it's my husband  /
sd          A.75 utt2: {C and } sometimes it's my kids. /  

sv          B.76 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that's great.  /
sd          B.76 utt2:  [ I, + {C and, } {D well, } sometimes when [ I, + I ] ] take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise [ I, + I ] really think I do.  /
sd          B.76 utt3:  I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  {F Uh, } I found real quick that wasn't for me. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  Me, too.  /
sd          A.79 utt2: I did the dance step when I lived up in --   

b          B.80 utt1:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /  

+          A.81 utt1:  -- Michigan  /
sd          A.81 utt2: {C and } it just wore me out.  /
sd          A.81 utt3:  I would leave totally exhausted.  /
sd          A.81 utt4:  I never lost any weight,  /
sd          A.81 utt5: {C and } I got to the point I dreaded going in. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.82 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.83 utt1:  So walking seems to be a good solution for me  /
sd          A.83 utt2: {C and } it doesn't cost anything <laughter>. /  

aa          B.84 utt1:  Right <laughter>,  /
aa^r          B.84 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.84 utt3: {C And } it gives me time to think.  /
sd          B.84 utt4:  {C So } I think, not only does it help my body,  /
sd          B.84 utt5: {C but } I think it helps my mind --   

aa          A.85 utt1:  Yes. /

sd          B.86 utt2:  {C So } I like that. /
