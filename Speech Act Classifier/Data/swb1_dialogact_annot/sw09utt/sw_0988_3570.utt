o          A.1 utt1:  Okay, Howard,  /
qo          A.1 utt2: what do you think of our space budget  /
qy          A.1 utt3: {C and } should we go ahead [ and, + and ] keep exploring,  /
qrr          A.1 utt4: {C or } should we call a halt to it,  /
qy          A.1 utt5: is it doing any good? /  

sv          @B.2 utt1:  I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2: {D Now } I think [ what, + ] we made a major wrong turn when we went [ into the, + {F uh, } to the ] current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now --   

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,  /
sv          B.4 utt2: {C and } I think some of the earlier approaches were [ much more, + {F uh, } much better ] in many ways.  /
sv          B.4 utt3:  However, {F uh, } {D you know, } we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, {F uh, } some new space age materials, plastics and all that.  /
sv          B.4 utt4: {C So } I think it's been a good investment.  /
sd          B.4 utt5: {F Uh, } somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent --   

b          A.5 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- which is amazing for any governmental financed --   

b          A.7 utt1:  # {F Oh, } yes. # /  

+          B.8 utt1:  -- # program. # /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  Wish our post office could do that <laughter>. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  <Laughter> I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  <Laughter> That's right.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  I wish they'd just deliver stuff. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  I think, though, [ that + now that ] we're finally starting to get over the fears and [ the, + {F uh, } {F oh, } {A I don't know, } the ] guilt that we had out of, {F uh, } Challenger,  /
sv          B.12 utt2: I think maybe # we can # --   

b          A.13 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- pick up and go on now.  /
h          B.14 utt2:  {C But, } [ I, + I ] don't know.  /
sv          B.14 utt3:  I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives. /  

aa          A.15 utt1:  # I agree. # /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  # The space # station's where we should go --   

aa          A.17 utt1:  # I agree. # /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- # at this # point. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor  /
sd          A.19 utt2: [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {D you know, } {C and } ] I'm in favor of, {D you know, } getting closer to seeing certain things,  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C but } I'd like to see them also [ go, + {D you know, } go ] back up there, see, {D you know, } what they can do. See about setting a space station up.  /
sd          A.19 utt4: I'm all in favor of the space program,  /
sv          A.19 utt5: {C and } I don't think we should stop,  /
sv          A.19 utt6: {C and } I don't think we should cut the money. /  

qo          B.20 utt1:  {D Well, } where do you think we ought to go with it? /  

^h          A.21 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

qy          B.22 utt1:  You talking about, {F uh, } {F uh, } a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there? /  

ny          A.23 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.23 utt2: [ I would like, + I'd like ] to see that.  /
sd          A.23 utt3: I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, {D you know, } there's no life up there or anything, {D you know. }  /
h          A.23 utt4:  {C But } who knows.  /
sd          A.23 utt5:  {C And } I would like to see them do something like that. /

sv          A.25 utt1:  # [ I, + # I ] hate to see them just, {D you know, } keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things  /
sv          A.25 utt2: {C and, } [ I think they, + I think they ] lose sight [ of, + of ] probably what they're supposed to be doing. /  

qy^g          B.26 utt1:  {D Well, } I think about half the nations now [ are, + are ] military related, are  they not? /

sd^e          A.29 utt1:  I believe they are. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  It seems like [ it's + that ] high a percentage. /  

ad          A.31 utt1:  {D You know, } let's go back to our original thing with, {D you know, } our experiments and all [ the, + {D you know, } our ] actual exploring of space [ and, + and ] all that,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: and, {D you know, } [ with, + with ] Russia, {F uh, } seemingly not going to be as big a threat. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {D Well, } it can't afford to <laughter>. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Huh-uh, {D you know. }  /
