aa          B.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {C because } [ [ it's really, + it helps your, ] + if you have good credit, {D you know, } it helps you ] in the long run # when you want to go make a # --

aa          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {C and } I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases,  /
sd          B.26 utt3: {D like } whenever we go on trips, we always, {D you know, } use [ our, + our ] Visa or our Mastercard or whatever. /  

b          A.27 utt1:   ((   ))  <whispering>.  Yeah. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And then, } {F um, } {D you know, } we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later -- /

sv          A.33 utt3: {D well, } I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like  I say, because [ yo-, + there's ] so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing -- /  

b          B.34 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.35 utt1:  -- {C and } if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head. /

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- just pay them off, {D you know. } /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {C And } also, [ if you, + if someone ] did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, {D you know, } you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C and } [ I, + he ] said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, {D you know, } whatever payments you had,  /

b          A.41 utt1:  Right. /
