sd^e          B.32 utt2: I haven't. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {C And } I just thought it was so strange,  /

sd          A.41 utt2: {C and } I use {D like, } {F uh, } Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise --   

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  -- because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.  /
