o          A.1 utt1:  <Talking> Okay.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } just briefly.  /
sd          A.1 utt3:  {F Uh, } I worked in a nursing home  /
sd          A.1 utt4: {C so }  I kind of know, from way back, {F uh, } how things used to be run  /
sv          A.1 utt5: {C and } I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes  /
sd          A.1 utt6: {C but } I think, {F uh, } if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home, they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all.  /
sd          A.1 utt7:  It would be something that, <clicking> {D you know, } I would certainly, </talking> - /
sd          A.1 utt8: if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care --   

b          @B.2 utt1:  <Breathing> <TV> Uh-huh. /  

+          A.3 utt1:  -- where somebody comes in  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C and } they cook meals  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C and } they clean their house for them,  /
sd          A.3 utt4: that kind of thing,  /
sd          A.3 utt5: {C so } they still have their own independence  /
sd          A.3 utt6: and  not reliable, {D you know, } </clicking> - /
sd          A.3 utt7: they don't have to be in a nursing home situation.  /
%          A.3 utt8:  {C But, } {F uh, } I don't think - /
sd         A.3 utt9: the nursing homes, when I was working in them, were very much understaffed, very much, {F uh, } in need of good personnel. {F Uh, }  /
sd          A.3 utt10: I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that - /
sd          A.3 utt11: I wouldn't have, {D you know, } - /
sd(^q)          A.3 utt12: I look at it and say thank God,  /
^q          A.3 utt13: I got out of that kind of situation.  /
sd          A.3 utt14:  {C But } --   

b          B.4 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  -- [ they, + they ] were not given the time  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {C and } they were not given the money, basically, to staff, appropriately, people to help. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C And } I can remember lifting a patient all by myself, simply because there was not another person to help.  /
sd          A.7 utt2: It's {C either } [ le-, + leave ] the patient in bed all day long {C or } get them up  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C and } I would have preferred to get them up than <laughter> to leave them in bed all day.  /
sv          A.7 utt4:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C so } ] I think nursing homes [ are, + have ] changed.  /
h          A.7 utt5:  I'm not quite sure,  /
sv          A.7 utt6: {C but } hopefully, they have. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: [ [ wel-, + th-, ] + I ] guess I haven't had that much experience.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:  I've only seen {D like } my great grandparents in a nursing home -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  -- {C but } --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Yeah. /

b          A.13 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  -- {C and } then [ she, + she ] got sick  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and } she ended up in nursing home -- /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  -- {C and } my parents went to visit her  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } it got to the point where [ the nur-, + it seemed like the nursing ] home didn't want to deal wi-, her anymore -- /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  -- {C and so } they gave her drugs to keep her # asleep. # /  

aa          A.19 utt1:  # Yeah.  /
aa          A.19 utt2: # [ I, + I ] think [ that's, + that ] can happen  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C and } I think in the nursing home that I worked for, - /
sd          A.19 utt4: I wasn't quite sure of it,  /
sd          A.19 utt5: {C but } I'm sure that some of the patients were, {F uh, } given medication to keep them [ in, + {F uh, } quiet ]  /
%          A.19 utt6: [ {C and, } + # {C and, } ] # -/  

sv          B.20 utt1:  # Nice # sedative state. /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          A.21 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.21 utt3:  {C And } they would just lay all day long  /
%          A.21 utt4: and, {F uh, } the ones tha-, - /
sd          A.21 utt5:  they also put mentally ill patients in the same, - /
sd          A.21 utt6: they were not on the same, {D you know, } ward,  /
sd          A.21 utt7: {C but } [ they, + they ] were in the same nursing home  /
sd          A.21 utt8: {C so } [ that + these ] mentally ill patients could walk into where the other, {F uh, } older people that were in there for reasons of, {F uh, } {D you know } age, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.21 utt9: the mentally ill patients could walk right [ in, + into ] the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically.  /
sd          A.21 utt10: Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing, [ they could, + they had ] freedom to just walk around  /
sd          A.21 utt11: {C and } [ a lot of them were, + I think there was a couple that were ] schizophrenic  /
sd          A.21 utt12: {C and } I remember one time watching one of the, {F uh, } schizophrenic patients actually go out on, {A I don't know what they call it, } a binge or whatever you want to say it -- /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  -- she grabbed a hold of this, - /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C and } it was kind of funny when I looked back at it,  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C but, } {E I mean, } I remember the patient getting very upset.  /
sd          A.23 utt4:  That woman actually pulled, {F uh, } the other person's hair.  /
sd          A.23 utt5:  {E I mean } she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.23 utt6: {C and } it was a guy that was just really upset.  /
sd(^q)          A.23 utt7: {E I mean } he  (( said ))  what the hell are you think you're doing, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.23 utt8: {C and } I laughed at it then  /
sd(^q)          A.23 utt9: {C but } then I'm thinking God, {D you know, }  /
^q          A.23 utt10: if I had to put my parents in that nursing home, I wouldn't want them there.  /
sd          A.23 utt11: # {C So } # --   

b          B.24 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- I think there's laws now [ that kind of protect. + That nursing homes ] {C either } have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities, - /
sv          A.25 utt2: even though they're aging mentally ill, they are still mentally ill  /
sv          A.25 utt3: {C and } a lot of these older people [ have their, + {D you know, } they're ] not insane or anything like that.  /
sv          A.25 utt4:  They don't have these tendencies [ to, + # to ] lash out. # /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  # To be violent. # /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C But } seeing that kind of made me think twice about, - /
fe          A.27 utt2: jeez,  /
sd          A.27 utt3: I wouldn't put my mother, father in that nursing home at all. /  

qr          B.28 utt1:  Was this in a big town or a little town? /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  A small town. /

sd          A.35 utt2: [ I, + I ] kind of look at it this way.  /
sv          A.35 utt3:  I think if you have a big city area, I think there's more people to keep watch on it. /

sv          A.39 utt3:  {C And } you have more competition.  /
sv          A.39 utt4: {C And } I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community.  /
