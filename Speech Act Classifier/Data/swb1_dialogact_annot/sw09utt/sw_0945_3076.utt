aa          A.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.39 utt2: it's probably true. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {D Well, } [ of course, + of course ] listening to [ government, + the instructors, ] you'll find out that everything matters, /  

x          A.41 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C but } then you could go crazy worrying about everything. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } they also say that most people vote their local politics, [ that, + that ] local is [ far, + much ] more important than, {F uh, } national --   

sv          B.44 utt1:  {D Well } --   

+          A.45 utt1:  -- issues. /

sd          B.52 utt1:  {F Uh, } I know that I have been involved in preparing and [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  Even something so simple as getting a street light in between --

+          B.56 utt1:  -- lights on the end of the block. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {C But } it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over --

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take --

+          B.64 utt1:  -- that kind of action,  /
ba          B.64 utt2: {C and } that's completely unnecessary.  /
sd          B.64 utt3: In another particular case they were trying to <inhaling> put in a, {F um, } senior citizen's home --   

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.66 utt1:  -- [ in, + in ] an area very near our neighborhood,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C but } if you just cross that major street, the character of the neighborhood changes,  /
sd          B.66 utt3: {C and } it's less savory. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          B.68 utt2: {C And } [ [ that, + I was just very, ] + I felt very ] strongly about that,  /
sd          B.68 utt3: those people simply did not have access to safety, to security  /
sd          B.68 utt4: {C and } they were at risk. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  {C And } it was for elderly people who lived alone,  /
sd          B.70 utt2: {C and } they were going to put a cluster [ of, + of ] houses there for them.  /
sv          B.70 utt3: {C But } even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety. /  

aa          A.71 utt1:  No,  /

aa          A.71 utt3: that's true, /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  {C And } [ all it, + all it ] did was to, in my judgment, make them,
