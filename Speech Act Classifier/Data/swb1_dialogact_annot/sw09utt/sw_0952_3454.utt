x          B.28 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.29 utt1:  I think probably the big major change is the role of women. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  I think, one, the women, {F uh, } in the work force. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  And I think the fact that they're becoming, {F uh, } more, {F uh, } <breathing> {A how do I want to say, } not necessarily politically inclined,  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {C but } they're more apt to be in political offices --   

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  -- now.  /
sv          A.35 utt2: I think, {D you know, } we've made great strides --

+          A.37 utt1:  -- in that respect.  /
sv          A.37 utt2:  I think that [ it, + ] thirty years ago, when, {F uh, } I was newly married, family was very, very important. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit.  /
sv          A.39 utt2:  {C And } I think now it's revolving back full circle.  /
sv          A.39 utt3: I think --   

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- the family unit is becoming much more important than it was. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think [ it's, + that's ] probably for two reasons.  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {F Uh, } {D you know, } the number one is, women wanted to get out of the house.  /
sv          B.42 utt3:  {C And } the second reason [ was, + is ] everything costs so much more that if you don't have, {D you know, } equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much <laughter>. /  

aa          A.43 utt1:  That's true,  /

x          B.44 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.45 utt1:  {D Well, } I know that economically, {F uh, } a wife almost has to work anymore. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {C And } yet, I'm also noticing, {F uh, } in the areas that I'm working and stuff, more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago --   

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- they didn't.  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {E I mean, } {D you know, } they wanted children,  /
sv          A.49 utt3: {C but } they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {C But } [ I see, + I am seeing ] women now wanting to stay home --   

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sv          B.62 utt2: {C but } still, {D you know, } after five years, it's like, first kid -- /
