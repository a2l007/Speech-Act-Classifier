qy^d          A.1 utt1:  I don't know if you feel the same  /
sv          A.1 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, {F uh, } two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, {D you know, } you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen  /
sv          A.1 utt3: or, {D you know, } in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.3 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + as far as a high school course, I ] could see it as, {F uh, } maybe a [ social, + {F uh, } sociology ] course --   

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  -- to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program  /
sv          A.5 utt2: # {C and } # --   

b          B.6 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- <Noise> to me, that's fine to have a student do that for {D like } [ four + {E or } even a year -- ] /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.9 utt1:  -- {C but } to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, [ I, + I'm ] not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {F Um. }  {D Well, } that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- as opposed to, {F uh, } mandatory. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:  Exactly. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.14 utt2:  A, - /
%          B.14 utt3: yeah,  /
aa          B.14 utt4: I kind of agree with that.  /
%          B.14 utt5: {F Uh, } I don't think, - /
sv          B.14 utt6: {D you know, } [ [ i-, + it, ] + [ they should have, + they should have ] ] the same rights as anyone else --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- {D you know. } /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Right <noise> <child_talking>. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  [ It shouldn't be, + {F uh, } anything shouldn't be ] mandatory, other than, I guess, {D like, } {F uh, } when you come to paying taxes or something like that.  /
sv          B.18 utt2:  {F Uh, } {C or } if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- {F uh, } people be more eager <<mispronounced>> to do it. /

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  And doing it for a purpose that they want.  /
sv          A.23 utt2:  The other thing is this,  /
sv          A.23 utt3: I have thought about this on many times when you get these, {F uh, } young troubled teenagers that, {F uh, } don't have {D like } the perspective [ of, + {F uh, } {F uh, } of ] the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems  /
sv          A.23 utt4: {C but } there are other people out in the community that may have problems.  /
sv          A.23 utt5: Then I can see it as {D like } maybe a probationary type of thing.  /
sv          A.23 utt6:  You have to do so much <noise> as # far as in # --   

b          B.24 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- community service now.  /
sv          A.25 utt2: If they were, {D you know, } [ th-, + abusive ] <noise> type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.27 utt1:  {C Or } if, {F uh, } they destroyed some property around the, {F uh, } area, then they would have [ to do, + {F uh, } to restore ] it and perhaps, {F uh, } work, {F uh, } for the community to beautify it or whatever  /
sv          A.27 utt2: {C but } --   

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  -- I could see that working in <noise>, {D you know, } cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or   <noise> whatever.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C And } [ that's, + I think ] they have done that  /
sd(^q)          A.29 utt3: {C and } judges have said {D well, } {D you know, } this is what you're going to get for <noise> [ a, + {D you know, } a ] [ misd-, + misdemeanor ] or something,  /
^q          A.29 utt4: you may end up having to do some kind of community service  /
sv          A.29 utt5: {C so } I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,  /
%          A.29 utt6: {C so } <noise>, -/  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
ba          B.30 utt2:  {F Uh, } that's a good idea.  /
sv          B.30 utt3:  {F Uh, } I think they should have more programs like that. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {C And } I think, {F uh, } us being taxpayers, we pay for, {F uh, } people that's in jail or --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  -- in trouble anyway. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Sure.  /

b^m          B.42 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, {F uh } -- /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  -- {C because } like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors -- /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qh          B.46 utt1:  -- {C so } why have someone in [ year-, + jail for a year ] or two for a misdemeanor.  /
sv          B.46 utt2: {C And } sometimes, {D you know, } putting them in jail doesn't really help --   

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- because there's nothing in there that would [ [ [ [ reb-, + rehabilitate ] + # re-, ] + # --

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  -- {C and then } when they get out, they, - /
sv          B.54 utt2: because they have this stigmatism of being in jail. -/  

sv          A.55 utt1:  {C And } there's a lot of anger, {D sure. } {D You know, } especially if they haven't went through treatment  /
sv          A.55 utt2: {C and } they dealt with other people in the, {F uh, } system of prisons which, {F uh, } [ you, + you ] always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself <laughter> next to you or whatever.  /
sv          A.55 utt3: I would say the crimes would probably be, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.55 utt4: if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,  /
sv          A.55 utt5: {C so } you're dealing with people, {F uh, } that may, {F uh, } be an influence later on  /
sv(^q)          A.55 utt6: {C and, } {F uh, } an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two  /
^q          A.55 utt7: {C but } I didn't get any rehabilitation -- /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  -- [ {C or, } + {F uh, } {D you know. } {C But } ] then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, {F uh, } that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program # out in # --
