o          A.1 utt1:   Okay,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: {F uh, } <breathing> <lipsmack> let me see, I've got two children.  /
%          A.1 utt3:  One is, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.1 utt4: both preschoolers,  /
sd          A.1 utt5: one is two  /
sd          A.1 utt6: {C and } one is, {F uh, } four. /  

b          B.2 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:   [ {C So, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> this is my first year off,  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C and } I've always worked, {F uh, } from the time that they were little  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {C and so } I decided to <breathing> hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and <breathing> spend some more time with them <laughter> which I hadn't been doing. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:   {D Well, } I think that's wonderful. /  

%          A.5 utt1:   {D So, } -/  

sd          B.6 utt1:   My children are in college. /  

b          A.7 utt1:   Oh. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:   {C But } I teach school  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C and } I teach, {F uh, } middle school age children. /  

b          A.9 utt1:   Oh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:   {C And so } I see a lot of, {F uh, } variation in what happens when kids are at home. /  

b          A.11 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:   {F Uh, } I have taught school ever since my children were little. /  

b          A.13 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:   {C But } the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C and } your holidays are, too. /  

b          A.15 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:   {C So } teaching, I think is [ a, + a ] good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:   {D Well, } that's what I was doing before,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: I was teaching for Richardson School District. /  

b          B.18 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.19 utt1:   {C And, } {F uh, } it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little. /  

b          B.20 utt1:   Right. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:   {C And } it's really hard. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:   {D Well, } with them being as young.  /
sv          B.22 utt2: It was much, much harder when mine were young. /  

b          A.23 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:   {C And, } {F uh, } I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, {F uh, } college work --   

b          A.25 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.26 utt1:   -- and his Master's degree --   

b          A.27 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.28 utt1:   -- and so forth,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: {C and so } it was a matter of somebody had to have a  ((   ))  <laughter> job. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:   That's right,  /
aa^r          A.29 utt2: that's right.   /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C And } that's what was kind of [ what, + where ] we were, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.29 utt4: [ we, + I ] really didn't have to work,  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C but } I felt like I really wanted to work. /  

b          B.30 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:   {C And } [ I felt, + I also felt ] like, boy, I was sure missing a lot  /
sd          A.31 utt2: {C and } they were growing so fast  /
sd(^q)          A.31 utt3: {C and } <breathing>, {D you know, } it's like, do I really need to work, {D you know? } /  

b          B.32 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:   [ {C And } I, + {C and } [ it, + that ] ] choice was there,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: I really didn't have to  /
sd          A.33 utt3: {C and, } <breathing> {D you know } <lipsmack>, so I did have that advantage there,  /
sv          A.33 utt4: {C but } it's different staying home <laughter> too, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.34 utt1:   Yes,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: it certainly is.  /
%          B.34 utt3: We, -/  

sv          A.35 utt1:   It's an adjustment to make, also. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:   {D Well, } I think that, {F uh, } we need to spend more family time together [ with, + with ] children today.  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {F Uh, } we made a point to spend a lot of quality time  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C and } the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were --   

b          A.37 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.38 utt1:   -- involved in, {D you know, } {D like, } {F uh, } through scouting or --   

b          A.39 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.40 utt1:   -- {D you know, } anything like that  /
sd          B.40 utt2: we participated.  /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C And, } {F uh, } we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now. /  

ba          A.41 utt1:   Wow, that's great. /  

%          B.42 utt1:   When, - /
%          B.42 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.42 utt3: when, {F uh, } the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together,  /
sd          B.42 utt4: {C but } we did always have breakfast together. /  

b          A.43 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:   {C So, } [ we, + we ] had supper together as much as possible,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: [ {C but } when it wasn't feasible, + {D you know, } {A we kind of kept a master calendar } --   

b          A.45 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:   -- {C and } when it wasn't feasible, ] {D well, } that was understandable,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: {C but } --   

b          A.47 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.48 utt1:   -- {F uh, } we've always tried to spend time to talk and, {F uh, } have some [ time, + together time ] <noise>  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {C and } we sat around the table,  /
sd          B.48 utt3: we didn't sit in front of a T V or --   

ba          A.49 utt1:   Wow, that's great. /  

+          B.50 utt1:   -- that kind of thing.  /
sd          B.50 utt2:  {C So } I think that's been important, because we do have a close family -- /  

b          A.51 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:   -- {C and } even though the kids are basically, {F uh, } grown, {F uh, } they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and --   

b          A.53 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.54 utt1:   -- {F uh, } have spoken before of, they want that kind of, {D you know, } situation for them [ [ when, + {D you know, } {C and } their children ] + when ] they marry and have children. /  

b          A.55 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          A.55 utt2: kind of goes on. /  

b          B.56 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:   They do what they see, {D you know. } /

aa          B.58 utt2:  They model  /
qy^d          B.58 utt3: {C and, } with the dysfunctional families today, I'm sure, [ with a, + as a ] schoolteacher also, you see --   

b          A.59 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.60 utt1:   -- what happens to these kids --   

b          A.61 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.62 utt1:   -- when these families never communicate  or they're dysfunctional as far as the, [ between, + ] {F uh, } {F oh, } second families, {F uh, } one parent families or --
