o          A.1 utt1:  Okay  /
qw          A.1 utt2: on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why? /  

sd          @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess I stand [ on, + {F uh, } on, ] probably ten for no, {F uh, } restrictions.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2: I, {F uh, } recently just moved to Texas from, {F uh, } South Dakota and Nebraska,  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: {C and } <inhaling> I guess in terms of gun control I've always, {F uh, } been raised with the, {F uh, } idea in the Constitution that, {F uh, } citizens had a right to bear arms,  /
sv          @B.2 utt4: {C and } I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, {F uh, } more, {F uh, } of a national defense, {F uh, } than anything else,  /
sv          @B.2 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } on the other hand, too, {F uh, } people then, {F uh, } needed to use firearms for, {F um, } survival in terms of, {F uh, } food -- /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa          A.3 utt2: true. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I was raised, {F uh, } {D you know, } hunting all the time,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: I lived on the farm, and, {F uh, } {D you know, } enjoy hunting  /

sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } I guess I have, {F uh, } some problems with, {F uh, } being restricted to, {F um, } owning a gun for, {D you know, } hunting purposes mainly. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, {F um, } eventually we may not be able to have that right any more. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.7 utt2: [ I can, + I can ] understand that.  /
sd          A.7 utt3:  I was raised in Oklahoma,  /
%          A.7 utt4: {C and } of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, {F uh, } - /
%          A.7 utt5: yeah,  /
%          A.7 utt6: the hunting and everything, - /
sd          A.7 utt7: {C and } I used to  ((   ))  things in my father and my husband having guns and all,  /
sd          A.7 utt8: {C and } [ I, + I ] [ did, + used ] to be all in favor of it,  /
sv          A.7 utt9: {C but } [ it's, + all of a sudden it's ] starting to get really scary with these gangs.  /
sd          A.7 utt10:  Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing.  /
sd          A.7 utt11:  {C But } because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight <laughter>. /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
sv          B.8 utt2: [ it, + {F uh, } moving to this area, of course it ] happens everywhere,  /
sv          B.8 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, {F uh, } in the midwest and then, {F uh, } moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings  /
sv          B.8 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } there seems like killing for no reason at all,  /
%          B.8 utt5: {C and, } {F uh. } -/  

sv          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.  /
sv          A.9 utt2:  There's always been a certain amount of crime in [ your, + {D you know, } your ] urban areas,  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C and } I know we lived in Chicago for seven years,  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } of course it was definitely there.  /
sd          A.9 utt5:  {C So } when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this.  /
sv          A.9 utt6:  [ It's, + {D you know, } it's ] just getting all of a sudden so  much worse.  /
sd          A.9 utt7:  I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, {F uh, } drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in.  /
sd          A.9 utt8:  I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs.  /
sd          A.9 utt9:  I don't know what the answer is.  /
sv          A.9 utt10: I know that it's scary,  /
sd          A.9 utt11: {C and } yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do,  /
sv          A.9 utt12: {C and } that's basically what the gun control would end up being. /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  [ I, + I ] think so,  /
sd          B.10 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] there's always [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + {F uh, } the ] old, {F uh, } saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough [ they'll, + they'll ] get one,  /
%          B.10 utt3: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and then, } ] {F uh. } -/  

aa          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } it's very true. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  It's not the law abiding citizen that, {D you know, } [ is, + is ] dangerous with the gun <laughter>.  /
sv          A.13 utt2: It's the ones that are going out and stealing it. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And } I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.  /
sv          A.15 utt2: {C And } I think that would almost have to go with armies, too.  /
sv          A.15 utt3:  {E I mean, } they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen. /  

aa          B.16 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.16 utt2: yeah,  /
ba          B.16 utt3: that's for sure. /  

sv(^q)          A.17 utt1:  {C Because } even if you said, okay,  /
^q          A.17 utt2: {D you know, } armed forces could have them,  /
sv          A.17 utt3: some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.18 utt2: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] {D you know, } {F uh, } I suppose, {F uh, } years ago, way back [ when, + {F uh, } when, ] {F uh, } they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, {F uh, } were fed up with the government, {F uh, } - /
sv          B.18 utt3: {C and } if they didn't have a way [ to, + {F uh, } to ] fight back <laughter> they would have been in big trouble. /  

aa          A.19 utt1:  That's very true <laughter>  /
aa^r          A.19 utt2: very true.  /
qh          A.19 utt3:  Who knows,  /
sv          A.19 utt4: we maybe want to overthrow the government <laughter>. /  

sv          B.20 utt1:  <Laughter> {D Well, } the way things are going. /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  <Laughter> I know,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: if somebody doesn't do something. /  

x          B.22 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

qo          A.23 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ what about, + {F uh, } what do you think of ] [ this, + this, ] {F uh, } law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, {F uh, } carry the gun, or [ buy, + {D you know, } actually purchase ] the gun? /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, {F uh, } every gun you [ ha-, + bought ] had to be licensed, I believe. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } that didn't bother me, {F uh, } too much,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {C and so, } I guess it depends, {F um, } if there are some statistics that show [ that, + {F uh, } that ] people, {F uh, } commit crimes on the spur of the moment. /
