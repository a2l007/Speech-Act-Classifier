o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

b^m          B.2 utt1:  Okay. /  

qo          A.3 utt1:  {D So, } what do you think about it?  /
%          A.3 utt2:  Should, -/  

sv          @B.4 utt1:  {F Um, } I like [ the idea of nursing homes [ as a, + as a ] growing choi-, + the choices you have in nursing homes ] now, whereas [ [ used to, + you used to ] have only, + you put, ] {D you know, } - /
sv          @B.4 utt2: [ when, + when ] people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves -- -/  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  -- {C and } there was no other choice.  /
sv          B.6 utt2:  You couldn't take them in your own home,  /
sv          B.6 utt3: then they went into a nursing home.  /
sv          B.6 utt4: {D You know, } maybe you lived too far away to care for them, /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  {C or } your daily job or whatever prevented it.  /
sd         B.8 utt2: {C But, } {F um, } I like the choices you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and [ have some, + basically have a ] independent life-style, but assisted care. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C And then } if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, {D you know, } {D like, } where they prepare their meals for them -- /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they still live somewhat independently  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {C but } they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, {D you know, } [ where some people can't, + where they're ] in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed, /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  {C and } they can't get around  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C but } then they have full care.  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {C But } I really like [ those, + those ] options now,  /
sd          B.16 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think about it more often because my husband's parents [ are, + they're ] very active right now,  /
sd          B.16 utt5: {C but } they're seventy-five [ and, + and ] seventy-two.  /
sd          B.16 utt6:  {C So, } that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things --   

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- because of their age. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yes.  /
sv          A.19 utt2:  {F Um, } [ it's, + it's ] funny  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C because, } {F um, } I know people [ at, + that ] are in all three, and people that work, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.19 utt4: I know someone that [ w-, + works ] in all three different stages like you said. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C And } I have known, {D you know, } people close to me that have been in all three,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C and } I have seen them {D like } go from where they're in an apartment building,  /
%          A.21 utt3: [ they, + we ] call it, {F um, } - /
sd          A.21 utt4: {D well, } we have high rises,  /
sd          A.21 utt5: {C and } it's just for elderly people, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.21 utt6: {C or } [ [ most of, + most of, ] + one of ] their spouses has already passed away. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And } it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And, } [ it's, + it's ] really nice to go and see them, {D you know, } where they can still get around and everything,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C and } they still, {D you know, } do their own thing,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C but } [ it's, + it's ] really nice to see them because, - /
%          A.25 utt4: {E I mean } sometimes, - /
sd          A.25 utt5: {D like } I had a great aunt,  /
sd          A.25 utt6: she lived with us for, {F um, } three months, [ {C and, } + because ] she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease.  /
sd          A.25 utt7:  {C And } I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,  /
sd          A.25 utt8: {C and } I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them [ to, + to ] actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  And to actually sit,  /
sv          A.27 utt2: {C so } it's really nice to see that. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.28 utt2: that's some of the things I would find important before [ I, + I ] would look into that for a person, [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] like you're saying, a good mix of people who have the same interests. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  [ And, + {F uh, } and ] the programs,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: [ here they have different, + {F uh, } besides just different levels within the same program, they have different ] types of programs.  /
sd          B.30 utt3:  They have several areas.  /
sd          B.30 utt4: They have one area in town where the people, - /
sd          B.30 utt5: I guess a lot of it comes with money.  /
sd          B.30 utt6: [ [ I, + this, ] + this ] one area is a bit more expensive,  /
sd          B.30 utt7: {C and } the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life.  /
sd          B.30 utt8: [ But, + but ] things that people where they have similar interests. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  Like you're saying,  /
sd          B.32 utt2: and the programs that they have, [ where, + where ] some of them will have dances once a week -- /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  -- {C and } some of them sponsor different crafts,  /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C and } they go to the arboretum to see things,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  [ {C And, } it'll, + [ {C or, } {D you know, } {C or } ] someone will ] transport them to a specific church, even though [ it's, + {D you know, } maybe it's ] thirty minutes away,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C because } [ it's a big, + {D you know, } Dallas area is a big ] metropolitan area. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C But } a lot of these places [ have, + have ] churches or [ have, + have ] individual transportation.  /
sd          B.38 utt2:  [ That's, + that's ] something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {C Because } [ I don't think a lot of people really, + even in the nice ones, and  even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't ] necessarily like it --   

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  -- because they're not in their own home. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  {C So } I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, {F um, } enjoyable for them.  [ That'd, + that'd ] be one thing I'd look for, along with the, {F uh, } health care aspects --   

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- to make sure [ they had, + {D you know, } that it was ] clean and that they had good doctors and nurses. /  

aa          A.47 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  {F Um, } I'm in college,  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] only twenty-one  /
sd          A.47 utt4: {C but } [ we had a spee-, + I had a speech ] class last semester,  /
sd          A.47 utt5: {C and } there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  {C And } I was so surprised to hear how many people, - /
sv          A.49 utt2: {D like } whenever they're in, {D you know, } the older people, they're {D like, } {F um, } fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because [ they, + {D you know, } they ] wander the halls.   

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  {C And } they get the wrong medicine, just because, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] aides or  whoever just give them the wrong medicine. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.53 utt1:  {C And so } many of them, {D you know, } are, -/  

^2          B.54 utt1:  Are overmedicated, too. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  Yes.  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C And } [ it was, + it was ] awful to hear [ what, + {D you know, } what ] some of these people really went through.  /
sd          A.55 utt3:  {C And } I forget the percentage of people [ that, + {D you know, } that ] she had said,  /
sd          A.55 utt4: {C and } [ this was, + {E I mean, } she did ] research on it and  everything. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          B.56 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt3: that's one of the things [ that, + that ] we don't think about as we get older, and [ the, + the ] money that it now requires to, {F uh, } be in one of these places.  /
sv          B.56 utt4:  Because some of these people that are just on social security, - /
sv         B.56 utt5:  and if they don't have any living relatives, - /
sv          B.56 utt6: perhaps they never had children  /
sv          B.56 utt7: {C or } if their children, {D you know, } passed away before they did --   

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  -- they can be in some places [ that are, + {D you know, } [ that, + that ] are ] not good. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.60 utt1:  {C Or } [ they, + they ] have very [ minimum, + minimal ] care  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {C and } [ the, + the ] care that they are getting, the people who are giving it [ are pro-, + are paid ] at a minimum wage,  /
sv          B.60 utt3: {C and } [ they just do-, + they don't ] care as much. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] like you said, [ they're trying to make it, + the caretakers in some cases are trying to make ] easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.64 utt1:  That certainly would be something [ to, + to ] watch for.  /
sv          B.64 utt2: {C Because } [ [ you've got, +  with some of them being, ] + some of these places can even be ] two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in,  ((   )) . /  

aa          A.65 utt1:  I know,  /
sv          A.65 utt2: [ {C and } some-, + {C and } sometimes ] they share a room,  /
sv          A.65 utt3: {C and } it's just a little cubbyhole, /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.67 utt1:  {C and } they share it with another person,  /
sv          A.67 utt2: {C and } they're still paying that much. /  

aa          B.68 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
%          B.68 utt2: {C so } you've, -/  

sv          A.69 utt1:  [ [ It, + it, ] + [ it just sometimes, it just seems ] ] ridiculous. /  

aa          B.70 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.70 utt2: you've got to really strike a balance in [ what kind of care, + what kind of level of care ] you need, and then [ what you can, + unfortunately what you can ] afford at the same time. /  

aa          A.71 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa^r          A.71 utt2: uh-huh,  /
aa          A.71 utt3: yeah.  /
sd          A.71 utt4:  {F Um, } I've been lucky,  /
sd          A.71 utt5: {D well, } my mom's, {F um, } parents, they're both [ in their, + in their, ] {F uh, } eighties,  /
sd          A.71 utt6: {C and } I was just home for spring break  /
sd(^q)          A.71 utt7: {C and } my grandma [ said something to me about, + she goes, ] {D well } maybe we'll just sell the house.  /
sd(^q)          A.71 utt8:  She said, it's getting too big for us to take care of.  /
sd(^q)          A.71 utt9: {C And } I was like, no,  /
^q          A.71 utt10: no,  /
^q          A.71 utt11: no, /  

x          B.72 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

^q          A.73 utt1:  stay in the house as long as you can. /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  {D Well, } {D like } there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.  /
sd          B.74 utt2:  I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, {F um, } was in a, - /
sd          B.74 utt3: [ it was a, + it was a ] housing division.  /
sd          B.74 utt4:  Each person had their own little bitty house --   

b          A.75 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+           B.76 utt1:  -- that they had built,  /
sd         B.76 utt2: {C and } it was, {F um, } supplemented,  /
sd          B.76 utt3: [ [ their, + they were, ] + most of them were ] on social security,  /
sd          B.76 utt4: {C and } they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government.  /
sd          B.76 utt5:  {C But } it was this little bitty one bedroom house,  /
sd          B.76 utt6: {C but } it was a separate house,  /
sd          B.76 utt7: {C and } they had a living room, and a bedroom and a kitchen,   

b          A.77 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.78 utt1:  and a bathroom.  /
sd          B.78 utt2: [ {C So } [ they still had, + they had, ] + {C and } they had ] people who came in who, {F um, } supervised, [ th-, + all these ] houses,  /
sd          B.78 utt3: were {D like } fifteen or  twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block. /  

b          A.79 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.80 utt1:  {C And } they had [ a, + a ] supervisory, {F um, } - /
sd          B.80 utt2: wasn't a house, really,  /
sd          B.80 utt3: [ it was, + it was ] more like, {F um, } a headquarters --   

sv          A.81 utt1:  It sounds like, {F uh, } an apartment or som-, -/  

+          B.82 utt1:  -- or something, anyway, where [ they, + they ] staffed it three shifts a day so that [ someone, + if they needed someone, ] they could ring  /
sd          B.82 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] someone,   

b          A.83 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  could come to their house. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  [ {C And } that, + {C and } they ] always cooked,  /
sd          B.86 utt2: then [ they had, + they had ] the choice, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.86 utt3: they lived in their own little house. /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         B.88 utt1:  They had their own possessions still in there, [ to some ex-, + {D you know, } some of them. ] /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.90 utt1:  {C And } they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own dinner,  /
sd          B.90 utt2: {C and } they always had somebody come in for lunch.  /
sd          B.90 utt3: {C But } [ they had people who did, + {D you know, } they didn't have to mess with ] the yard. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  They had people who did the yard,  /
sd          B.92 utt2: {C and } they had a maid [ that, + {F uh, } {F uh, } service ] that came in and cleaned everybody's house.  /
