sv(^q)          A.43 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, {F uh, } were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, {D well, } jeez, {D you know, } I'll go out and get a part-time job.  /
sv          A.43 utt3:  Got a part-time job  /
sv(^q)          A.43 utt4: {C and then } financially, they got themselves into {D well, } I'll have the boat,  /
