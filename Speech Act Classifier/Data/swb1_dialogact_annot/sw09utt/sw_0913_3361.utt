qo          A.1 utt2:  {D Well, } Carolyn, [ the, + {F uh, } one of the ] main things I'd [ like, + like ] to know is, {F uh, } how do you feel about [ the, + knowing about the ] environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth. /  

%          B.2 utt1:  {D Well. } -/  

qo          A.3 utt1:  What do you think would be required, and so forth? /  

^h          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } I'll tell you,  /
qy^d          B.4 utt2: [ I, + I ]  watched what went on, {F um, } with the TWENTY TWENTY show, {A I don't know if you saw that a few days ago <child_talking> } [ that, + that ] talked about nursing homes,  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } {D actually } they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,  /

qy          A.5 utt1:  {F Oh, } you knew of the <child_talking> homes, {D then. } /  

br          B.6 utt1:  -- Pardon? /  

qy^r          A.7 utt1:  You knew of the homes themselves? /

+          B.12 utt1:  -- {F uh, }  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C and } it was really revealing to see some of [ the, + {D you know, } the ] things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,  /
sd          B.12 utt3: {C so } I would definitely, <child_talking> {D you know, } want to really check things out and, {F uh, } <child_talking> go,  /
sv          B.12 utt4: I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, [ to, + to ] make sure that you went daily, {D you know } --   

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- and made sure that they were cared for,  /

bf          A.15 utt2:  I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it -- /

qo          A.17 utt2: {C but } how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole [ new, + new ] home situation? /  

nd          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } {D actually, } I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,  /

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- she ] got to the point where she was totally bedridden, [ and, + and ] {E I mean, } I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: I think that would be the, -/  

qo          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } how do you find that [ your, + your ] personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot  more for her than normal?  /
qy          A.29 utt2:  [ Does that, + does that ] cause any problems between the two of you? /  

ng          B.30 utt1:  {F Uh, } I wouldn't say any more than usual. /

sd          B.32 utt2: {E I mean, } I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to. /  

qy          A.33 utt1:  It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, <throat_clearing> at the level that you did before,  /
^g          A.33 utt2: isn't it? /  

ny          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.34 utt2: I think that's very true. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  {F Um, } on the other hand, it takes on almost [ a, + a ] switch of a mother child relationship. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  It is different. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  I had that almost similar situation.  /
sd          A.39 utt2:  My mother lives in an apartment with my sister -- /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I, except for the three or four months this summer, - /
sd          A.41 utt2: that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {C and, } of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled --   

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  -- to have her here with me,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C and } I spent every minute I could to be with her and, {F uh, } cooking foods for her, {D you know, } just to make [ her, + her ] life as though she were on vacation. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  {C But } somehow another, [ it, + that ] doesn't work between my mom and my sister,  /

h          A.45 utt4: I don't know,  /
sd          A.45 utt5: my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,  /
sd          A.45 utt6: {C and } my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there <laughter> -- /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  -- {C and } I guess it's just because they're there all the time. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  {C So }  [ it's, + it ] [ puts, + has put ] pressure on both of them from that point of view.  /
ba          A.49 utt2: {C So } [ that's, + that's ] kind of bad news.  /
sd          A.49 utt3:  {C And } by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home, <coughing>  /
sd          A.49 utt4: {C and } after all she has been a farmer's wife </noise> for sixty years -- /

b          B.50 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  -- {C and } now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  She's relatively happy,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C but } she doesn't like the food. /  

x          B.54 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.55 utt1:  {C And } when she <laughter> complains about the food --   

b          B.56 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

+          A.57 utt1:  -- then they kind of get angry with her. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  {C So, } that's another one of those things you have to solve. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

x          A.61 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.62 utt1:  {D Well, } that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,  /
sv          B.62 utt2: {C and then } go to something like that. /  

aa          A.63 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.63 utt2: after all, [ their, + their ] life is so totally different  /
sd          A.63 utt3: {C because } in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.65 utt1:  {E I mean, } you raised your own chickens,  /
sd          A.65 utt2: {C and } you killed your own hogs, I suppose,  /
sd          A.65 utt3: {C and then } [ they -- +   

b          B.66 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.67 utt1:  -- they ] had to store the meat in, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.67 utt2: I don't want to say barns,  /
sd          A.67 utt3: {C but } they  had regular little places [ they, + they ] would hang it, {D you know } --   

b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.69 utt1:  -- to cure it and so forth.  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] now, all of a sudden, it, {F uh, } comes in differently, <laughter>  /
sd          A.69 utt3: it tastes differently. /  

aa          B.70 utt1:  That's right. /
