sd          B.6 utt1:  [ We, + we ] tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more. /  

ba          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } jeez. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  [ [ They, + they're, ] + they're ] really bad for us.  /

x          A.9 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C and } we pretty much keep those maxed out. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } I was going to say that, that sounds [ like, + like ] pretty many.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  {C But } I see what you meant,  /

aa          B.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          B.16 utt3: {C and } it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  {F Oh, } sure. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  {F Um, } {C because, } see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you. /

na          B.22 utt1:  Exactly.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  The American Express was probably the worst, {F um, } because with the Gold card, - /

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

aa          A.27 utt1:  Exactly, {D you know, }  /
aa          A.27 utt2: [ I, + that's it,  /
sd          A.27 utt3: I ] really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,  /
sd          A.27 utt4: {C so } I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } [ then, + then ] I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and  one Visa,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C and } here, most of the stores will accept those,  /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C and } {D actually } I then got a Discover card since they pay you back. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          B.30 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt3: I had a Discover,  /
sd          B.30 utt4: {C and } that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, {F um, } closing.  /
sd          B.30 utt5: {F Um, } it really wasn't my choice, though.  /
sd          B.30 utt6: {E I mean, } [ I ended up having, + I ended up actually losing ] my credit cards. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {F Um, } I ended up going through a credit counseling service --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.33 utt2: uh-huh. /

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  [ {C So, } + {C and } ] I would prefer to keep it that way.  /

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd         A.43 utt3:  {D Actually } I pay off my cards every month.  /
sd          A.43 utt4:  Only once in my life have I not paid. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, [ if you, + if you ] paid off every month, you never have to worry about, {D well, } how much do I have to pay these guys, {D you know, } this month, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.44 utt2:  [ This, + ] you buy what you can afford.  /

sd          A.49 utt2: {C so } that --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- {D you know, } if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't --

+          B.60 utt1:  -- before we're completely out of the hole.  /
sv          B.60 utt2:  {C But } I think [ this, + they ] way the  whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt. /
