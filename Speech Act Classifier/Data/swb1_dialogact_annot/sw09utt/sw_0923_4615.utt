sd          @B.2 utt3: {C so } budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, {F uh } --

sd          B.6 utt2: {C So } [ we're, + we're ] starting to think about long term considerations.  College and retirement.  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  {C But } with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Sure. /

sd          A.9 utt4: {C so } that's kind of how we do it, {F uh, } from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {F Uh, } long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, {F uh, } with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans --

sv          A.15 utt4: {C so, } {F uh, } long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, {F uh, } it's automatically taken out.  /
sd          A.15 utt5:  {C So, } {F uh, } that works out much better for us,  /

sv(^q)          A.17 utt4: {C so } it leads you to kind of say {D well } I'm not going to take it out.  /
