o          A.1 utt1:   Okay,  /
qo          A.1 utt2: {F uh, } what do you consider an invasion of privacy? /  

sd^t          @B.2 utt1:   {F Uh, } I was just now told that's what the topic was  /
sv          @B.2 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I guess invasion of privacy, {F uh, } to me, for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards --   

b          @A.3 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:   -- for example.  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  {C And, } {F uh, } I guess recently one of the T V stations here, {F uh, } ran a series of, {F uh, } news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers.   

sv          A.5 utt1:   It's very easy. /  

+          B.6 utt1:   And use it  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } I was quite surprised at that.  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  I guess I can consider myself fortunate that, {F uh, } it never happened to me. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:   {D Now, } [ I've never, +   

sd          B.8 utt1:   I don't know what I'd really do if it did. /  

+          A.9 utt1:   I've never ] had that happen to me either.  /
qo          A.9 utt2: What do you think about places, - /
sd          A.9 utt3: {D like } I was in Michael's the other night and charged something,  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } they asked for my home phone even though, {D you know, } the charge had been approved.  /
qo          A.9 utt5:  What do you think of that? /  

^h          B.10 utt1:   {F Uh, } /  

qy          A.11 utt1:   Does it bother you to give it? /  

nn          B.12 utt1:   No,  /
sd^e          B.12 utt2: not really because I'm listed in the phone book.  /
sd          B.12 utt3:  If I was the type of individual that, {F uh, } had an unlisted number, [ I, + I ] think I would be hesitant to give it. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:   You know that [ [ they, + they ] now have a, + {F uh, } I believe it's a ] federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:   One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, {F uh, } they did a lot of things with [ s-, + your Social ] Security number. /  

b          A.15 utt1:   Security number,  /
b          A.15 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:   As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license. /  

b          A.17 utt1:   Oh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:   {C And } they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C so } we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks. /  

b          A.19 utt1:   {F Uh, } uh-huh. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:   {C And } I was really, {D you know, } unhappy about that situation.  /
sv          B.20 utt2:  I think that was an invasion of privacy. /  

b^m          A.21 utt1:   Privacy,  /
aa          A.21 utt2: yes,  /
aa^r          A.21 utt3: yes.  /
aa          A.21 utt4:  I can see, {D you know, } where that was.  /
sd          A.21 utt5:  [ I, + I ] don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, {D you know, } when I have to cash a check.  /
sd          A.21 utt6:  I don't see any need for it when I'm charging something,  /
sd(^q)          A.21 utt7: {C but } [ I, + neither am I ] a person that <laughter> has the guts to say, no,  /
^q          A.21 utt8: I'm not going to give it to you, either <laughter>. /  

b          B.22 utt1:   Right. /  

%          A.23 utt1:   {D You know, } {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.24 utt1:   One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, {F uh, } mail lists and things like  that. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:   Yes,  /
aa^r          A.25 utt2: yes. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:   {D You know, } {F uh, } recently [ we, + {F uh, } I ] purchased some magazines, U S NEWS --   

b          A.27 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:   -- and FORBES magazine. /  

b          A.29 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:   {C And } every since that day, I have been inundated with, {D you  know, } {F uh, } subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, {F uh, } this news letter, this investment letter, {F uh, } even to the point of people calling me at home.  /
sd          B.30 utt2:  {C And } prior to me ordering these magazines, I never got those kind of calls. /  

b          A.31 utt1:   Right,  /
b^r          A.31 utt2: right. /  

%          B.32 utt1:   {C And, } -/  

sd          A.33 utt1:   I discovered with, {F uh, } charge cards, {F uh, } I feel like that I don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or  whether the, {F uh, } {F uh, } credit report bureau sells it,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: {C but } I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of. /  

b          B.34 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:   {C And } I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, {D you know. } /  

sv          B.36 utt1:   From [ some, + some ] list,  /
%          B.36 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:   From some list, {D you know, } that knows that I have [ a, + say a ] charge account [ at, + at ] Neiman's or something  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C because } then I'll get catalogs that, {D you know, } are within that range --   

b          B.38 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:   -- that I would never order from --   

b          B.40 utt1:   Right. /  

+          A.41 utt1:   -- ordinarily,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C and } ] [ I get, + I get ] tired of that.  /
sd          A.41 utt3: [ I, + {C because } I ] look at all that junk mail,  /
sv          A.41 utt4: {C and } I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up <laughter> --   

^2          B.42 utt1:   All their time. /  

+          A.43 utt1:   -- {D you know, } all their time to sort  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C and } they're not even paying full postage. /  

b          B.44 utt1:   Sure. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:   {D You know, } {C and } if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service. /  

sv          B.46 utt1:   I think the general public would be, {D you know, } {F uh, } tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, {F uh, } let's say the criminal individuals [ to, + to ] get access to people's records, {F uh, } their credit cards --   

b          A.47 utt1:   Right. /  

+          B.48 utt1:   -- driver's licenses, checks, things like that. /  

b          A.49 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:   {F Uh, } I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:   No,  /
aa^r          A.51 utt2: no. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:   Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure. /  

ad          A.53 utt1:   {D Well, } {D you know, } let's face it,  /
sv          A.53 utt2: computers can be gotten into very easily [ [ if you, + if you really have [ the, + the ] know with all, ] + if you're, {D you know, } so inclined to, {F uh, } {F oh, } {A what do I want to say, } have ] the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that.   

b          B.54 utt1:   Sure. /  

+          A.55 utt1:   {D You know, } and have a basic knowledge,  /
sv          A.55 utt2: they're very easy to get into.  /
sv          A.55 utt3:  To tap into a system. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:   Seems as though they are,  /

b          A.57 utt1:   Uh-huh, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.57 utt2: and, {F uh, } which is scary,  /
sv          A.57 utt3: {E I mean, } {D you know, } our lives are on computers. /  

ba          B.58 utt1:   Unfortunately. /  

h          A.59 utt1:   [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I don't know,  /
