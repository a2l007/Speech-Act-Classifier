REMARKS:        Both speakers spoke over each other quite a bit.  

==========================================================================
    
sv          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } the first thing for me is [ I wonder, +  I see ] a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, {F um, } if [ privacy is  something that disturbs your private state, +  {E I mean } an invasion of privacy  is something that disturbs your private state, ]  /
sv          A.1 utt2: that's one thing,  /
sv          A.1 utt3: {C and } if privacy is  something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something out about you that's another.  /
sv          A.1 utt4:  {C And } [ the first  kind of invasion of, +  the first type of privacy ]  seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in this country,  /
sv          A.1 utt5: {C but } in the second time, at least  overtly, {F uh, } where someone comes in and, {F uh, } finds out information about you  that should be private, {F uh, } does not seem, {F uh, } {F um, } obviously, everyday. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  [ I, + I ] think I agree with that.  /
sv          @B.2 utt2:  I think in a good  example on the typical thing that happens, {F uh, } when the phone rang  /
sd          @B.2 utt3: {C and }  it's T I calling,  /
sd          @B.2 utt4: my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message  /
sd(^q)          @B.2 utt5:  {C and then } I realize, {F oh, } {D no, } this is something I solicited, /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  That's right <laughter>. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {C so } my immediate reaction was one of that sense  of invasion  /
sd(^q)          B.4 utt2: {C but } after that I realized, {D no, } [ I, + I ] really wanted  this  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } it was sort of exciting  /
sv          B.4 utt4: {C and so, }    

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  that was almost an example of [ s-, + ]  an invasion that turns out to be not invasive. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  Right,  /
bf          A.7 utt2: it turned out to be, {F uh, } {F uh, } an invitation. /  

aa          B.8 utt1:  Exactly.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {F Uh, } {C and } at the same time  I think that I receive [ on, + on ] the order of, {F uh, } probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature  where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it. /  

qr          A.9 utt1:  [ From, + from ]  personal parties or from these, {F um, } [ phone answer, + phone, {F uh, }   

sd          B.10 utt1:  Commercial,   

+          A.11 utt1:  commercial ] things. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  [ sol-, + solicitations ] primarily. /  

ba          A.13 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ that, + that's ] a remarkable number.  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  I get them rarely  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and } I'm still astounded [ that, + that ] one, they let  anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever <laughter>.  /
sd          A.13 utt4:  {F Um, } {C because }  I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what,   

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  they are.  /
sv          A.15 utt2:  I think they prey on  people's, {F um, } inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.  /
sv          A.15 utt3:   I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say,  /
sv          A.15 utt4: {C and then }  they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  {C And } I think that's what makes one feel  invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C and } [ you, +  one's ] feeling obligated,   

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  because of some sense [ of, + of ]  the way the ritual is played out. /  

aa          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa^r          A.19 utt2:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } [ that, + that ]  then ends up being [ the, + the ] most common example for me. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b^r          A.21 utt2:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {F Um, } I guess I'm not typically feeling  invaded in my privacy relative to [ this second, + this one ] that you raised. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C And } I don't think I would have thought  about that.  /
sv         B.24 utt2: I think that's a good idea on your part.  /
sd          B.24 utt3: I don't typically feel intruded [ on, + on ]  the things, {F uh, } the sense of finding out information. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {D Well, } presumably those who find out such  information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,  /
sv          A.25 utt2: {C and, }  {E I mean, } {D you know, }  the classic, {F oh, } I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever,  would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge.  /
sv          A.25 utt3:  {C So } there's, <lipsmack>,  things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know  about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,  /
sv          A.25 utt4: {C and } I can't talk about the second one other than [ [ to, + to, ] + to ]  generate paranoia <laughter>.  /
sv          A.25 utt5:  It's a surmise  /
sv          A.25 utt6: {C and, }   

sv          B.26 utt1:  [ To, + to ] surmise.  It is there. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.  /
sd          A.27 utt2:   I don't think I'd like the K G B [ is + ] monitoring my phone or anything like  that. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess, although, [ I, + ] {D well, }  that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is,   

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          A.29 utt2: yeah. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  because, {F uh, } if that's the case of a tree falling in the  forest  /
sv          B.30 utt2: {C and } I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh, /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {F Uh, }   

b          A.33 utt1:  uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.33 utt2: uh-huh. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  if your defining it in terms of information  gone even if it's something you don't know about it, {D well, } then I guess one could  assume one was invaded  /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C but } I don't feel invaded by it. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh, /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I don't,   

b          A.37 utt1:  uh-huh. /  

+          B.38 utt1:  have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of  things,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: I'm not sure why.  /
sv          B.38 utt3: {F Uh, } I guess it comes from a sense of  fact or facts  /
sd          B.38 utt4: {C and } if someone finds out something about me that is true, [ I, + I ]  don't have a sense of loss from that. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
qy^d          A.39 utt2: {D Well, } you must have a relatively  clean conscience then <laughter>. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Um, } [ the, + the ]  other side of that might be [ if, + if ] someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  Yes,  /
aa^r          A.41 utt2: yes,  /
sv          A.41 utt3: [ ev-, + ] more harmed or something. /  

%          B.42 utt1:  Bec-, - /
aa          B.42 utt2: right,  /
sv          B.42 utt3: because,   

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  you don't have anyway to turn it off.  /
%          B.44 utt2:  Tho-, - /
qy          B.44 utt3: did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together? /  

ny          A.45 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          A.45 utt2: I did.  /
sd          A.45 utt3:  I was just about to write a letter  when I heard they canceled it. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  That would be an example where my sense of threat  would be high because I would find that there be, [ cou-, + ] a good possibly that  their facts [ were, + were ] fantasy. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.47 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {C And then } I would feel not only invaded in the  sense that someone had obtained information [ from a, + ] that I would rather they  didn't  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {C and } that might be the sense of the spending pattern, for instance,   

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  [ that, + that ] I would have thought to be private.  /
sv          B.50 utt2:  {C But then } if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse  /
sv          B.50 utt3: [ {C so, } +      

aa          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /

+          B.52 utt1:  {C or } ] if my call rate [ of, + of ]  eight [ t-, + ] or so a week went up even higher because <laughter>,   

x          A.53 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.54 utt1:  {F uh, } someone [ had, + had, ] -/  

^2          A.55 utt1:  They had you pegged <laughter>. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.56 utt2:  {C And } the person who had takes  unsolicited phones calls and pays money - /
sv          B.56 utt3: {C and then } all of,   

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  a sudden you get your thirty a week because now,   

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  their advertising you.  /
aa          B.60 utt2: Right.  /
aa          B.60 utt3: Exactly. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.61 utt2: {C And, }  {F um, } one of the problems  with the Lotus data base was, {F um, } that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.  /
sd          A.61 utt3:  {E I mean, } they said they would give it out to only select  companies  /
sd          A.61 utt4: {C but, }  {F um, } {D you know, } just like software is only given out to customers,  /
sv          A.61 utt5: {E I mean, }  you can't believe that. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  Right.  /
aa^r          B.62 utt2: Right. /  

sv          A.63 utt1:  <Laughter> [ It would, + it would ]  be pirated  /
sv          A.63 utt2: {C and } they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering,  {D you know, } full cash price,   

b          B.64 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.65 utt1:  for it.  /
sv          A.65 utt2:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } you can't tell  it, what a company really has to do with it  /
sv          A.65 utt3: {C and } there's something rather ominous  about having virtually anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending habits are,  /
sv          A.65 utt4: [ [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] +  {C and } ]  that hacker just has to get [ in to, + in touch ] with the sneak thief  /
sv          A.65 utt5: {C and }  suddenly [ and then + ]  what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home. /  

aa          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.66 utt2: {C And } I guess that turns out to be the  basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling,   

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  threatened as a result [ of, + of ] it  /
sv          B.68 utt2: {C so, }     

aa          A.69 utt1:  Yes.  /
aa          A.69 utt2: Exactly. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  maybe that is [ a, + a ] little bit of what privacy is. /  

aa          A.71 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.71 utt2:  I also thought about it, [ was of, + ] {F uh, }  waiting to talk to you that, another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.  /
sv          A.71 utt3:   {C But } I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my  privacy.  /
sv          A.71 utt4: If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and  down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.73 utt1:  {C And } I realize [ that + that, ] {E I mean, } I can take  that for granted  /
sd          A.73 utt2: {C but } [ I used to, + I used to ] live in India  /
sd          A.73 utt3: {C and } things are quite different  there in terms of that.  /
sd          A.73 utt4: There's less of a sense of privacy.  /
sd          A.73 utt5:  In fact, it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy,  /
sd          A.73 utt6: certainly the language I know doesn't,    

ba          B.74 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's interesting. /  

+          A.75 utt1:  but just says a word for loneliness.  /
sd          A.75 utt2:   Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different. /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  [ {C But, } +  {C but } ]  no concept for wanting to be private. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.77 utt2:  [ It's, + it's ]  generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Okay. /  

%          A.79 utt1:  {F Um, } {C so } there's not, - /
sd          A.79 utt2: {E I mean, } doors don't have  latches on them.  /
sd          A.79 utt3: People don't tend to knock,  /
%          A.79 utt4: you just, - /
sd          A.79 utt5:   if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way  /
sd          A.79 utt6: [ you, + people ] walk in out  /
sd          A.79 utt7: {C and, }   [ as a, + as a ] westerner in India, [ and + ] I was often surprised,    

b          B.80 utt1:  Oh.  /
sv          B.80 utt2: [ [ That, + that ] would be, +   

+          A.81 utt1:  and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  That would be ] culturally shocking <laughter>. /  

aa          A.83 utt1:  {D You know, } it very much is.  /
sd          A.83 utt2:  {C But } on the other  hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic, /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.85 utt1:  {C and } people would leave,   

b          B.86 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.87 utt1:  me alone.  /
sv          A.87 utt2:  Whereas in this country where  everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic  [ you, + you ] violate [ the, + {F uh, } the ] norms [ of social, + of, {F um, } public ]  behavior.  /
sv          A.87 utt3: {F Um, } people start paying attention to you very much  /
sv(^q)          A.87 utt4: {C and } they start asking  questions and in the sense are [ [ invite-, + invade, ] + invading ]  your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, {D you know, } quote unquote,  you asked for it.  /
sv          A.87 utt5: {C But } it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms. /  

b          B.88 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          A.89 utt1:  [ And + ] which isn't [ of, + ]  always the case in all cultures,  /
sd          A.89 utt2: {C and } it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative. /  

aa          B.90 utt1:  [ Tha-, + that ] is true.  /
sd          B.90 utt2:   I haven't thought about that  /
sv          B.90 utt3:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] that it's fascinating [ to, + to ] think a lot of someone  who doesn't know how to say private. /
