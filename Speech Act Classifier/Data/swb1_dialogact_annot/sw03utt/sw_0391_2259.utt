sv          B.2 utt2: currently, I think they are a little restrictive.    {F Uh, } particularly for, {F uh, } certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.  /
sv          B.2 utt3:   {F Um, } I think we should permit, {F uh, } more immigration from eastern Europe,  for example, {F uh, } particularly [ the, + {F uh, } <inhaling> the ]  Jewish, {F uh, } <breathing>, {F uh, } people from Russia.  /
sv          B.2 utt4: I think we could permit more of them in than we have  permitted in the last, {F uh, } several years.  /
