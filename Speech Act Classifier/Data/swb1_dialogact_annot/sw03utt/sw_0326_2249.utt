qw          A.1 utt1:  Where do you live? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } in the Houston area. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  {D Well, } I used to.  /
sd          A.3 utt3: I lived there for a long time.  /
sd          A.3 utt4:   {C But } I'm now in Palo Alto, California which is, I think, the recycling capital of the world. /  

ba          B.4 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {C So, } we have many recycling activities  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {C and }  I'm, [ and + ] in full, {F uh, } support of all of them. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {F Oh, } we are too.  /
sd          B.6 utt2:  Our community is, {F uh, }  just starting to get organized about it.  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  They just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate  [ our, + our ] things and dump them off ourselves. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.8 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } it, -/  

ba          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } that's something  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C but } [ it, + it ] seems to  me that we've gotten a whole lot better, {F um, } cooperation out here, {F uh, }  by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.9 utt3:  {D actually } I don't think we pay very much extra at all too,  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C but } the, {F uh, } garbage men,   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  come by, {F uh, } on your regular garbage day and pick  up the recycling out at the curb. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  I think that's great.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  There's a few places in Houston  where they're trying that out.  /
qy^d          B.12 utt3:  I don't know [ if it's, the, +    if they've done it ] citywide yet or not  where they have the color coded, {F uh, } bags and, {F uh, } bins. /  

ny          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.13 utt2: we have burlap sacks, /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C and } they give us one for aluminum  and, {F uh, } steel, one for metals,   

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  and one for glass,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C and then } you can either  bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  {C So, }  [ we have, +  we leave ] three little piles,   

x          B.18 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.19 utt1:  that  (( they need out ))  on the curb every  Thursday  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C and } the garbage men come by and, {F uh, } collect them and leave us new bags  when ours get old and  ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape. /  

ba          B.20 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  {C And, }  [ the, + it ] really pays for itself  because, {F oh, } then the city,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  gets the money from the recycling. /  

aa          B.24 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.24 utt2: [ we're, + we're ] all for it.  /
%          B.24 utt3:   Our,  {F um, } - /
sd          B.24 utt4: we've got several bins [ in our, + [ on, + in ] our ] garage where we, {F uh, } {D you know, }  sort things out [ and, + and ] take it [ to, + to ] the appropriate places. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: the one thing I wish we could recycle is magazines.  /
sd          A.25 utt3:  {C But } they claim that because of the way they're bound they,  {F uh, } it's too expensive to recycle them.  /
sd          A.25 utt4:  At my office,   

b          B.26 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where  everybody goes to pick up their mail,  /
%          A.27 utt2: {C and } they're,  {F uh, } - /
sd          A.27 utt3:  one's for white paper  /
sd          A.27 utt4: {C and } one's for colored paper  /
sd          A.27 utt5: {C so } anything like manuscripts or computer paper or  so-,   

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  things like that goes in those boxes,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {C but } we get tons of  catalogs and  things like that and magazines,  /
sv          A.29 utt3: {C and } there's no way to get  rid of them.  /
sv          A.29 utt4:  It just seems like such a waste. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  {F Oh, } it does.  /
aa^r          B.30 utt2: It does.  /
sv          B.30 utt3:  {C But } I'm sure that  they can, {F uh, } find some sort of, {F uh, } use for them if, {D you know, } {D you know, }   there, - /
sd          B.30 utt4: I've seen talk about, {F uh, } using garbage for, {F uh, } energy. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {C And so, } {D you know, } you could also apply the  magazines toward that. /  

ba          A.33 utt1:  {D Well, } that would be a help.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  I wish they would  do that here.  /
sv          A.33 utt3:  We have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run  out before the end of this decade. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          A.35 utt1:  {C And } it's really going to be a mess when they  have to start hunting for places to put the things. /  

aa          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know it. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  We did have, {F uh, } another novel, {F uh, } experiment  start this year.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  Now we can put all our yard clippings out. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  [ You can, +  you buy ] these super giant heavy-duty  paper bags,  /
sd          A.39 utt2: they're about four-feet high. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  {C And } you get them for I think it's about fifty cents  apiece at the grocery store you, {F um, } usually buy them by the dozen. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  {C And then } you put all your [ lar-, + ]  yard clippings and, {F uh, } leaf rakings and  anything that will be  (( compostible )) . /  

b          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  [ {C And } those + {C and } [ they, + the ] ] garbage men  also pick those up on Thursdays. /  

ba          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {C And then } [ the, + {F uh, } they ] take them to a special  part of our dump where (( composting ))  is now in full swing,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {C and } at the end of  every year, {F uh, } they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who  want to put it on their flower beds <laughter>. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Right,  /
ba          B.48 utt2: {D well, } that's a great idea.  /
sd          B.48 utt3:  I wish  we were  that, {F uh, } involved in,   {F uh, } or that our city was [ so involved in, +  that involved in ] recycling,   

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  like that  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C because, } {D you know, } I've talked to  many people  /
sd          B.50 utt3: {C and } we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it.  {F Uh, } /  

sv          A.51 utt1:  If they make it so that it's not a horrendous  inconvenience, I think most people would. /  

aa          B.52 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.52 utt2: {F oh, } yeah.   {D You know, }  /
sd          B.52 utt3: {C and }  I don't mind, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.52 utt4: at first it was [ the, + the ] little extra money that you got, {D you know, }  returning the cans in and stuff like that. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But } {D now, } {D you know, } I don't mind as long as  things are getting recycled, {D you know, }  that we don't get reimbursed. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  No,  /
sv          A.55 utt2: I think [ it's, + it's, ] to me more of a  convenience to have them come pick it up,   

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.57 utt1:  then to get that two cents when you take it to the store. /  

aa          B.58 utt1:  {F Oh, } [ I, + {F oh, } I ] know it. /  

sd          A.59 utt1:  We still have bins at the grocery stores  where you can turn in bottles and  cans,   

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  for cash.  /
sv          A.61 utt2: {C But } so few people, {F uh, } have enough  to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          B.62 utt2:  Yes.  /
sv          B.62 utt3: [ {C And then }  the, +  {C plus } the ] time that you waste standing in line is valuable also. /  

qy          A.63 utt1:  {D Now } do the grocery stores in Houston have  recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags? /  

%          B.64 utt1:  We have, - /
na          B.64 utt2: I know [ of one that, +   the one that ] we use, {F uh, } has, {F uh, } recycling for the bags. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] they're  promoting the cloth bags. {D You know, } the [ reus-, + reusable ] cloth bags. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.67 utt2: {D well, } we can get a nickel apiece  for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused. /  

ba          B.68 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  They just take it off like they do a coupon.  /
sd          A.69 utt2:    (( They can just ))  subtract it from your bill, /  

b          B.70 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.71 utt1:  {C and } they have a giant bin by the front  door for the plastic bags, /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.73 utt1:  {C and } they say, [ y-, + ] as long as it's clean  they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop <laughter>. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  Here they don't want your rotted tomatoes. /  

x          B.76 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C But } they want any clean and dry plastic  bag  /
%          A.77 utt2: {C so } I keep, - /
sd          A.77 utt3: {C and } the thing is, I hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving  it to recycle,  /
sd          A.77 utt4: {C so }  right outside the back door, I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles, /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  {C and } [ wi-, + ] there, right outside [ the, + that ]  place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers, /

sd          B.84 utt1:  {C And } he'll go pick them up  because he just can't stand that.  /

sd          B.88 utt1:  I remember at Christmas [ the, + the ] only thing that I'm, - /
sd          B.88 utt2:  when you were talking about the composting,  the only thing that our city did that was they [ di-, +  {F uh, } provided ] a place for us to take our Christmas trees.
