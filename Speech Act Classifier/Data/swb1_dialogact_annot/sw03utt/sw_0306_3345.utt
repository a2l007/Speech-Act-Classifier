b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.69 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, }   

b          B.70 utt1:  I see. /  

+          A.71 utt1:  It's, one of the reasons the U S [ wasn't so, + {D you know, }   didn't do ] more than they did at the time --    

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.73 utt1:  -- because they weren't all that excited about  him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,  /
%          A.73 utt2: [ {C but, }  + {F uh, } {C but } ]  then again, who, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.73 utt3: those people are so used to it  /
sv          A.73 utt4:  I guess it's the only thing that works. /

qo          B.74 utt2: {C so } what do you think about the quality  of news coverage in America? /  

sv          A.75 utt1:  I think it's pretty darned good,  /
sv          A.75 utt2: I think we're lucky to  have as good a coverage as we have -- /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  -- I really do.  /
sv          A.77 utt2:   {D Now, } [ I, + they ] sometimes they jump on it   [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] go a little to the extreme,  /
sv          A.77 utt3: the media does,  /
sv          A.77 utt4:  [ {C but, }  + {F uh, } {C but, } ]  that's kind of understandable, because, {D you know, } of course  if you watch it [ more, + more ] than once a day, {E I mean, } it's the same thing over and over and over   and over,  /
sd          A.77 utt5: {C and } I listen to the radio -- /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          B.78 utt2: right. /  

sv          A.79 utt1:  -- {C so } [ I, +  you ] hear so much,  /
sv          A.79 utt2: you get a little tired of  it,  /
sv          A.79 utt3: {C but } then again, so  many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe -- /  

b          B.80 utt1:  Yep. /  

sv          A.81 utt1:  -- {C but } I think the quality of  [ our, + {F uh, } our ] news  is just, {F uh, } I don't believe it could be better -- /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.83 utt1:  -- I really don't. /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ar          B.84 utt2: {D well, } {D you know, }  I think [ it probably could be, +  it always could be ] better,  /
aa          B.84 utt3: {C but } I,   

ar          A.85 utt1:  I # don't think so. # /  

+          B.86 utt1:  # would agree that # it's pretty good. /

qh          A.89 utt1:  {E [ I, + I ] mean, } {E I mean, }  what else could they do to make it better. /  

b          B.90 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          A.91 utt1:  I don't see anything that they could do. /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.92 utt2: {D well, } I think that, {F um,  } - /
h          B.92 utt3: I don't know. /  

sv          A.93 utt1:  {D Well, } you always --

aa          B.98 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.98 utt2: I think that, /  

sv          A.99 utt1:  {C But } by trial and error over the years, I think they got  it about as good as they're going to get it. /  

aa          B.100 utt1:  {D Well, } that may be so,  /
%          B.100 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          A.101 utt1:  {F Uh } --

aa          A.107 utt1:  {D Well, } that's true,  /
ba          A.107 utt2: I understand what you're saying,  /
sd          A.107 utt3:  {C and then } again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,  /
sv          A.107 utt4:  that's why we have C N N. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.109 utt1:  C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news --
