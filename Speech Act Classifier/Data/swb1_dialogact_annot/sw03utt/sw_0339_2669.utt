o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd^t          A.1 utt2: the topic was, should the United States  adopt the metric system, and  if so, should, {F uh. } -/  

qw^t          @B.2 utt1:  <Breathing>  How should they do it?  /
qw^t          @B.2 utt2:  Why didn't it work last time? /

sv          A.5 utt3:   I wish, {F uh, } it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up [ in the + --   

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  -- in the ] system that we've got that,  {D you know, } trying to convert over,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C and } I guess, [ what'd they try, + they tried ]  what'd the call it, soft conversion and  hard conversion -- -/  

aa          B.8 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          A.9 utt1:  -- one of them is where you just take  whatever's already standard  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and } you give it some sort of a weird metric number like  six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter. /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.10 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.10 utt3: direct conversion. /  

h          A.11 utt1:  [ I, + I ] don't know.  {F Uh. } /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  I think they [ [ just ought to, +  {D you know, } start, ] +   {F uh, } just go ] all the way on new products introduced or whatever, {D you know, }  start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {C and } {D you know, }  people if they have to are going to learn to  think that way. /  

qy^d          A.13 utt1:  {D Well } [ don't most of them, + doesn't just ]  about everything now have both metric and English. /  

na          B.14 utt1:  They do,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: {C but } things are generally packaged  in the English sized packages, {D you know. }  /
sv          B.14 utt3: You buy a quart of milk,  /
sv          B.14 utt4: {C and } sure it  [ has, + has ] the metric equivalent written on there,  /
sv          B.14 utt5: {C but } it still a quart. /  

aa          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
aa^r          A.15 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  {C But } if they started putting it in  liters, [ liter + ] of oil, and {D you know, } liters of gasoline, people are going to learn to think in  metric.  /
sv          B.16 utt2:  As long as you can still buy a product in the English units,  that's how you're going to think of it. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  I kind of remember back when gas prices  started up, {D you know, } pretty dramatically when they started getting toward  a dollar a gallon range,  /

sd          A.17 utt3: I believe it was Exxon -- /

sd(^q)          A.19 utt4: {C So } they could put this sign out front that said, {D you know, }  thirty-nine cents a liter. /  

b      B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C And } nobody had any idea what a liter was,  /

ba          B.22 utt1:  [ That, + that's ] the problem. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  When we finally out that liters was about  a quart, there's about four liters in a gallon  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C so } you can figure out what  you're actually paying for it. /  

aa          B.24 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  It's kind of hard for me to believe that  this day and age, - /
h          B.24 utt3: I don't know,  /
sd          B.24 utt4: when I was growing up, we were talking metric system in school.

+          B.26 utt1:  {E I mean, } [ not, + not ] at first,  /

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah.  /
b          A.27 utt2:  Oh. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  I would expect people with any kind of buying  power [ over the age, + {D you know, } under the age ] of thirty or so, to have some idea  what it is, anyway.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  A liter's about a quart. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  [ The, +  {F uh, }   I think maybe there's where the ] problem came in, {D you know. }  /
sv          A.29 utt2: We've tried to, instead of learning,  /
sv          A.29 utt3: it's kind of like  learning a language, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.29 utt4: when you learn one from the other,  you always end up in this conversion thing all the time. /

b          B.52 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C And then } some of them are done  in, {D you know, } purely metric. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: I remember that stink came around   in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns  /

sd          A.61 utt1:  I was with T I in El Salvador for a while,  /

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  {C So, } I had a little bit of experience  with it,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: {C and } also I noticed in Canada [ they, + {F uh, } you ] drop a quarter,  fifty cents, whatever, in a coke machine up there,  /

sd          A.95 utt6: {C and } it was built in Buffalo, New York.  /
sd          A.95 utt7:  {C But } it's got the  hardest combination of, {F uh, } metric  /
sd          A.95 utt8: {C and, } most of the body parts seem  to be metric,  /
sd          A.95 utt9: {C and } most of the engine parts seem to be S A E,  /
sd          A.95 utt10: {C so. } It's just crazy. /  

aa          B.96 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.96 utt2:  It just gets bad,  /
sv          B.96 utt3: {D now, } [ you got to, +  you got to ] have one, and not mix them up. /  

b          A.97 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.98 utt1:  {C Because } you're never going to get to [ one, + one ]  system if you still [ got a, + got a ] mix.  /
sv          B.98 utt2:  {C And } of course, here  [ that, +   that ] would involve changing road signs all across the country, {D you know, } miles per hour to  kilometers per hour, and  the whole nine yards.  /
sv          B.98 utt3:  Kind of hard to do gradually. /  

sd          A.99 utt1:  I thought maybe they would convert to, {F uh, }  metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit, because what is it --   

b          B.100 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.101 utt1:  -- fifty-six or fifty-seven's [ a hundred, + {F uh, }  [ qua-, + ] a hundred ] kilometers,  /
%          A.101 utt2: {C and } {D you know } -- -/  

sv          B.102 utt1:  {D Hell, } you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour. /  

aa          A.103 utt1:  -- yeah,  /
sv          A.103 utt2: you'd have,  /
sv          A.103 utt3: hundreds on the sign  looks lot better than fifty five,  /
aa          A.103 utt4: you'd have people going, {A you're right, } a hundred miles an hour. /  

b          B.104 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          A.105 utt1:  {C And, so. } I don't know,  /
%          A.105 utt2: I'd kind of, - /
sd          A.105 utt3:  {C and } the other thing, too, is, {D you know, }  between here and El Paso's, what, five hundred miles,  /
sd          A.105 utt4:  {C but } it's almost eight hundred kilometers, {D you know. }  /
sv          A.105 utt5:  That'd sure seems like a long way. /  

aa          B.106 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.106 utt2: {C but } [ they'd need, + they'd seem ]  to be ticking off faster, too. /  

aa          A.107 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.107 utt2: I guess that's it. /  

sv(^q)          B.108 utt1:  Every road sign you come to, is like, {D well }  I don't know it that far. /  

sd          A.109 utt1:  {D Well } they converted all the road signs to  fifty-five miles an hour, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.109 utt2:  they could've converted it to metric just about as easy. /  

aa          B.110 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.110 utt2: I think they, - /
sv          B.110 utt3:  you got the problem with all your cars are still, - /
%          B.110 utt4: yeah,  /
sv          B.110 utt5:  you still got cars on the road that don't have both. /  

b          A.111 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.112 utt1:  At that time, {D anyway, } that was still when  things were, - /
sv          B.112 utt2: the metric system was still not, -/  

^2          A.113 utt1:  Not all that common. /  

sv          B.114 utt1:  {D You know, } now cars, they have both.  /
sv          B.114 utt2:   Sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so  people start thinking that way. /  

sd          A.115 utt1:  I know the only other place that I was ever at  where they really had it mixed [ was, + was ] in Panama, where's a lot of the road  signs and everything are [ in, + in ] miles per hour  /
sd          A.115 utt2: {C and } some are in kilometers.  /
sd          A.115 utt3:   {C And } you got to know where you are --   

b          B.116 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.117 utt1:  -- because anything that was the old  canal zone is going to be miles per hour, /
