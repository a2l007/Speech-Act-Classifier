REMARKS:        There was an echo in the joint conversation.  
Speaker B had his T V on extremely loud and could be heard 
through the joint conversation and again in the third segment by
himself. 

==========================================================================
  

qw          A.1 utt1:  <Static> How do you usually keep up with current events? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  <TV> Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS  about an, </static> hour a day,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C and then } I supplement that with, {F uh, }  radio news from my car radio and  from a news magazine once a week,   

%          A.3 utt1:   Do you, -/  

+          B.4 utt1:  and a newspaper if I have time. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I don't usually have time to read the newspaper  everyday,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C so } I try to listen to the radio in the morning [ and, + and ] try to catch one  of the morning talk shows,  /
sd          A.5 utt4: {C and then } I usually end up flipping through  C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening.  /
sd          A.5 utt5:  I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of [ the, + the ] week's hot  events.  /
sd          A.5 utt6:  {C So, } [ I try to, + I try to ] catch that, if nothing else. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  That's true,  /
%          B.6 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] how do you rate  the,  {F uh, } - /
qy          B.6 utt3:  [ h-, + ]  are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving? /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  [ For, + for ] local news I think we do real well  where it's, - /
sd          A.7 utt2: we live in a kind of small town,  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C but } I think we get excellent local coverage,   (( {F um } )) ,  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C and } I like  the national news that we see,  /
sd          A.7 utt5: [ we, + we ] watch N B C  /
sv          A.7 utt6: {C and }  I think they do a real good job.  /
na          A.7 utt7: {C So, } [ I'm, + I've been ] real pleased with the  quality of the news we get,  /
qo          A.7 utt8: how about you? /  

sd          B.8 utt1: On the whole, I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. {F Um, } since I don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } I think I'm fed up with trite.  /
sv          B.10 utt2:  There seems to be  more and more of it,  /
sv          B.10 utt3: {C and } I understand the void that, {F uh, } comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations  /
sv          B.10 utt4: {C and } [ a-, +    

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  as ] expensive as they are to produce,  they certainly don't want any dead airspace. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.13 utt2: {C but } I think there's enough news out  there that they could pass on more factual information to us,  /
aa          A.13 utt3: {C and } like you said,  save the commentaries because I'm going to listen to [ the, + the ] news and  draw my own opinions.  /
sv          A.13 utt4:  I don't really need their help to do that. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  [ [ I, wo-, +  I, ] +  we're ] certainly in agreement there. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  I don't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of  different things that they need to get done.  /
sv          B.16 utt2:  [ They're, +  maybe they're ] a little more efficient,   

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  or have more to do over that same time frame. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  I don't know which that answer is.  /
sd          B.20 utt2:  {F Uh, } I think [ the, + my ] greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES.  /
qy          B.20 utt3:   Do you watch that? /  

ng          A.21 utt1:  I used to,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C but } I don't anymore,  maybe once or twice a year. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until  they did two programs,  (( {F uh } )) , that I knew both the people and the [ inc-, + incidences, ] /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  {C and } I knew that they had presented an extremely  slanted viewpoint,   

bh          A.25 utt1:  Really? /  

+          B.26 utt1:  that was, in my estimate,  nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And } it, ever since that time I just don't watch.  {F Uh, }  /
sv          B.28 utt2:  {C so, } I guess we have [ the, + the ] same reaction whether we came about  it from the same place or not. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.29 utt2:  {D Well, } I had heard a couple of people,  {D you know, } that I had talked to about certain programs say that, {D you know, }  they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the, {D you know, } news articles or whatever  [ they had, + they had ] already been familiar with.  /
sd          A.29 utt3: {C So, } I started questioning just  [ how, + how ] bias they really were,  /
%          A.29 utt4: {C so. } -/  

qw^d          B.30 utt1:  [ I don't know di-, +  I don't know how ] old you are,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C but }  it seems to me like the last, {F uh, } newscaster that presented news in just the nice  simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  <<Very faint>> {F Huh. } /  

qy^d          B.32 utt1:  {C So, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know if you're familiar  with him or not. /  

nn          A.33 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.33 utt2: not really, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.33 utt3: in the last few years  just his kind of informal segments I've seen  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C but } I never got to see his actual  nightly news.  /
%          A.33 utt5:  I liked, - /
sd          A.33 utt6:  [ I, + I ] did grow up with David Brinkley.  {F Uh, } /  

sv          B.34 utt1:  {D Well, } Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold,   

b          A.35 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  of Cronkite  /
sv          B.36 utt2: {C and } he did [ a, + a ] pretty good job.  /
sv          B.36 utt3:   THE HUNTLEY, BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent,   

aa          A.37 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: [ we, +   

+          B.38 utt1:  over the years. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  we ] used to watch, {F um, } him and I guess, John Chancellor.  /
sd          A.39 utt2:   {C And } I always liked David Brinkley  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {C and } [ I-, {C and } + I ]  used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting,  /
sd          A.39 utt4: {C but } on the nightly news, {D now, } he goes into his  commentary  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } that's where I [ get, + get ] into the problem  [ with, + with ] him.  /
sd          A.39 utt6:  I frequently disagree with his commentaries,  /
%          A.39 utt7: {C so. } -/  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {D Well, } once they've reported the facts,  all they can offer is an opinion anymore. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  Right.  /
qw          A.41 utt2:  What did you think of the news coverage of the war? /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {D Well, } I almost felt like it was too much.  /
sd          B.42 utt2:   Indeed, I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day,  one in the morning and one in the evening. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ i-, +  I ] spent a number of years in the service  as an intelligence analyst, /  

bh          A.45 utt1:  Really? /  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {C and } I don't need their fill-ins, {D you know } <laughter>. /  

qy          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter>  Did that help you understand a lot what was going on  [ your, + your ] prior experience with the military did, /  

ny          B.48 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          B.48 utt2: {C but } [ I, + I ] think it helps me everyday in  trying to review [ wh-, + ] the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going. /  

qy^d          A.49 utt1:  I wondered if it would help you sometimes  fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that [ other people, +   people like myself ] might not pick up on. /  

nd          B.50 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] think, {F uh, }  my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES. /  

bk          A.51 utt1:  Okay.  /
qw          A.51 utt2:  What weekly, {F um, } magazine do you look at,  /
%          A.51 utt3: is it, -/  

sd          B.52 utt1:  I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT.  /
sd          B.52 utt2:   At one time or another I've taken them all for a year. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  I believe in giving anything a chance. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } I keep coming back to that one,  /
sd          B.56 utt2: {C so, }  [ I, + ]  that's kind of my favorite. /  

qy          A.57 utt1:  Does that give a pretty good overview of everything  /
qrr          A.57 utt2:  {C or } {D like, }  does it give, {F um, } I guess, little encapsulated reports [ and, + and ]  then a few big stories? /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  It's primarily, {F um, } a few big stories and then  lots of high-level reports. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

^q          B.60 utt1:  {F Uh, } here's what went on in Asia over the past week,  /
sd          B.60 utt2:  {C and } there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was [ one of  their, +  the focus of their ] main stories. /  

sv          A.61 utt1:  That sounds good if you were short on time,  you could get a summary real quick. /  

%          B.62 utt1:  {F Uh, } it too is one those   ((   )) - /
sv          B.62 utt2: in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways,  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C and } I do most of my reading in the bathroom. /  

b          A.63 utt1:   Right. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } it's one of those that I can  [ ei-, +  read either ] an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {C And } it just seems to fit nicely,  so that I can get it read in about three days. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  {D Well, } we're working on a NEWSWEEK, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.67 utt2: for the last couple of months we got, {D you know, } an introductory subscription,  /
sd          A.67 utt3: {C so, }  we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS  ILLUSTRATED.  /
sd          A.67 utt4:  {C So, } we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us,  {D so } to speak. /  

sv          B.68 utt1:  {D Well, } to broaden your horizons,  make you think about different things anyway. /  

sv          A.69 utt1:  It can't hurt, <laughter>. /  

sv          B.70 utt1:  {D Well, } anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt. /  

aa          A.71 utt1:  No.  /
sd          A.71 utt2: [ [ I, + I  even, ] + I ] enjoy reading T NEWS,  /
sd          A.71 utt3: I try to  catch it because it's another example,  /
sd          A.71 utt4: [ they just, + they just ] show you the  words and the facts  /
sd          A.71 utt5: {C and }  [ they, + they ] don't offer any commentary,  /
sd          A.71 utt6: {C and } it gives me a  quick chance [ to, + to ] be caught up during the day. Because, {D you know, }  we don't listen to the radio at work at all.  /
sd          A.71 utt7:  {C So, } I don't like to go the whole day  without hearing anything. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  {F Oh, } I'm with you,  /
sd          B.72 utt2: I have to check T NEWS  [ every, + everyday. ]  /
sd          B.72 utt3:  It's my noontime dose of facts. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.73 utt2: {C and } the other thing we have that I like to  check sometimes is, {F um, } TALKING FINGERS,  /
qy          A.73 utt3: do you have that? /  

nn          B.74 utt1:  No. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  You have different telephone numbers that you can  dial,  /
sd          A.75 utt2: {C and then } you dial in an access code  /
sd          A.75 utt3: {C and } [ it will, +  depending on what topic you  called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will ] give you, {F um, } updated information.  /
sd          A.75 utt4: {D So, }  that can give you, {D you know, } current news updates, current weather updates, things like that  /
sd          A.75 utt5: {C and }  [ it's, + it's ] offered through the local phone company free of charge.  /
sd          A.75 utt6:  {C So, } that's,   

b          B.76 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

+          A.77 utt1:  an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use. /  

ba          B.78 utt1:  {D Well, } it does sound very interesting, /  

sd          A.79 utt1:   [ [ It, +   

sd          B.80 utt1:  maybe our phone company out here will get around to,   

+          A.81 utt1:   It ]  really is, +   

+          B.82 utt1:  offering something like that. /  

+          A.83 utt1:  {F yeah, } it really is ] nice, {E I mean, } because it gives  you a wide variety of things you can call and talk, and find out about.  /
ad          A.83 utt2:  {C So, } that is  something you might keep your eyes open for,  /
sv          A.83 utt3: I think [ it's, + it's ] catching on  throughout the country </TV>. /
