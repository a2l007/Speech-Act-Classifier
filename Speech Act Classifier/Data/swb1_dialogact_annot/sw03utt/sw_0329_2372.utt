sd          A.3 utt2: You and me both. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  <Laughter> It seems everything I do is computer related. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C And } if it goes down, then we're stuck all day. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  {C And  so } I like the I B M P C, personally. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C But } that's pretty much everything  I've worked with  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } I've become so  accustomed to it that, {F uh, } it's second nature. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qo          A.11 utt1:  What do you use? /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {D Well, } I have an, [ I, + I ] B M P S two, model thirty. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  It's [ kind of, + kind of ] getting too  slow for me,  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C but } [ my job, +  I'm ] an  (( E D P )) auditor,  /
sd          B.14 utt3: {C so } I audit, {F uh, } computer applications both  on the personal computer and the mainframe level. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } huh-uh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C And } I use my personal computer constantly,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: not only do I do P C type things like, {F uh, } using lotus or word processors, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe  terminal for our I B M mainframe --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {C So } all I have on my desk is my P C,  /
sd          B.22 utt2:  {C but } [  I'm, +  I'm ] getting, not only our local area network,  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C but } I'm getting two separate  mainframe machines, also. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay.  /
sd          A.23 utt2:  {C So } [ we, + {F um, } we ] use,  [ it's + ] an I B M P S two also. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And, }  {F um, } {D you know, }  every now and then the file gets so big, that, {D you know, }  it moves slower than I'd like -- /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  -- {C but } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] do mainly graphic work on it.    

b          B.28 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  And, {F uh, } a little bit of word processing  and then lotus applications to it. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          A.31 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: [ I just, + I ] enjoy   working with them. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah <<Voice faded>>. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  There's so many capabilities out there,  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {E I mean, }  the things you can do are endless. /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.34 utt2:  I've become kind of the P C guru in our  audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground, /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C And } there's three of us E D P auditors  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C and }  one of the three of us has an accounting background  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C and so } she's not real proficient  in P C's  /
sd          B.36 utt4: {C and } the other just has,   

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.38 utt1:  not used P C's that much,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C so } I ended up taking on  the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C and } I'm the administrator  for our local area network.  /
sd          B.38 utt4:  {C And } I need to keep that going  /
sd          B.38 utt5: {C and,    

b          A.39 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.40 utt1:  So, } [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I ] couldn't live my  life without a P C.  /
sd          B.40 utt2:  I don't have one at home, /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  We have one at home,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C but } I just don't find the  time that I can use it. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.42 utt2: Right now I would rather not have one at home,  because I would work at home. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Um, } we've got a couple of portable lap top  P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot,   

b          A.45 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  to do work.  /
sd          B.46 utt2:  If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night <laughter>.  /
x          B.46 utt3:  <<There are many breaks in the tape.>>    

sd          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter> One of the reasons why I got mine, was before I went on maternity leave,  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because, I am pretty much [ the, +  like you said, the ] guru,   

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  in the office with the different programs   and ((   ))  any trouble shooting that there is, /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  [ {C and, } + {F um, } {C so } ] they didn't know how it was  going to work,  /
sd          A.51 utt2: they knew they were going to have to get a modem  [ [ so that we could, +   ((   ))  in the decks machine  so that we could, in my home, ] +  so that we could ] make it  through  this eight weeks or so. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.53 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ]  almost like we could become too dependent on them. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  {C And } {F oh, } [ I, + we ] use a lot of free lance. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } that's, {F uh, } pretty much takes up a  lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.59 utt1:  {C And, }  {F um, } it, - /
sv          A.59 utt2: {F uh, } compared to the way  the things have upgraded,     

b          B.60 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  Have, {F uh, } really, - /
t1          A.61 utt2:  what's the word I'm looking for,  /
sd          A.61 utt3: I'm just totally drawing a blank <laughter>. /  

x          B.62 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.63 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } the way things have changed over  the years with the P C and the different programs is just great.  /
sv          A.63 utt2:  It's remarkable the things  we can do now, and compared to, {D you know, } a few years.    

b          B.64 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.65 utt1:  Just the power,  /
sd          A.65 utt2: [ I'm, + I'm ] trying to, {F uh, }  get an updated machine.  /
sd          A.65 utt3:  Mine, {F uh, } is just putting along <laughter>. /  

sv          B.66 utt1:  {C And } it's not fast enough for a new four eighty  six chip,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, }   

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.68 utt1:  I don't know <laughter> if my boss will spring for it. /  

x          A.69 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.70 utt1:  {C But } I'm determined to  brake mine  /
sd          B.70 utt2: {C so } he has to get me another one. /  

x          A.71 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.72 utt1:  We think about that a lot. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

sd          B.74 utt1:  {D Well, } that's what I do.  /
sd          B.74 utt2:  We had a printer,  a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.76 utt1:  {C And } we had about ten people sharing this  printer  /
sd          B.76 utt2: [ by, + ] it was attached to {D like } a central P C  /
sd          B.76 utt3: {C and } you had to take your  diskette to the P C to print something. /  

ba          A.77 utt1:  {F Um, } now that's awful. /  

sd(^q)          B.78 utt1:  {C So } the first thing <<voice has faded>>  when I started working at this bank, is, I said, {D well, } now first of all we need to all be able  to share this P C without getting up.  /
sd          B.78 utt2:  {C So } I talked my boss into  investing  in [ [ a, + it's not a, ] + {F uh, } a ] {F uh, } real elaborate local area network, /  

b          A.79 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.80 utt1:  {C but } we can share the printer  /
sd          B.80 utt2: {C and }  we can, {F uh, } send files to each other, /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          B.82 utt1:  {C And } we can [ mail, + send mail ] messages to each other,   

b          A.83 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  which is good enough,  /
sd          B.84 utt2: it's what we need. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  {C And then } I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet. /  

b          A.87 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes. /  

sd          B.88 utt1:  {C And } that was a major ordeal to  get him to buy it.  /
sd          B.88 utt2:  {C But } once he bought it, he has been so pleased.  /
sd          B.88 utt3:  [ It's, + it's ] fast,  /
%          B.88 utt4:   it's quite, - /
sd          B.88 utt5: {F oh, } it has  good copy. /  

aa          A.89 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          A.89 utt2:  The copy that you can  ((   ))   with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers. /  

aa          B.90 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.90 utt2:  I've got a [ little, + little, ]  {F uh, } I B M Pro Printer on my desk, /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  [ {C but, } + {C and } ] I can use either  the Pro Printer  /
sd          B.92 utt2: {C or } I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer.   The one that's on  the network or my own. /  

b          A.93 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.94 utt1:  {C So } if I just need something real quick,  [ and + ] I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed,  /
sd          B.94 utt2: I can just print it in my office. /  

sd          A.95 utt1:  {F Um, } we're just trying to talk ours into  getting a laser printer. /  

b          B.96 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.97 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, }  it's just so,  /
sd          A.97 utt2: the budget restraints and things like that, [ it's, +  makes ] it difficult  /
%          A.97 utt3: {C and, }  {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.98 utt1:  They have gotten really cheap.  /
sd          B.98 utt2:  Hewlett Packard makes, it's actually a dot matrix printer -- /  

b          A.99 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.100 utt1:  -- {C but } the quality is almost laser quality. /  

b          A.101 utt1:  {F Oh, } huh-uh. /  

sd          B.102 utt1:  {C And } I think it's called the desk jet  /
sd          B.102 utt2:  {C and } [ they're, + {A you understand, } I think they're ] about five hundred dollars now. /  

sd          A.103 utt1:  {C And } we, {F uh, } got a quote on some laser  printers the other day at six hundred dollars. /  

bh          B.104 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

ny          A.105 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.105 utt2: I don't remember what kind they were,  /
sd          A.105 utt3:  {C but, }  {F uh, } we do a lot of transparencies. /  

b          B.106 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.107 utt1:  Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.109 utt1:  {C So } they just want black and white,  which  ((   ))  {D see } we can just run them through the laser printer real quick.    

b          B.110 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.111 utt1:  Because it will only take a minute to print  one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it. /

sd^e          A.115 utt3:  If it was a customer presentation  then that would be different. /

sd          A.117 utt1:  We would want to razzle-dazzle a bit.  /

x          B.118 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.119 utt1:  And carry it over to there, and see if they're  not using the printer, /
