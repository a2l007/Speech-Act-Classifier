qo          A.1 utt1:  {C So, } Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research? /  

sv          @B.2 utt1:  I think [ we need, + we definitely need ]  more of it, definitely. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  I'd agree, too,  /
sv          A.3 utt2: {C but, } {E I mean, } it seems like it  just makes economic sense in that, {D you know, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  /
sv          A.3 utt3: it would have made  even better economic sense [ [ to, + to, ] +  to ] have had a lot more research  than a [ [ l-, + l-, ] + longer ] ago. /  

aa          B.4 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
aa^r          B.4 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          B.4 utt3: for certain. /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {D You know, } [ {C because, } + {D you know, } {C because, } ]  {F uh, } the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Exactly. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

aa^r          B.8 utt1:  Exactly.  /
qy          B.8 utt2:  [ [ Does, + does ] {D like, } +  [  d-, + do ] ]  health insurance policies, {D like, }  for companies and things, do they cover diseases like that? /  

na          A.9 utt1:  I think they cover AIDS,  /
sv          A.9 utt2: {C but } what they do is, {F uh, }  if, {D you know, } you apply [ [ for, +  for  ] + to ] get [ a, + a ] insurance policy --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- they'll, {F uh, } check to see if you're H I V  positive  /
sv          A.11 utt2: {C and } if you are, not only will they not give you, {F uh, } a policy,  /

sv          A.11 utt4:  there's {D like, } {D you know, } a database of people that have  tested positive,  /
sv          A.11 utt5: {C so }  you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ that's, + {C but } that's ] why they  should have [ s-, +  started ] doing stuff before.  /
sv          B.12 utt2: {E I mean, } still, {D you know, } since it's dormant  for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, {D you know, }  before the tests ever really came out --   

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  -- [  who are, + who are ] draining a lot of money  right now.  {D You know, } /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  I think a lot of it [ was, + was ] just that,  {D you know, } [ [ [ [ becau-, + because  of, ] + of  the, audi-, ] + {D you know, } because, ] + because ]  the majority of the high risk groups were people --   

b          B.16 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- no one really cared about. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  Right. /

sv          B.20 utt2: {C and } all these God-fearing people  were like, {D well, } {D you know } --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- God is trying to kill off all the   (( et cetera, et cetera )) . /

sv          B.34 utt5: {E I mean, } [ most of what gets raised, + {E I mean, } it's not really federal  movement,  most of what [ gets raised, + gets raised ] ]  by, {F uh, } {F uh, }  {D you know, } --

+          B.42 utt1:  And from corporations [ around the, + around the ]  city, {D you know, } for AIDS research and that kind of thing  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } I think  there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, {D you know, } rather than just  in the places [ where it's, + {D you know, } where it's ]   predominated so far, because [ it's, + {D you know } it's ] --

sv          B.54 utt4: {F uh, } [ I think, + I think ] one of the main things that's really important to  spend money on is education, not support [ or, + or, ] research  per se,  [ but, + but ] education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out  of society, {D you know, } kind of like lepers would --
