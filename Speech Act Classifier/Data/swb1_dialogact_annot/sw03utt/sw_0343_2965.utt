fp          A.1 utt1:  Hi,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: my last, {F uh, } auto repair was [ my, + my, ] {F uh, }  alternator went out.  /
sd          A.1 utt3: I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.1 utt4: it's a little Tercel <static>. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh <pounding>. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I have [ a fri-, + a friend ] whose real  good with, {F uh, } repairing cars  /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C so } I got him to take the alternator off and take it  and, {F uh, } {D you know, } get a replacement part. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {C So } we went to [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a ] place called  Quality Auto Parts  /
sd          A.5 utt2: [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] their parts are supposed to be guaranteed [ and, + and ] everything  /
sv          A.5 utt3: {C and }  [ they're, + they're, ] {F uh, } very reasonable.  /
sd          A.5 utt4:  {C So, } {F uh, } I bought the  alternator,  /
sd          A.5 utt5: we [ p-, +  put ] it on the car  /
sd          A.5 utt6: {C and } [ it, + it ] didn't work,  /
sd          A.5 utt7: {C and } it blew  out all the fuses. /  

ba          B.6 utt1:  {F Oh, } no <laughter>. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qw          B.8 utt1:  How much was the alternator? /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {F Uh, } I bel-, something like sixty-nine dollars,  [ som-, + something ] on that order. /  

qy          B.10 utt1:  [ Did he, + did he ] hook up the [ wir-, + wiring ] wrong? /  

nn          A.11 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.11 utt2: he hooked it up right.  /
sd          A.11 utt3:  [ It, + it ] was just  that [ the, + the ] part [ just, + just ] didn't fit the car,  /
sd          A.11 utt4: {C so. } I took it back  /
sd          A.11 utt5: {C and, }  {F uh, }  [ [ he, + he ] took the alter-, + the guy [ in, + in ] the parts shop took the alternator ]  /
sd          A.11 utt6: {C and } he put it  on the little thing he has in there to test them  /
sd          A.11 utt7: {C and, }  {F uh, } he said there  was nothing wrong with the alternator  /
sd          A.11 utt8: {C so } [ we, + we ] went back and tried it  again, put it on again  /
sd          A.11 utt9: {C and } it still didn't work,  /
sd          A.11 utt10: {C and } we took the car up to,  {F um, } a little place called Pep Boys,  /
qy^d          A.11 utt11: I don't know if you have them in your area -- /  

ny          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ] pretty reasonable,  {F uh, } car repair place also.  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C So, } {F uh, } [ took it up there, + towed it up there ]  because it, {D you know, } wouldn't start or anything  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and } this thing just kept blowing out  the fuses and, {F uh, } took them about [ an, + an ] hour to, {F um, } figure out [ what was, + what was ]  blowing the fuse,  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C and } [ it was, + it was ] the alternator that was  blowing the fuse.  /
sd          A.13 utt5:  {D Anyway, } <breathing> ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer  /
sd          A.13 utt6: {C and }  the only problem was that, {F uh, } it had to be a genuine Toyota, {F uh, }  alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, [ that, + that, ] {D you know, }  they sit in there and everything  /
sd          A.13 utt7: {C but } there's just some little  difference that, {F um, } causes it not to work an i-, -/  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sv          B.14 utt2: they probably built that in so they could make money. /  

aa          A.15 utt1:  [ Ye-, + yeah, ]  /
aa          A.15 utt2: I guess so  /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and } [ that was my, + that was my ]  last experience. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {D Well } I had a weird, - /
sd          B.16 utt2: there's a little sensing  device, {F uh, } [ in front of my, + {F uh, } <<pause>> {F um, } {A I'm not sure, }  right in front of ] the [ f-, + fan, ]  /
sd          B.16 utt3: [ it's a, + it's an ] air conditioner sensing device.  /
sd          B.16 utt4:  I don't know why,  /
sd          B.16 utt5: it actually, - /
sd          B.16 utt6:   there's a metal piece that fits through the  belts,  {F uh, }  /
sd          B.16 utt7: {C and } somehow that broke off  /
sd          B.16 utt8: {C and, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] still can't figure out how it  broke,  /
sd          B.16 utt9: {C and, }  {F uh, } anyway,  {C so } [ a-, + ] this piece obviously, {F um, } - /
sd          B.16 utt10: I have a Subaru,  /
sd          B.16 utt11: {C and, }  {F uh, } I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera,  /
%          B.16 utt12: {C so. } -/  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {F Uh, } this little sensing device costed like  sixty bucks <laughter>. /  

ba          A.19 utt1:  Goodness,  /
%          A.19 utt2: are you able, -/  

sd          B.20 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I haven't had too many  problems with my car,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: I got a eighty-eight Subaru, G L X T  /
%          B.20 utt3: {C and } it, -/  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:   {F uh, } {C and then, } {D you know } just basic  maintenance and oil changes  /
sd          B.22 utt2: [ {C an } I, +   {C and } I ] do not do my oil changes  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C and } I will not do  my oil changes.  /
sd          B.22 utt4:  [ I've, +   I think ] the first time I tried to do one and ended up, {F um, }  trying to ge-, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.22 utt5:  yo-, borrowed somebody else's jack  /
sd          B.22 utt6: {C and } I did this  /
sd          B.22 utt7:  {C and } I went and bought everything, /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  {C so } after buying the filter and all the oil,  you're looking at ten bucks at least,   

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  or somewhere in there  [ an, +  [ and, + {F uh, } and ] ] then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.28 utt1:  {C So } [ that, +  that's, ] {F um, } {D you know, }  <throat_clearing> - /
sd          B.28 utt2: as far as any maintenance on my car, [ I, + I ] shy away from the oil  changes,  /
ba          B.28 utt3: that's for sure. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sd          A.29 utt2: {D well } my car [ is, +  {F uh, }  it's ] an  eighty-six  /

sd          A.29 utt4:  {C and } the car now has a hundred and  thirty something thousand miles on it  /
sd          A.29 utt5: [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ]  this was just recent,  /
sd          A.29 utt6: {C so } I really can't complain about this one. /  

qw          B.30 utt1:  How did you put that many miles on it, in,   

sd          A.31 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ I used, +

sd          A.39 utt3:  I've only taken, {F uh, } maybe two trips that  were about four hours long [ dow-, + {F uh, } down ] to Shreveport.  /
sd          A.39 utt4:  {C And, }  {F uh, }  the rest of  it [ was, + {D you know, } it's ] just basically driving a long ways to work.  /

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {C But } I guess because they're highway miles,  {D you know, } it's not so bad on your car [ as, + as ] if it, {D you know, }  were just regular street, {D you know. } /
