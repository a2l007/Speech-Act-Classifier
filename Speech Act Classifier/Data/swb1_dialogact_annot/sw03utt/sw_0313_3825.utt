b          B.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.10 utt1:  {C And  then } they just sort of do {D like } a little  program or, {D you know, } something like that so  --   

b          B.11 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          A.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D well, } <laughter>  that's my husband's side and [ [ my mom, + my mom's, ] +  {E or } my family, ] {F uh, }  /

b          B.23 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.23 utt2: {D well, } my experience, {F uh, }  has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family. /  

b          A.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.25 utt1:  {F Uh, } years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's  side  /
sd          B.25 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } they haven't had a reunion since then.  /
sd          B.25 utt3: They just show up at  funerals and weddings. /  

b          A.26 utt1:  {F Oh } <laughter>. /  

sd          B.27 utt1:  It was pretty serious and lot of # yelling # --

+          B.29 utt1:  -- and all that,  /
sd          B.29 utt2: {C but, }  {D anyway, } my mother's side  we had [ our, + our ] first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer  /
sd          B.29 utt3: {C and } they had people  come in from out of town  /
sd          B.29 utt4: {C and } they took some rooms down at a  Holiday Inn  /

sd          B.29 utt6: they had a nice dinner planned and all of that  stuff  /
sd          B.29 utt7: {C and } people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree  /
sd          B.29 utt8:  {C and, } {D you know, } a lot of that sort of thing.  /
sd          B.29 utt9:  Since it was the first one that  we'd had [ that, +  you could do that ] once.  /
sd          B.29 utt10:  Now next time we have one,  /
sd          B.29 utt11: we'll have to think of something more creative to do. /  

sd          A.30 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } that's interesting because  one thing that always brings to my, {F uh, } husband's mother's side together is, {F uh, }  they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time  /
sd          A.30 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, } inevitably  everyone is just very interested  /
sd          A.30 utt3: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they always have,  {D you know, } two or three new ones to add to the list, {D you know, } someone's been born or --   

b          B.31 utt1:  {F Oh. } /

na          A.36 utt1:  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> I do, but not [ to, + very ] much  compared to my --

x          A.40 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.41 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } I suspect we'll do quite a bit more  genealogy  /
sd          B.41 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I ] suspect we will do more of it.  /
sd          B.41 utt3:  {F Uh, } I found [ out some, + about some ]  of the relatives [ [ I didn't, + {D you know, } I, ] + I ] didn't even know  their names, some of the --   

b          A.42 utt1:  {F Um. } /

sd          B.43 utt3: their really kind of  fascinating.  /
sd          B.43 utt4: I found out my grandmother was one of a twin. /  

b          A.44 utt1:  {F Oh. } /  

sd          B.45 utt1:  {C And } we don't even know where the twin, - /
