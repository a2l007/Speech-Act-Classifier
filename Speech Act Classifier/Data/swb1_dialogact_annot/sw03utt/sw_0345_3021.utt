aa          A.61 utt1:  No,  /

sv          B.68 utt1:  [ Th-, + the ] only way they could do it I think,  would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun. /  

aa          A.69 utt1:  Right,  /
aa^r          A.69 utt2: right. /

sv          B.76 utt1:  It would definitely be gun control <laughter>. /  

aa          A.77 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.77 utt2:  [ [ The, +  {F uh, } the, ] +  again the ] purpose of  gun control is to control how it is being used --
