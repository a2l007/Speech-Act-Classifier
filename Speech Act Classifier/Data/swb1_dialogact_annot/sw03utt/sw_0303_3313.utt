ny          B.2 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd^t          A.3 utt1:  We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States  and what can be done with it. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  That's a [ rather, + rather ] broad topic <laughter>. /  

sv          @A.5 utt1:  <Laughter> They're usually pretty broad anyway. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qw          A.7 utt1:  Where do you live? /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } we live in Plano. /  

bk          A.9 utt1:  Okay,  /
%          A.9 utt2: {D so, } that's a, -/  

qw          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and } where you are? /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  I'm in Richardson,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C so } --   

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  -- when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing  down at, {F uh, } Maceo High School --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  -- in Dallas. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Right,  /
ba          B.16 utt2: that is so frightening. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  It is, {D you know, } /  

qy          B.18 utt1:  {F Uh, } do you have children in school? /  

nn          A.19 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.19 utt2: mine are already in college now,  /
%          A.19 utt3: {C so } --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  -- I don't have to, - /
sd          A.21 utt2:  at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages. /  

%          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } I have, - /
sd          B.22 utt2:  my oldest is his first year in high school  /
sd          B.22 utt3: {C so } we have all this [ to, + to ] look forward to,  /
sv          B.22 utt4: {C and } it is really frightening,  {F uh, } to think that you can't even <breathing> send them to school in safety.  /
sv          B.22 utt5:  {E I mean, }  certainly,  {D you know, } you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,  /
sv          B.22 utt6:  {C but, }  {D you know, } <breathing>  when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, [ it, + it's ] really frightening. /  

aa          A.23 utt1:  That's true. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {C And, }  {F uh, } <breathing> I really,  {D you know, } - /
sd          B.24 utt2: they're coming down on the principal,  /
sd          B.24 utt3: {C but } I really don't know <breathing>  what they can do.  /
sv          B.24 utt4:  {E I mean, } it's just in so much of society with the violence  /
sv          B.24 utt5:  {C and } the kids having access to weapons and drugs  /
sd          B.24 utt6: {C and } [ I, + I ] really don't know  [ what, + what ] can be done. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {D well, } [ I just, + I just ] don't understand  [ how, +  {A of course, in my little world, } how ] guns could be so available. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {D Well } <breathing>, I don't either,  /
sv          B.26 utt2:  {C but } apparently they just really are.  /
sv          B.26 utt3:  {F Uh } <lipsmack>, {E I mean, } to me, in Plano you would think  that would be [ about, +  {D you know, } about ] as innocent as you  could get [ for + <breathing>, for ] being in [ a, + a ] large <breathing> area.  /
sd          B.26 utt4:  {C But, } {D you know, }  my son comes home and tells me that, {D you know, } he hears kids talk about having guns  /
sd          B.26 utt5:  {C and } <breathing>, {F uh, } someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun. /  

ba          A.27 utt1:  {F Oh, } my heavens. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {C And, }  {E I mean, } it just scared me to death  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  {C and, } {D you know, } they called the police  /
sd          B.28 utt3: [ {C and, }  + {C and } ] nothing happened,  /
sv          B.28 utt4: {C but }  my goodness <laughter>, {D you know, } [ it, + it ] could have easily. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } maybe that's the answer to crime is  getting <noise> more prosecution. /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Maybe so. /  

%          A.31 utt1:  {D You know, } {C because }   I don't, - /
sv         A.31 utt2: now [ I, +  somehow I ] feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen,  {D you know, } across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,  /
sv          A.31 utt3:  {C and } people don't do anything. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  A woman was raped in Richardson,  I read in the paper {F oh, } about a two weeks ago now.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:  {C And } all the neighbors said they heard  her yelling for help. /  

ba          B.34 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C But } [ nobody, + nobody ] did anything. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  I just can't imagine that. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {D You know, } {E I mean } they heard someone calling  for help.  /
sd(^q)          A.37 utt2:  Nobody even called the police to say, {D you know, } I hear a strange screaming -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Right. /  

%          A.39 utt1:  -- I'm afraid, {D you know, } if you, - /
sd          A.39 utt2:  I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {D well, } I can see, {D you know, }  especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe,  because, {D you know, } it could be dangerous,  /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C but } certainly I can't understand not calling the police. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.42 utt1:  I, -/  

%          A.43 utt1:  I just, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.43 utt2: [ it's, + it's ] really <noise>  frightening that [ we're not, + we're trying ] to live in our own little cocoons  /
sv          A.43 utt3:  {C and } probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          B.44 utt2:  {D Well } [ I, + I ] think you're right there.  /
sv          B.44 utt3:   I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,  /
sv          B.44 utt4: {C but } I think that's real dangerous  /
h          B.44 utt5: {C and, }  {F uh, } I don't know.  /
sd          B.44 utt6:  I try to tell my kids  [ just, + just ] kind of be aware of what's around them, {D you know }  /
sd          B.44 utt7: {C and } <breathing>,  if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just <breathing> get out of it  or call for help, whichever. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yes.  /  

%          B.46 utt1:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/  

b          A.47 utt1: Yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt2: {D well, } {D you know, } the  call for help is what scares me now because  [ it, + it just, ] - /
h          A.47 utt3: I don't know,  /
%          A.47 utt4:  people just don't, - /
h          A.47 utt5: I don't know,  /
sv          A.47 utt6: I can't say they don't care,  because people just have to care about another person. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  {C But } it's that not getting involved,  that impersonal society, I think we live in today. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  <Breathing> {D Well, } maybe this thing  [ with + <breathing>, with ] the child at school, maybe that will <lipsmack> make people think a bit  more {C and, } {D you know, } take some steps [ to, +  to ] correct it.  /
h          B.50 utt2:  I don't know,  /
sv          B.50 utt3: [ it's, + it ]  really [ is, + is ] frightening. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah <<very faint>>. /  

%          B.52 utt1:  I, {F uh, } -/  

co          A.53 utt1: Let me ask you,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, - /
qy^g          A.53 utt3: he didn't have a license for the gun,  correct? /  

no          B.54 utt1:  I don't know.  /
sd          B.54 utt2:  {E I mean, } I don't know the details.  /
sd          B.54 utt3:  This was not a child that was on the team.  /
sd          B.54 utt4:  It was someone that, {F uh, }  [ show-, + {D you know, } just kind of showed ] up at the field. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {F Uh, } it was [ a, + a ] student age  person,  /
