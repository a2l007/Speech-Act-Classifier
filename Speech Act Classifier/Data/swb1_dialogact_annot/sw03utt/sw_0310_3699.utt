sd          B.42 utt2: {C but, }  {F uh, } that ends up costing me. /

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.76 utt2: new ones, {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] tend [ to, + to ]  be real tiny,  [ but that + ] {F uh, } especially in newer neighborhoods,  /

sd          B.76 utt6: {C because } [ [ he, + he ]  was, +  {F um, } the house was ] going to  cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  {F Oh. } /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  {D Now, } that's because [ he was, + he's doing ]  a lot of it himself --

sd          B.82 utt2:   He was a little surprised. /  

ba          A.83 utt1:  {D You know, } that's interesting  /
sd          A.83 utt2: you say that,  because [ we do have, + we have ] those architectural codes here -- /  

b          B.84 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.85 utt1:  -- {C and } when we, {F um, } put out house in,  {F um, } they wanted us to have, - /

sd          A.89 utt4: {C and } they wanted us  to have more brick,  /
sd          A.89 utt5: {C so } we ended up having to go halfway up -- /

sd          A.91 utt3: {C but, }  of course at that point we couldn't afford it,  /
sd          A.91 utt4:  [ {C and, } + {C but, } ]  it's funny that you'd say that,   because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all. /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.93 utt1:  {C So } it's kind of like, they were. /

sd          A.101 utt2: {C and  so }   that's kind of why, I guess,  they stuck us with more brick when there were --   

b          B.102 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          A.103 utt1:  -- other homes that didn't have any. /  

sd          B.104 utt1:  {D Well, } {D see, } my sister kind of got in the opposite  end of that, because [ they, + they ] moved into a neighborhood and bought [ a, + a ] real nice  stone house down in South Austin. /
