sv          A.3 utt1:  I think it's somewhere really close to that cause I think  a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much  difference.  /
sv          A.3 utt2: {C And } they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {C Because } they feel like so many of the politicians  are {D like } crooked, {D you know? } /
