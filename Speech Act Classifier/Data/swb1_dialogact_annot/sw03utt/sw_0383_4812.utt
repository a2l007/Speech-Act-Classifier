sd          A.5 utt1:  I think that's pretty standard.  /

sv          B.16 utt1:  {C And } I guess the only <lipsmack> drawback I can see  [ to, + to ] drug testing is [ in, + in ] case you are on some sort of medication that might  give some, {F uh, } sort of false positive result --

sv          A.21 utt4: {C but } there's always  that margin of error. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] something to be  aware of.  /
sv          A.23 utt2: Another thing is, a lot of times, {D you know, } they aren't that accurate.  /
sv          A.23 utt3:  They aren't that  sensitive.  /
