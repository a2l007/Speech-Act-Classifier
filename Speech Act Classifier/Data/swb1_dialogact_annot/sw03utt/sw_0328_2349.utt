sd          @B.3 utt1:  {F Um, } [ I, + I ] understand that it's being  proposed as a requirement,   

b          A.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.5 utt1:  for, {F uh, } young people  [ to be, + to go ] into public service.  /

aa          A.6 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          A.6 utt2: [ all, + all ] young Americans,  they did not specify, {D you know, } exactly what young means. /  

b          B.7 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.7 utt2: yeah.  /
sv          B.7 utt3:  I think that it probably would  be [ a, + a ] good program.  /
sv          B.7 utt4:  I think probably two years is too long. /  

b          A.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.9 utt1:  I think maybe a year would be,   

b          A.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.11 utt1:  the longest. /  

aa          A.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.12 utt2: you're [ prob-, + probably ] right,  /
aa          A.12 utt3:  two years might be a little too long. /  

b          B.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.13 utt2: {C and } there will be a lot of  rebellion in that  /
sv          B.13 utt3: {C and } when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place,   

aa          A.14 utt1:  That's right.  /
aa          A.14 utt2:  [ That, +   

+          B.15 utt1:  I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody. /  

+          A.16 utt1:  that ] would be the problem. Sure would. /  

b          B.17 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.17 utt2: {C So } I think it would be a good thing though,   

b          A.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.19 utt1:  to encourage other people who aren't even  aware that they can do such a thing.    

b          A.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.21 utt1:  to get out there and do so. /  

aa          A.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.22 utt2: {C or } maybe offer them,  {D you know, } some sort of an incentive to do it.    

b          B.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.24 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D you know } college credit, {D you know, }  something, {D you know, } /  

b          B.25 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.26 utt1:  I'm not sure what  /
%          A.26 utt2: {C but, } -/  

aa          B.27 utt1:  Right.  /
aa          B.27 utt2:  College credit is a good idea because, -/  

sv          A.28 utt1:  I'm not sure they need to be, {D you know, } paid,  {D you know, }  /
sv          A.28 utt2: a super do salary of any kind. /  

b          B.29 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.30 utt1:  {C but } [ that, + that ] kind of takes away  from public service. /  

aa          B.31 utt1:  That's right <laughter>.  /
aa          B.31 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.31 utt3: they probably  couldn't do anything monetary,  /
sv          B.31 utt4: {C but } I think, [ giving, +   

sv(^q)          A.32 utt1:  {C But, }  just, {D you know, } to receive a letter in the mail,   

+          B.33 utt1:  giving ] some kind of college credit, -/  

+          A.34 utt1:  that says, {D you know, } [ you need to report somewhere  by next Monday, +  {D you know } you need to report somewhere by next Monday, ]  {D you know. }  /
sv          A.34 utt2:  I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea. /  

aa          B.35 utt1:  No,  /
sv          B.35 utt2: I don't think so either  because a lot of people, {F um, } depending on how the public service programs are set up  /
sd          B.35 utt3: {C and } I'm not that  familiar with them to know, /  

sd          A.36 utt1:  I'm not either really. /  

sv          B.37 utt1:  {C But, } {D you know, }  if, [ a, + a ] lot of people flat can't afford to. /  

aa          A.38 utt1:  That's right. /  

b          B.39 utt1:  {D You know, } /  

aa          A.40 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.41 utt1:  {C and } most kids these days have gotten  themselves into, {F uh, } financial situations,   

b          A.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.43 utt1:  where they have to be working all the time. /  

aa          A.44 utt1:  That's right.  /
aa          A.44 utt2:  Absolutely.  /
sv          A.44 utt3:  They need, [ you-, +   

sv          B.45 utt1:  {C So, } [ it's, + it's ] a really tough question. /  

+          A.46 utt1:  young ] families, whatever, /  

aa          B.47 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv         A.48 utt1:  they just couldn't, {D you know, } take off to do that. /  

b          B.49 utt1:  Yeah, /  

b          A.50 utt1:  Oh, /  

sv          B.51 utt1:  {C and, }  if you put them in public service  right out of high school, then [ that, + that ] postpones their college,   

aa          A.52 utt1:  That's right,  /
aa          A.52 utt2: uh-huh. /  

+          B.53 utt1:  for a year  /
sv          B.53 utt2: {C and } that would upset a lot of people too,   

aa          A.54 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          A.54 utt2: it sure would. /  

+          B.55 utt1:  because they just want to get on, -/  

sv          A.56 utt1:  It would have to be a lot of,  {D you know, } thought given to something like  that, I would think. /  

b          B.57 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.57 utt2: [ I, + {D you know, } I ] think it would  be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program, /  

b          A.58 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.59 utt1:  {C but } [ I, + I ] think it can't be something  that's mandatory. /  

aa          A.60 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa^r          A.60 utt2: Yeah. /  

sv          B.61 utt1:  it has to be something that's voluntary.   {D You know, } which is pretty much the way it is now.  /
%          B.61 utt2: They might, -/  

aa          A.62 utt1:  That's right.  /
sd          A.62 utt2:  I'm not even really sure at  this point in time, {D you know, } [ what, + what ] programs are out there. /  

aa          B.63 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.63 utt2: {C and } that's the other thing  is that, {D you know, } instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better.    

b          A.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.65 utt1:  and, {F uh, } {D you know, }  go to the schools and do programs,   

b          A.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.67 utt1:  and tell them that we need your help, and,    

b          A.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.69 utt1:  {D you know, } {F uh, } volunteer  for such and such a time, /  

b          A.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.71 utt1:  {C and } you've a choice of where you want to go. /  

b          A.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.73 utt1:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ that way, +   handling it that way ] they could probably get some results out of it. /  

aa          A.74 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.74 utt2: like maybe [ if, + if ] there was something  they could do [ in their  [ own, + own, ] + in their own ] town or city,    

aa          B.75 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          B.75 utt2: in their own community,  /
aa          B.75 utt3: right. /  

+          A.76 utt1:  {D yeah, } and not have to pull up roots  and, {D you know, } go somewhere half way around the world, or something. /  

aa          B.77 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.77 utt2: that's true <laughter>.  /
sv          B.77 utt3:  Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that.    

aa          A.78 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.79 utt1:  Although there are a lot of kids who would do it  just to get away from their parents <laughter>. /  

aa          A.80 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.80 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] true too.  /
aa^r          A.80 utt3:  That's true too. /  

sv          B.81 utt1:  {C But, }  they would have to be supported  in some way,  /
sv          B.81 utt2: {C and } I'm not sure that [ tho-, + those ] programs are available to do that. /  

aa          A.82 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.82 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.82 utt3:  Me neither.  /
qh          A.82 utt4: {C And, }  you wonder,  {D you know, } what kind of quality job would they do, {D you know, }   

b          B.83 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.84 utt1:  Just sit around for their year,  /
qh          A.84 utt2: {C or }  would they really, {D you know, } make a contribution of some kind. /  

aa          B.85 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.85 utt2: exactly. /  

b          A.86 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.86 utt2: it's tough.  /
sv^r          A.86 utt3:  It's tough. /  

aa          B.87 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^m          B.87 utt2: it is tough.  /
%          B.87 utt3:  It's, - /
sd          B.87 utt4: {C and } I don't know  who's even proposing it,   

b          A.88 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.89 utt1:  [ or, + or ] how they plan on implementing it,   

b          A.90 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.91 utt1:  if they do. /  

sd          A.92 utt1:  [ I, + I'm ] not sure either.  /
sv          A.92 utt2: {C But, }  I think,  there would have to be a lot more, {D you know, } information, {D you know, } disseminated,  before you say,   

b          B.93 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.94 utt1:  let's do this, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.95 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.95 utt2:  I think going to the schools would  be the easiest for them. /  

b          A.96 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.97 utt1:  {D You know, } it be, - /
sv          B.97 utt2: [ it wouldn't take  up [ much, + much, ] + it would take up more ] time than anything  /
sv          B.97 utt3: {C but } it wouldn't take up a lot of money. /  

b          A.98 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.99 utt1:  They wouldn't have to spend money advertising  and things like that. /  

aa          A.100 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa           A.100 utt2:  That's right. /  

sv          B.101 utt1:  You go to school  /
sv          B.101 utt2: {C and } you have a kind of a  captive audience,  /
sv          B.101 utt3: get them all in the auditorium, /  

b          A.102 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.103 utt1:  {C and } [ you, + you ] give them your  speech and maybe a little slide show or  something, /  

b          A.104 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.105 utt1:  {C and, }  I think,  that they could get some results from that,   

b          A.106 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.107 utt1:  because there are a lot of people who are volunteer  and community minded,  /
sv          B.107 utt2: {C but } they don't know where to go [ [ to, + to, ] +   

aa          A.108 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.109 utt1:  to ] do anything. /  

aa          A.110 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.110 utt2: That's a real waste too.  /
sv          A.110 utt3:  It really is. /  

aa          B.111 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.111 utt2: it is.  /
aa^r          B.111 utt3: It really is. /  

sd          A.112 utt1:  I don't really see the emphasis on things  like Peace Corps, {D like } [ we, + {D you know, } we ]  saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration, /  

b          B.113 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.114 utt1:  [ that was, + that was ] a big thing with him. /

aa^r          B.115 utt2: yeah. /  

sv         A.116 utt1:  {C And, }  [ I guess even back to Kennedy, +   as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy ] may be the one that actually started the thing, or was,  {D you know, } really interested in things like that. /  

b          B.117 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.118 utt1:  I just don't hear much about it anymore.  /
