qo          B.1 utt1:   {C So, } what do you think about it? /  

sd(^q)          A.2 utt1:   {D Well, } I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, {D well, } if there is a problem,   

b          B.3 utt1:   Right <laughter>. /  

+          A.4 utt1:  what should we do about it? /  

b          B.5 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sd          B.5 utt2: I guess that's so. /  

qy          A.6 utt1:   Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America? /  

na          @B.7 utt1:   {F Um, } {F uh, } I think there's some problems,  /
sv          @B.7 utt2: {C but } they're  not really big ones.  /
sv          @B.7 utt3:  I think that, {F um, } in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be.  /
sv          @B.7 utt4: That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America.  /
sv          @B.7 utt5: It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that. /  

bk          A.8 utt1:   Okay.  /
ba          A.8 utt2:  That's interesting.  /

sd          A.8 utt4: I'm a first generation American. /  

b          B.9 utt1:   Okay. /

b          B.13 utt1:   Okay. /  

+          A.14 utt1:   Or an immigrant mother anyway. /  

b          B.15 utt1:   Okay,  /
qw          B.15 utt2: {C so } where did your parents come from? /  

sd          A.16 utt1:   {F Uh, } Poland. /

sd          A.18 utt1:   {C And } that was, {D you know, } prior to World War Two. /  

b          B.19 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

aa          A.20 utt1:   {C But } it's interesting that, {D you know, }  with the topic I think I agree with you. /  

b          B.21 utt1:   Yeah. /  

sv          A.22 utt1:   There needs to be more of an open policy. /  

b          B.23 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.24 utt1:   {C And } {D you know } we have to remember the  Chinese came here and  were our labor, {D you know, } for the [ railroad, + Transatlantic  Railroad ]  /
sd          A.24 utt2: {C and, }   

aa          B.25 utt1:   Yep. /  

+          A.26 utt1:  our Irish came and, {D you know, } built the towns and,    

b          B.27 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.28 utt1:  did labor.  /
qw          A.28 utt2:  {C But } what do you think,  /
qy          A.28 utt3:  are you from  Texas  /

b          B.31 utt1:   Yeah. /  

ba          A.32 utt1:   {D Well, } that will be interesting. /  

b          B.33 utt1:   Right,  /
%          B.33 utt2: {C and, }  {F uh, }   

sd          A.34 utt1:   {C Because } we have just,   

+          B.35 utt1:  a lot of, -/  

+          A.36 utt1:  had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, {A I'm from Texas } --   

b          B.37 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          A.38 utt1:   -- [ and + ] have become citizens now. /  

b          B.39 utt1:   Yeah. /  

qo          A.40 utt1:   What do you think about that? /  

sv          B.41 utt1:   {F Um, } I think that's all right.  /
%          B.41 utt2: I,  {F um, } - /
sv          B.41 utt3: at least on  the surface it sounds like a good thing.  /
qy          B.41 utt4:  Do you have an opinion about it? /  

sd          A.42 utt1:   {D Well, } I agree with it wholeheartedly. /  

b          B.43 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.44 utt1:   The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey. /  

b          B.45 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd(^q)          A.46 utt1:   {C So, } when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to?  <laughter>. /  

nn          B.47 utt1:   No,  /
%          B.47 utt2: <laughter> okay. /  

sv          A.48 utt1:   {C Because } Texan philosophy is a little different. /  

b          B.49 utt1:   Right. /  

x          A.50 utt1:   <Laughter>.   

sd          B.51 utt1:   {D Well, } a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China.  /
sd          B.51 utt2:  {C And, }  {F um, } {D you know } he, {F um, } got a green  card [ is, +  and is ] in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always ((   ))  nice to the Chinese government,   

b          A.52 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

+          B.53 utt1:  and all that,  /
sd          B.53 utt2: {C and } he was always on pretty good terms with them. /  

b          A.54 utt1:   Yeah,  /
%          A.54 utt2: {D well } we, -/  

%          B.55 utt1:   {C But, }  {F um, } their, - /
sd          B.55 utt2: my sister just had a baby  /
sd          B.55 utt3:  {C and } they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to {D like } help care for the kid and that sort of thing.  /
sd          B.55 utt4:  {C And } it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem.  /
sd          B.55 utt5:  It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here. /  

qy^d          A.56 utt1:   {F Oh, } {D well, } then you have first in the experience on immigration. /  

ny          B.57 utt1:   Yeah. /  

ba          A.58 utt1:   {D Well, } that is interesting.  /

b          A.60 utt1:   Yeah.  /
sd          A.60 utt2: {D Well, } I wonder, {D you know, } even with  those that were involved with Tienamen's Square. /  

b          B.61 utt1:   Right. /  

qh          A.62 utt1:   {D You know, } did we really protect them? /  

b          B.63 utt1:   Yeah,  /
sv          B.63 utt2: [ that's, +  {C and } I think that's ] pretty crazy,   

b          A.64 utt1:   Yeah. /  

+          B.65 utt1:  because {E I mean }   those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back,  /
sv          B.65 utt2: {C and } aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China  /
sv          B.65 utt3: {C so } it's certainly in our best selfish interest  to keep them here if we can. /  

aa          A.66 utt1:   That is true.  /
aa^r          A.66 utt2:  That is true.  /
