b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         B.10 utt1:  {C And then } I like some classical music --

b          B.28 utt1:  No. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {F Um, } I have [ some, + some  ] rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western.  Some, {F uh, } {F oh, }  {A I can't believe I can't think of his name. } {F Um, } Garth Brooks, /

+          B.36 utt1:  -- music <laughter>.  /
sd          B.36 utt2: I never really listened to it because [ I, + {D you know, } I  ] prefer to have [ more, + ] I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to. /

sd          B.46 utt2: {C but, } {F um, } it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was  ((   ))  easy access,  /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C and } {D so } now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on --   

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.  /

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  -- it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having  [ a, + ] {D you know, } easy access to current music,  /
sd          B.50 utt2: [ {C and } + {C so } ] I did, like I say, tend to go back to albums and --   

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  -- cassettes and things that I [ had, + already had  ] --

sd^r          A.55 utt3:  I sure don't  /
sd          A.55 utt4: {C because } I have so many albums and cassettes I feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then start collecting C D -s,  /
%          A.55 utt5: {C and } it just, -/  

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  I haven't gotten around to doing it yet. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah,  /
 sd         B.58 utt2: [ I, + I  ] kind of decided to wait until [ it, + it  ] was around a while.  /
 sd         B.58 utt3:  It was kind of like, remember when personal calculators first <laughter> came out, /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.59 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C and } they were [ really, + really  ] expensive  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C and then } now you can get one for two or three dollars. /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  Just like V C R's, too <laughter>. /  

b         B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /

b          A.63 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: I thought of that, too, that if I wait, it'll get a lot less expensive,  /
sd          A.63 utt3: {C and } I can do without it for a while. /  

ba          B.64 utt1:  Sure  /
sv          B.64 utt2: {C and } also they get better quality -- /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 %         B.66 utt1:  -- w-, - /
sv          B.66 utt2: {C and } they learn to have more features and things  [ and -- + ]   

 b        A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 +         B.68 utt1:  -- without, [ and + ] making them less expensive.  /
  sd        B.68 utt2: {C So } we're kind of waiting to, {D like, } {F uh, } now, {D you know, } - /
 sd         B.68 utt3: {C and } the price of cassettes has gone down --   

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  -- because C D -s are so popular,  /
%          B.70 utt2: {C so, } -/  

%          A.71 utt1:  That's, - /
sd          A.71 utt2: {C and } a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too,  /
sd         A.71 utt3: right now, I think.   

sd          B.72 utt1:  I haven't even priced them.  /
sd          B.72 utt2:  I guess they must be. /  

+          A.73 utt1:  They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece. /  

bh          B.74 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

ny          A.75 utt1:  Yeah. /  

ba          B.76 utt1:  That is awful <laughter>. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Yeah  /
sd          A.77 utt2: <laughter>.  I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have C D players.  /
sd          A.77 utt3: I thought, my gosh, /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while. /  

o          B.80 utt1:  <Laughter> Take our time. -/  

b          A.81 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.82 utt1:  {D Well, } I can't imagine, {F um, } - /
sd          B.82 utt2: you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as {D like } a cassette player, where if you heard something, you could record it,   

b          A.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  {D you know. }  {F Uh, } [ if you have, I guess, + if  ] you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something,

sv          B.86 utt2: {C so } C D -s won't be nearly as handy. /

sd          A.87 utt3: {C so } I can record off other cassettes. /  

b          B.88 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.89 utt1:  {C But } I never realized you couldn't record onto C-, - /
sd          A.89 utt2: I just never really thought about it  /

sd          A.91 utt1:  {C and } I've never really looked at one very closely,  /
sd          A.91 utt2: {C but } [ that, + that  ] would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car.  /
sv          A.91 utt3: {D Now } [ I guess, +  {D you know, } one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess  ] all of them will probably have C D -s players by then, /  

b          B.92 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          A.93 utt1:  {C but, } {F uh, } I'm not planning on doing that for a while.   /
sd          A.93 utt2:  I just got mine paid off <laughter>. /
