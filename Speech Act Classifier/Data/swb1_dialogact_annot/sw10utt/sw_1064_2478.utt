%         A.22 utt9: {C and, } {F uh, } yeah,  /
sv          A.22 utt10: [ there, + there ] should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned. /

sd          B.25 utt1:  {D You know, } we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times,   

b          A.26 utt1:  Right. /

sv          A.32 utt1:  It may have started with HUD too.  /
sv         A.32 utt2:  I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape  /
%          A.32 utt3: {C and } that was property - /
sv          A.32 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } they lost a lot of money there,  /
sv          A.32 utt5: {C and then } some of these big, these rich people started to, - /
 sd         A.32 utt6: even Murchison here, who owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida.  /
sd          A.32 utt7:  This was several years ago  /

sd          A.34 utt1:  Not all of it,  /
h          A.34 utt2: I don't know how much he lost,  /
sv         A.34 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit  /
 sd         A.34 utt4: {C and } [ it always would, + it always would ] increase, {D you know, }  /
sd        A.34 utt5: it always would, {F uh, } {F uh, } be more than what you paid for it  /
sv        A.34 utt6: {C and } they just never even got conservative with our money at all. /  

b          B.35 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.35 utt2:  It, - /
sv          B.35 utt3: everyone forgets whose money it was. /  

b          A.36 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.37 utt1:  {C And, } everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word. /  

b          A.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.39 utt1:  I, - /
sv          B.39 utt2: as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action. /  

sd           A.40 utt1:  {D Well } {D now } the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, {F uh, } Reaganomics for, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.40 utt2: you spend your way to prosperity  /
sv         A.40 utt3: {C and } when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, {D well, } that was the philosophy, {D you know. }  /
sv          A.40 utt4:  Just keep spending until taxes are lower,  /
 sv         A.40 utt5: {C and, } I thought, that's not going to work, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.40 utt6: {C and } I knew that it wasn't going to work originally. /

   sv       A.48 utt4: {C and } apparently there was, {D you know, } /  

sv          B.49 utt1:  {D Well, } the problem is, - /
 sv         B.49 utt2: {C and } the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich. /  

b          A.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.51 utt1:  {C And, } for what they would cost - /
