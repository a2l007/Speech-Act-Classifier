b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  {C but } then in Vietnam that was totally different, {D you know, }  /

b          A.61 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {C but, } {D you know, } every week <laughter> it gets harder  /

sd          B.64 utt1:  {D you know, } {C so } that's a big, {F uh, } stress I think,    

b          A.65 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.66 utt1:  {D you know, } for the social changes in our family. /

sd          B.80 utt5: I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes,    

 b         A.81 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 +         B.82 utt1:  in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be,

aa          A.93 utt1:  Exactly, {F um. } /  

sv          B.94 utt1:  {C So, } that's kind of a difference for us.  /
sv          B.94 utt2:  I think there's more pressure [ to, {F um, } not necessarily a negative thing but + on my husband to  ] be more involved with the family. /  

b          A.95 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.96 utt1:  {C So } he's, -/

sv          B.98 utt3: you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,  /
sd          B.98 utt4: {C but } in terms of his amount of hours at work, nothing on that has lightened up. /  

b          A.99 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.100 utt1:  {C So, } it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer  /
%          B.100 utt2: {C and, } -/  

sv          A.101 utt1:  {C And } even, {D you know, } I think a lot of the movies we see now [ kind of, + kind of  ] play a good part in our changes  /
