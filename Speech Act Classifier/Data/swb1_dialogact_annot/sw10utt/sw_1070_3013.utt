o          A.1 utt1:  All right,  /
qw          A.1 utt2: what type of things would you  fix if you're having company come over? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I have a really great one that  I make in the summertime because it's cool  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C and } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ]  just really pretty easy.  /
sd          B.2 utt3:  It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {C And } I like that.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {F Uh, } the only thing you  have to do is cook the rice that goes [ in, + in ] it  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and then } [ I, + you're ]  supposed to do chicken,  /
sd          B.4 utt4: {C but } I just use those little cans of chicken. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C And } it makes it so much easier,  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and so }  you dump the rice,  /
sd          B.6 utt3: you dump the chicken  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C and then } you put in fruit like pineapple and  mandarin oranges and  grape,  /
sd          B.6 utt5: now grapes are the ones that you  have to pull all that off,  /
sd          B.6 utt6: {C but } I get my kids to do that,  /
%          B.6 utt7: {C so, } <laughter> -/  

sd          A.7 utt1:  Oh <laughter>. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  [ I, +  I ] don't have to do that.  /
%          B.8 utt2:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ] it really, - /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C and } you mix it all up with ye-, - /
sd          B.8 utt4:  there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,  /
sd          B.8 utt5: {C but } it's so simple  /
sd          B.8 utt6: {C and } it tastes  really good because it's cool in the summertime. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
qy          A.9 utt2:  You serve it cold? /

bk          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
ba          A.11 utt2: that sounds good. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: it has to sit in the fridge over night,  /
sv          B.12 utt3:  [ {C but, } + {C but } ] it's really good. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {C And } I like that one. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.15 utt2:  Usually when we entertain we do  something really simple, because I like to visit with my company,   

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.17 utt1:   and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C so, }    

b          B.18 utt1:  Exactly. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  a lot of times, we'll barbecue  /
sd          A.19 utt2: like,  {F uh, } for Memorial Day we had some friends over  /
sd          A.19 utt3: {C and } we just bought a brisket and  marinated it overnight in one of those {D like } Adolph's meat marinate,   

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  and put it on the smoker and cooked it. /  

ba          B.22 utt1:  {F Oh, } that sounds good. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And } [ tha-, + ] it was real good.  /
sd          A.23 utt2:  You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C and then } people think they're eating  steak or something <laughter>. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.24 utt2: yeah  /
qy^g          B.24 utt3: <laughter>.  {C And } these days that  helps, doesn't it? /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.25 utt2: yeah. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  It really does. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  I know what you mean. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  I don't usually  [ I + ] just pass on any recipe  that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  Now spaghetti's such an easy one.  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {F Um, } I do that a lot. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  I do spaghetti a lot. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: it seems like most people like spaghetti. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.34 utt2: I don't like to do that  [ i-, + if ] it's [ ho-, + real hot ] though. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          B.36 utt1:  {C Because, } {F um, } I don't know,  /
sd          B.36 utt2:  I have a real thing about being hot [ in the, + in the ] summertime. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  I guess. /  

sv       A.39 utt1:  {D Well } I think when you heat your kitchen  up it really makes a big difference,   

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.41 utt1:   in your whole house. /  

aa          B.42 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.42 utt2: I think that's right.  /
sd          B.42 utt3: {C And, } {F um, }  we don't entertain that often,  /
sd          B.42 utt4: {C but } when we do, I'm like you.  I like it to be fast and easy.    

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  And something so that we can talk [ and not + --   

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- and not ] have to worry about being  in the kitchen all the time. /  

%          A.47 utt1:  Most, - /
sd          A.47 utt2: we don't entertain {D like } people from  work or stuff [ e-, + ] often.  /
sd          A.47 utt3: It's usually friends from church and stuff, /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          A.49 utt1:  {C and } it's usually kind of like, you want to come  over, and they say {D well } what can we bring. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {C And so } it's real easy because you  just make one or two things  /
sd          A.51 utt2: {C and } everybody else brings something. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  That's exactly like us,  from our church, we just do it,  /
aa          B.52 utt2: yeah. /  

ba          A.53 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah,  /
b          A.53 utt2: yeah. /  

%          B.54 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  It's a lot more relaxing.  /
sd          A.55 utt2:   I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to [ m-, + ] {D you know, } put on this  really fancy dinner for someone. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {D Well } you see all that on T V  /
sd          B.56 utt2:  {C and } I could never be that person. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

%          B.58 utt1:  [ It just, + {F uh, } I'm just ]  not, - /
sd          B.58 utt2: {D well } [ I'm so, + I'm ]  pretty laid back. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah  /
%          A.59 utt2: w-, -/  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {C so }  [ I don't, + I know ] a lady in [ a, + ]  my church  /
sd          B.60 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } she {D like } does her own bread and does her own  stuff  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C and so } when she, {F um, } does food, she really goes all out  /
sd          B.60 utt4: {C and } I don't know  how she can do it and be calm <laughter>. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah  /
x          A.61 utt2: <laughter>.   

o          B.62 utt1:  I guess, /

ba          B.68 utt1:  {F Oh, } how exciting. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  {C So } hopefully, I think I'll  enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day.  /
sd          A.69 utt3: I don't like to come home and stand  in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up  /
sd          A.69 utt4:  {C and } by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,  /
%          A.69 utt5: {C so. } -/  

b          B.70 utt1:  Yeah.  /
