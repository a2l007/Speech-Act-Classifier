sd          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } I really enjoy reading the newspaper,  /
sd          A.1 utt2: we get the daily, {F uh, } DALLAS MORNING NEWS  /
sd          A.1 utt3: {C and } I try to look at it.  /
sd          A.1 utt4:  If I get busy <laughter> I don't get a chance to pick it up,  like this week I noticed  several copies [ have been un-, + haven't been touched ]  /
%          A.1 utt5: {C but } <talking>, -/  

qy          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } do you have time to read the paper in the morning? /

sd          A.3 utt3: {D well, } I have two children  /
sd          A.3 utt4: {C and } if they, {F uh, } go out to play or something I like to keep  my eye on them so I'll, {D you know, } maybe go outside and read the paper while  they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {D You know, } [ a lot, + a lot ]  of people don't take newspapers at all.  /
sd          B.4 utt2: [ We, + we ] took the MORNING NEWS for a while, /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C and then, } {F uh, } {D well, } we've been  taking the TIMES HERALD for ages  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and then, } {F uh, } dog just ran off with my shoe, <laughter>   {A that's off the subject, }   

x          A.7 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.8 utt1:  went outside, picked it up and ran off.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {D Anyway, }  {F uh, } {C and then } we switched the MORNING NEWS  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but } we found we couldn't  read enough of it  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C and } by the time I got home and had time [ to, + to ] read some, - /
qy^t          B.8 utt5:  [ {C but, } + {C but } ] I guess [ the, + the ]  issue is, {F uh, } beside the newspaper, do you take any news magazines? /  

ng          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } [ we, + I ] don't take, {D like }  TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that,  /

sd          A.9 utt5: {C and so } I will turn that on while I'm doing some work  /
sd          A.9 utt6: {C and } I can hear the news,  not have to sit right down and listen to it. /  

qy          B.10 utt1:  [ [ Did, + did you, ] + did you ]  hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about, {F uh, } Pete Arnett, and, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] news coverage? /  

na          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } <laughter> he didn't have too good of  opinion of it,  /
o          A.11 utt2: no, <breathing>  /
sd          A.11 utt3: {E I mean } yes I did hear that  /
sd          A.11 utt4: {C and so, } {F uh, }  I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {D Well } any, {D you know, } TIME  magazine and even the news that, - /
%          B.12 utt2: sometimes that, - /
sd          B.12 utt3:  that's why I like some diversity the  idea that, [ I, + we ] have TIME [ which, + which ] we take from time to time  /
%          B.12 utt4: {C and } we, - /
sd          B.12 utt5:  the problem is they call up and make this deal, {D you know, }  /

sd          B.14 utt3: I guess [ it's, + it ] comes out sporadically, like,    

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  twice a week or some-,  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C but } I think what's  interesting is [ [ that if you're, + that  there, ] + {F uh, } that as ] difficult  as it is, or [ as, + as ] much as they try, they put some bias,  /
sd          B.16 utt3:  I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group  /
sv          B.16 utt4: {C and } it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial. /  

%          A.17 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

%          B.18 utt1:  {C And } that, - /
sd(^q)          B.18 utt2: {C but, } [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, }  people accuse them of controlling the news he says, {D you know, }   we don't control the news we just report it [ the way we, + the way it ] is. /

sv          A.21 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I wouldn't think th-, + I would really say ]  that that's not true, because {F uh, } it seems like certain newspapers  always espouse certain candidates, /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {C and, so, } {F uh, } news stations always  tell the story from a certain angle  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C and } that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of  coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions.  /
sv          A.23 utt3:  You may never get the truth,  /
sv          A.23 utt4: {C but } you'll have a variety to choose from. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {C and } [ I, + I ]  thought that was particularly interesting in [ the, + the ] Gulf War, that there were pieces of  information [ that, + that ] were apparently, {F uh, } leaked just [ [ as a, + as, ] + as, {F uh, } a ]  ploy. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } I actually listen to C N N radio.   /

sd          A.35 utt2: my husband does  /
sd(^q)          A.35 utt3: {C and } it's how come  he usually calls me sometimes,

sv          B.40 utt2:  if you're around the home, though [ [ and, +  and, ] + and ] can watch T V and read the paper,  the problem [ is, + is ] that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is - /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C and then }  they start repeating everything. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

^h          B.42 utt3:  {A I don't think, } I'm trying to think if it's much local.  /
sd          B.42 utt4:  I listen to a little of that  /

na          A.55 utt1:  {D Well, } I really think so.  /
sd          A.55 utt2:  I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the, {F uh, } anchors, [ are + ] seem to be like  white Anglo Saxon protestant type people  /
sd          A.55 utt3: {C and } they all seem to be, {D you know, }  fairly similar  /
sd          A.55 utt4: {C and } I kind of prefer [  a, + ] {D you know, }   some females,  /
sd          A.55 utt5: I don't recall that they have any female  anchors  /
sd          A.55 utt6: {C and } [ I like different, + I like the ] anchors to be different kinds of people. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  I think that adds to the diversity,  /

sd          A.59 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } I prefer {D you know }  to have a little bit of variety like  that because I think [ you're, + you're ] more likely to get, -/  

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {C and } I think he has legitimate argument.  /

sd          B.60 utt4: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] grew up in Alabama  /

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  {C But } [ I think that, + I think ] [ that, + that ]  from [ a, + a ]  justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station. /

sv          B.64 utt2: {C but } I think that, {F uh, }  in some cases this should be some real opportunity  [ and, + and ]  some diversity,  [ and + --

 b         A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sv         B.68 utt1:  And, {F uh, } there for a few days and  watch the news [ and, + and ] think Dallas really does [ have, + have ] quite good news.  /

sv          B.76 utt3:  In fact, [ the, + the ] guy that was on,  the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, {F oh, } long time ago,   

b          A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
