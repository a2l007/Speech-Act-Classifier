qw          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } what kind of garden do you have? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } we've tried having, - /
^h          B.2 utt2: let me turn the T V off,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: we've tried having a vegetable garden,  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } I'm from Chicago,  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C and } the way that, {F uh, } bugs and weeds grow down here is very different <laughter> from Chicago.   

 x         A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.4 utt1:   /
sd         B.4 utt2: {C And } we have tried several years in a row,  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,  /
sd          B.4 utt4: {C and } we just kind of, {F uh, } decided to go with a few flowers and  give up on the vegetable garden <laughter>. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff. /

 b^r         A.7 utt2: uh-huh. /

sd          B.8 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } if you really water a lot, you can do it,  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but, } {D you know, } when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C So, } right now we're just, -/

x          B.22 utt1:  <Children_yelling>.

sd          B.32 utt1:  If you don't have a frost you'll be all right <laughter>. /  

x          A.33 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.34 utt1:  That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost  /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C and } half <laughter> the stuff would get frostbitten,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and } you'd have to. -/  

ba          A.35 utt1:  {D Well, } that's it.  /
sd          A.35 utt2:   Last year, I think it was, {D you know, } my peonies  [ were, + were,  ] budding in January,  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } there was no way that was going to make it,  /
sd          A.35 utt4: {C and } sure enough, {D you know, } we [ d-, + ] had really mild weather until --   

ba          B.36 utt1:  Wow. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- I think it was May or something -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- {C and then, } {D you know, } everything just got hit hard <laughter>. /  

ba          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } boy,  /
ba          B.40 utt2: that's frustrating. /  

%          A.41 utt1:  [ {C So, } + {C but }  ] yeah,  /
sd          A.41 utt2: [ it, + it's  ] interesting,  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {C and } I enjoy gardening.  /
sd          A.41 utt4:  My son does the mowing of the grass. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sd          B.42 utt2: my husband does that, thank goodness,  because [ I, + ] that's not a pleasure for me <laughter>. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  <Laughter> I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, [ the m-, + the mowing.  ] /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  I love gardens that are well tended,  /
%          B.44 utt2: {C and } I just, - /
sd          B.44 utt3: there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just n-, - /
sd          B.44 utt4: I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had [ a love, + {F uh, } a love  ] affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,  /
%          B.44 utt5: {C and } just, - /
sd         B.44 utt6: I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, {D you know, } year long.   /
sd          B.44 utt7: {C And, } {F uh, } <children> [ I, + I  ] was in England once,  /
sd          B.44 utt8: {C and } that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.  /
sd          B.44 utt9: {D You know, } it could be <child_yelling> three feet by four feet or something. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C So } I do admire that, but I haven't really put, {F uh, } too much energy into it. /  

x          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.48 utt1:  Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old <laughter>. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } they help you. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  {C So } that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and  laundry, I'll tell you <laughter>. /  

ba          A.51 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Oh } dear.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: {F Oh } {C but } that's nice, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.51 utt3: {E I mean } the peach tree [ is, + is  ] a start  /

%          B.52 utt1:  Tha-, - /
%          B.52 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.52 utt3: that's really lovely.  /
sd          B.52 utt4: I would love to have different fruit trees.  /
sd          B.52 utt5:  [ It's, + it's  ] been wonderful to have the peaches.  /
sd          B.52 utt6: They're just delicious.  /
sd          B.52 utt7: {C And, } [ [ we, + we  ] ha-, + we [ have, +  still have ] ] to spray some,  /
sd          B.52 utt8: {C but } we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,  /
%          B.52 utt9: {C because } <laughter> I just, - /
sv          B.52 utt10: I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Right.  /
qo          A.53 utt2:  What about tomatoes,  /
qy          A.53 utt3: aren't they pretty hardy? /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {F Um, } we've tried them,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C but } again, it's just like the sun scorch. /  

 b         A.55 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s-, - /
%          B.56 utt2:  {E I mean } it's just, - /
sv          B.56 utt3: you [ really, + really  ]   

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.58 utt1:  have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.  /
sd          B.58 utt2: People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation --   

b          A.59 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  -- and installed that,  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {C and } {F um, } that's really what makes the most sense,  /
sv          B.60 utt3: {C because } you don't have to use so much water,  /
%          B.60 utt4: {C and } -- -/  

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  -- it really does the job.  /
sd          B.62 utt2: {C But } it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. /  

 x         A.63 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.64 utt1:  {C And } if you're not really committed to it, - /
sd          B.64 utt2: {E I mean, } me, [ I'm, +  {D you know, } I'm ] real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,  /
sd(^q)          B.64 utt3: {C and then } I go, {F Oh, } yeah,  I need to do something,  /
sd          B.64 utt4: {C and } <laughter> by then it's burned up, {D you know. } /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,  /
sd         B.66 utt2: {C so } maybe when I get older <children> I'll find, {F uh, } some joy in that <laughter>. /  

 sv         A.67 utt1:  {D Well, } I would [ a-, + assume,  ] too,  /
 sv         A.67 utt2: {E I mean, } you've got three or four months you're talking about <laughter> --   

 b         B.68 utt1:  Yeah. /

b          B.70 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.70 utt2: it just gets so hot so fast here.  /
sd          B.70 utt3:  We don't have really a Spring or a Fall -- /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  -- {C and } it just, {F uh, } immediately heats up.  /
sd          B.72 utt2: {C So, } that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, {F um, } {D you know, }  the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.  /
sd          B.72 utt3: It was really nice. /  

 b         A.73 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         B.74 utt1:  We always had gardens when I was, {F uh, } living in Chicago.  /
  sd        B.74 utt2: In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard <laughter>,    

x          A.75 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

 +         B.76 utt1:  and redid it.  /
 sd         B.76 utt2: I'll never forget.  /
 sd         B.76 utt3: Got my stepfather to put in, {F uh, } a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.  /
sd          B.76 utt4:  {E I mean, } that was {D like } the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him <laughter>.  /
sd          B.76 utt5: They remodeled the entire back yard.   /
sd          B.76 utt6: Then they sold the house and got divorced,  /
sd          B.76 utt7: {C so } I don't know what that says about it all <laughter>. /  

ba          A.77 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } dear. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  {F Oh, } {C but } she used to love to do stuff like that. /  

ba          A.79 utt1:  Sounds like it would have been pretty. /  

b          B.80 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.80 utt2: it really was.  /
sd          B.80 utt3:  I enjoyed it there.  /
sd          B.80 utt4:  {C But } maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,  /
sd          B.80 utt5: {C because } they like to see things grow.  /
sd          B.80 utt6: They've done a couple of little seed projects,  /
sd          B.80 utt7: {C and so } I think it would be fun for them. /  

ba          A.81 utt1:  {F Oh, } sure,  /

sv          A.85 utt2: {C but } it's not off the list. /  

b          B.86 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.86 utt2: {D well, } it's very therapeutic,  /
sv          B.86 utt3: I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt,   

b          A.87 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          B.90 utt1:  It's just trying to keep anything.  /
sd          B.90 utt2:  I planted bulbs last, {F uh, } Fall on the side guard,  and when I went out there in the Spring  /
 sd         B.90 utt3: {C and } the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,  /
sd          B.90 utt4: {C and } the flower petals were scattered all over the walk <laughter>. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd(^q)          B.92 utt1:  He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with? /
