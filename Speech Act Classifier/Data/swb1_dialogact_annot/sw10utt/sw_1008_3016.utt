b^r          A.45 utt2: yeah,  /

ba          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow. /

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C So } that would be one way of doing it. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C but } one of my pet peeves, {A you came up with the telephone } is, when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message. /

sd          B.56 utt1:  I can't stand that. /

sd          B.58 utt1:  I think that is so stupid, {D you know, }  /
%          B.58 utt2: {C because, } -/  

sd          A.59 utt1:  {F Oh, } I'm guilty of that sometimes  /

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  {C And } it was sort of like, {F oh, } the hell,  /

+          A.65 utt1:  <Laughter> if I'm available.  /
sd          A.65 utt2:  The other thing [ that, + {F um, } that  ] there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when [ you, + you  ] use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.73 utt1:  We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number,  /
sd          A.73 utt2: {C but } it turned out  (( it had to have been ))  my husband's office phone number.  /

sd          A.81 utt2: same with my husband.  /
sd         A.81 utt3:  It was the charge card and social security number. /

sd          A.85 utt4: {C and } that was because I initiated it. /  

b          B.86 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          A.87 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and } occasionally I do order things from catalogs --
