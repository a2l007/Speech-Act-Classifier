sv          B.57 utt2: {D Now, } something that I <breathing> read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that [ the Arab, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, {D you know. } /

 b         A.62 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.63 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } we are now a legitimate player [ [ in the, + in the, ] + in the  ] game because we came in with a certain amount of force and [ we, + {D you know } we  ] defeated, - /

 b         A.66 utt1:  Right <TV>. /  

 sv         B.67 utt1:  -- that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit.  /
sv          B.67 utt2: It makes us more legitimate.  /
sv          B.67 utt3: {C So, } now what they're saying is that, {D well, } since we won whatever we say goes because it's, {F uh, } a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it  /

b          A.68 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.69 utt1:  Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there  /

sv          B.71 utt1:  [ {C And then, } + {C and then }  ] they could call the shots for the, {D you know, } period of time until the next strong man came up [ and, + {D you know } --   

b          A.72 utt1:  Right. /
