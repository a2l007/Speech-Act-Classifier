o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

o          B.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
qw          B.2 utt2:  What can we do about crime?  /
h          B.2 utt3:  I don't know.  /
sd          B.2 utt4:  The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that [ they're, + <child> they ] don't have enough space in the prisons to put people  /
sv          B.2 utt5: {C and } they keep letting out people that have, {D you know, } these horrible records. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  {C So } maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.  /
sv          B.4 utt2:  That's one thing I guess I could think of </child>. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } it's definitely a big concern, /  

x          A.7 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

%          B.8 utt1:  {E I mean } every day it's, {D you know, } all ar-, - /
sd          B.8 utt2: we live in a little small town,  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C and } there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time.  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C And } you just can't get away from it no matter where you live. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.9 utt2:  {D Well } I, -/  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C So } it's pretty scary. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  [ I'm, + I'm ] from Butler,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C and } I can't say that there's too much of that there. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {F Um, } I know the bigger cities have problems with it. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          A.15 utt1:  {F Uh, } I really don't know what we can do about it. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  Unless  --   

sv          B.18 utt1:  It's rough, because <noise>, -/  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- they start enforcing the, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.19 utt2: <<sounds like: t, t, t, t, t>> {F uh, } start giving more people death sentences.  /
sv          A.19 utt3:  That's the only thing <laughter> I can think of. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah.  /
b^r          B.20 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv        B.20 utt3: {D well } even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.  /
sv          B.20 utt4:  {E I mean } you hear about people, {D you know, } six and seven times have committed burglaries  /
sv          B.20 utt5: {C and } they're still, {D you know, } only serving six months in prison.  /
sv          B.20 utt6:  {C So } that's definitely something.  /
sv          B.20 utt7:  They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, {D you know, } from one month to ten years or something <child>. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  That would be one thing that, {D you know, } I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, {D you know, } for certain crimes </child>. /  

 b         A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b^r          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.25 utt1: [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.26 utt2:  {C And } one things that they're saying, now, - /
qy          B.26 utt3: are you going, - /
qy          B.26 utt4: are you a student  /
qrr          B.26 utt5: {C or } are you in the work force  /
%          B.26 utt6: {C or, } -/  

na          A.27 utt1:  {F Um, } I'm a senior at Clarion University. /  

bk          B.28 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  {C Because } one of the things that I've heard so much about [ l-, + {F um, } lately ] is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.  /
sd          B.28 utt3:  {C And } apparently [ many of the, + especially like in date rape, many of the, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, }     

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And } they don't really, -/  

+          A.31 utt1:  not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.  /
qy          A.31 utt2:  You know,    

ba          B.32 utt1:  Wow. /  

  +        A.33 utt1:  what I mean?  /
  sd        A.33 utt2: A lot of times --   

  ny        B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

  +        A.35 utt1:  -- the girls don't even report it. /  

 b         B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
 b^r         B.36 utt2: yeah. /  

sd         A.37 utt1:  {F Um, } I've heard of a few case up here,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C but } I can't say that I've heard of, {F uh, } {D you know, } any significant amount. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } then again {D like } you don't know how many girls are reporting them or  not. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.40 utt2:  They say like only one in ten are reported.  /
sv          B.40 utt3: I believe it. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ba          B.42 utt1:  That's awful.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  {C So } one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.  /
sd          B.42 utt3:  I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.  /
sv          B.42 utt4:  {C But } I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, {D you know, } for people to report it. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.44 utt1:  {C So } that's probably something else they could do. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          B.46 utt1:  I don't know,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs,   

x          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.48 utt1:  {D you know. }  /
%          B.48 utt2: {C And } that's like as long as, - /
sd          B.48 utt3: it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, {D you know, } - /
sv(^q)          B.48 utt4: {C because } these kids are <child_talking> saying why should I go to high school  /
 ^q         B.48 utt5: {C and so } I can go out and work at Burger King, {D you know, } for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.  /
sv          B.48 utt6: {C So } that's certainly a big problem.  /
sv          B.48 utt7:  I don't know what the solution to that is.  /
sv          B.48 utt8:  Having more drug treatment centers available.  /
h          B.48 utt9:  Jeez, I don't know. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  {F Uh. }  {D See, } you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  I know a lot of people <child> that partake in that.  /
sd          A.51 utt2: {C And } I'm not saying they're bad people,  /
sv          A.51 utt3: {C but } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would say that's a bigger problem. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.52 utt2:  {C Because } it ends up, - /
sv          B.52 utt3: even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, {D you know, }  /
sv          B.52 utt4: huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, {D you know, } on higher and higher up,   

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  on drugs,  /
sv          B.54 utt2: {C and } it's definitely got to do with crime.  /
sv          B.54 utt3: {D You know, } you hear about people selling their babies, {D you know, } to get some crack. /  

x          A.55 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          B.56 utt1:  {E I mean, } just, {F oh, } - /
sv          B.56 utt2: gosh, horrible stuff like that.  /
sd          B.56 utt3: One of the things they're doing [ is, + is ] they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  They said, {F uh, } some of the [ statis-, + statistics ] show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are <child> addicted to crack,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {C and } their moms are crack users.  /
sv          B.58 utt3:  {C So } that's, {D you know, } another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, {D you know, } for doing that to her child. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C So } I don't know who's the victim there.  /
sv          B.60 utt2:  {E I mean } the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.  /
sv          B.60 utt3: {C And, } it's a very complicated problem.  /
sd          B.60 utt4:  I don't envy the government trying to cope with it.  Gosh. /  

aa          A.61 utt1:  <Laughter>  No, I don't either. /
