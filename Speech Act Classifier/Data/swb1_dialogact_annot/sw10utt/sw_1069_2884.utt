sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } we don't actually have a [ budget, + budget ] per se.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:  What we do is, {F uh, } maintain a normal checkbook.  {D You know, } like,    

b          A.3 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  everyone in the world does, I guess,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C and } occasionally it actually balances, <laughter>.  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C And, } {F um, } [  [ we also, +   we, ] + {F um, } we ] have [ a, + a ] U S Air and Visa card. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1: [ [ Every, + every ] dollar we, + every dollar we ] charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.   /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C So } [ what we, + what ] my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:  Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C So } what we'll do is, -/  

qy^2          A.11 utt1:  {D Well, } then you just pay it off at the end of the month? /  

na          B.12 utt1:  Right.  /

b          A.13 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  {C And so } what we do is, [ we + ] anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C And then } at the end of the month all the money to  ((   ))  covered already.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C So } we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Oh.  /
ba          A.17 utt2:  That's a real good idea. /

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  {D See, } {D now } I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that.  /

sd          A.21 utt5: She likes to spend on anything and everything <laughter>.  With body lotion, everything <laughter>.  /
sd          A.21 utt6:  {C So, } [ we really haven't, + we don't  have ] a good organized system, yet.  /

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah  /
sd          B.36 utt2: <laughter>.  What we do is, we take money [ out of her, + out of her ] paycheck each week. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C And } [ put it, + it ] goes directly to another account, [ that we don't, + at an entirely different bank, that we don't ] have access to so easily,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C and } it goes there  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C and } it stays there  /

x          B.40 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.41 utt1:  Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.  /
sd          A.41 utt2:  It's going to be hard for her to, {F uh, } not have her own money.  Because, like now, {D you know, } I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years.  /
sd          A.41 utt3: {C And } now she wants to go back to school,  /

sd          A.43 utt3: I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through.  /
sd          A.43 utt4:  It doesn't work, Ken <laughter>. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Gee. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  My mother always said, "now, don't argue about money",  /
sd          A.45 utt2: {C so } we don't. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Right. /
