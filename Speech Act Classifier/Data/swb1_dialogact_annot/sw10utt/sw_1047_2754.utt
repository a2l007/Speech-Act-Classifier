o          @B.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          @B.2 utt2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } {D anyways, } I'm not exactly sure  /
sd^t          @B.2 utt3: [ I, + I ] wasn't really, {F uh, } paying attention as to what particular, {F uh, } parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about,  /
qo^t          @B.2 utt4: {C but } it was, {F uh, } basically what's your views on, whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used, that sort of thing? /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Right.  /
h          B.4 utt2:  {C And, } {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sv          B.4 utt3: [ I've, + I've ] always thought that any, {F uh, } crime [ that, + {F uh, } that, ] {F uh, } intentionally where someone goes out and  premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, {F uh, } doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, {D you know, } there's [ a, + a ] very steep penalty to, {F uh, } be paid --   

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- when that's done,  /
%          B.6 utt2: {C and, } {F uh. }  Yeah,  /
qo          B.6 utt3: how do you feel about it? /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {F Uh, } I believe in it, too <laughter>. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sv          A.9 utt5:  {D you know, } on the premeditated murders I feel [ if you're, + {D you know, } {E I mean, } if ] it's beyond a doubt that you did it, {D you know } --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- I would say go ahead and execute that person as well. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  {C But, } it's the cases, {D you know, } like sometimes you, {D you know, } you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.13 utt2: they really didn't do it.  /
qh         A.13 utt3:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ [ you, + you ] got, + you got ] that point well, [ h-, + ] {D you know, } [ what, + what ] if a mistake is made and you put someone, {D you know, } to death that really didn't do it. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.14 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  There's always that chance,  /
h          A.15 utt2: I don't know,  /
sv          A.15 utt3: {C but, } I would say that, {D you know, } for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, {D you know, } -/  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qy^d          A.17 utt1:  You know what I'm saying?  /

b          B.18 utt1:  Right.  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.21 utt1:  {C So, } {F uh, } I, -/  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, {D you know, } because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason, /  

b          A.23 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  # I # don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it. /

sv          A.25 utt5:  I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or  something like that, that [ anyone + --

nn^r          B.28 utt3:  No  /

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  I know Florida has it. /

sd          B.34 utt1:  they're always  ((   ))  in Florida.  /
sv          B.34 utt2:  Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, {F uh, } some of the,   

b          A.35 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.36 utt1:  # other # southern states. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a [ un-, + unemployment ] rate. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } -/  

sv          B.40 utt1:  Get that unemployment way up  /
sv          B.40 utt2: {C so } then people, {D you know } tend towards crime,  /
sv          B.40 utt3: {C and then } [ they + <breathing> they ] start stiffening the penalties. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.41 utt2:  {C But } it's funny that, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.41 utt3: {E I mean, } {D like, } {D you know, } {D like } I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania.  /
h          A.41 utt4:  I'm not even sure of that,  /
sd          A.41 utt5: {C but } for some reason I think that, {D you know, } it was something like that.  /
%          A.41 utt6:  {C And, } it surprised, - /
sd          A.41 utt7: {C and } even Florida, I know they have it,  /
sv          A.41 utt8: {C and } you don't really hear about it real often, how many people, -/  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {D Well, } in Florida seems like, {F uh, } two or three times a year.  /

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.43 utt2: {C but, } [ you, + you ] think that, - /
sv          A.43 utt3: {E I mean } if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,   

b          B.44 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.45 utt1:  # {D you # know, } compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  No,  /
ba          B.46 utt2: that's true.  /
sd          B.46 utt3:  Course they have a requirement [ that, + {F uh, } that ] every single appeal must be permitted. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sv         B.48 utt1:  {C So, } of course, [ the, + the ] attorneys,   

sv          A.49 utt1:  # Everyone would appeal. # /  

+@          B.50 utt1:  # take them through # the whole chain.    

ba          A.51 utt1:  That's true, too. /  

+@          B.52 utt1:  {D You know, } even if the case is open and closed,  /
sv          B.52 utt2: they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, {D you know. } /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.53 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  They almost always get thrown right back out again,  /
sv          B.54 utt2: {C but } they have to have every single appeal made open to them.  /
sv@          B.54 utt3: {C And, } {D you know, } it's sort of strange because [ it almost + <<pause>>, it almost ] seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because, {E I mean, } the guy knows that, whether it's, {D you know, }  [ a, +  a ] month or two, or six years, he's still going to get, {D you know, } the chair when it comes around <laughter>.    

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.56 utt1:  {D You know. } /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  Some of these guys are really, {F uh, } {D you know, } violent Son of Sam killers and  stuff like that, {D you know. } /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.59 utt2: uh-huh. /  

%          B.60 utt1:  {E I mean, } they, -/  

sv          A.61 utt1:  # {C And then } they get out.  # /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  # everyone knows they're [ going get, + # not going ] to get out. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Yeah,  /

b          B.64 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  # {C and } # they do it again, {D you know. } /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.67 utt1:  It's like a slap on the fingers for them. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.69 utt1: [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + [ e-, + ] [ e-, + ] I don't, ] - /
sv          A.69 utt2: I think that it should be, - /
sv          A.69 utt3: {E I mean } if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate [ someone, + ] a murder, then I think, {D you know, } that [ they should likewise, + ] {D you know, } someone should take their life also.  /
qy          A.69 utt4: [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ] [ [ are, + are ] you, + would you ] draw the line there with just the premeditated murder? /  

na          B.70 utt1:  I think so. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  {F Uh, } a lot of [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about.  /
sv          B.72 utt2: Although, {D you know, } stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole, -/  

b          A.73 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  # {E I # mean, } these guys are certainly not going to, {F uh, } be, - /
%          B.74 utt2: they can't, - /
sd          B.74 utt3: {E I mean } they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison.  /
sv          B.74 utt4:  I don't think the parole system is really helping that much <laughter>. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Yeah. /  

ad          B.76 utt1:  Reduce the violence in the prisons.  /

sv          B.92 utt3:  That's, {F uh, } sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are.  Because the more grass root [ country, + {F uh, } parts of the country ] tend [ to, + to ] support capital punishment, where the places that are, {D you know, } less in contact with crime --
