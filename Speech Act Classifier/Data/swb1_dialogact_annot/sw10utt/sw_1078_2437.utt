qy          A.1 utt1:  [ Are, + are ] you a T I-er? /  

nn          B.2 utt1:  No,  /
nn^r          B.2 utt2: no,  /
sd^e          B.2 utt3: I work there as a temporary. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

qy          B.4 utt1:  {C But, } are you at T I? /  

ny          A.5 utt1: {F Oh } yeah. /  

qy^d          B.6 utt1:  {C So } you have to do the random drug testing. /  

ny          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
ny          A.7 utt2: yeah,  /
ny^r          A.7 utt3: yeah.  /
sd          A.7 utt4:  In fact with  me, [ this is, + it's not ] much to talk about,  /
sd          A.7 utt5: I'm so much for it.  /
sd          A.7 utt6:  I don't really have much to comment about  it.  /
sv^t          A.7 utt7: There've been some interesting subject that  they've called about.  /
qw          A.7 utt8:  How many times have you called,  /
qrr          A.7 utt9: {C or } have you been participating in this? /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } about ten or eleven calls. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {F Oh, } you got ten,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {D well } --   

b          B.10 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- [ you, + you've ] passed me up.  /
sd          A.11 utt2:  This is about six times. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Oh.  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  It doesn't bother me.  /
sd          B.14 utt2: I don't feel like  it's really a violation of privacy or anything. /  

aa          A.15 utt1:  No,  /
sv          A.15 utt2: I think it's good.  /
sd          A.15 utt3: In fact, I don't know  what the statistics were,  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C but } I think that they were surprised to find it so low.  /
sd          A.15 utt5:  I think they were expecting to find, {F uh, } {D like } the national  average at T I.  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C And } I think it was tremendously down. /  

qy^g          B.16 utt1:  As far as the number of drug users, you mean? /  

ny          A.17 utt1:  Yeah -- /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd^e          A.19 utt1:  -- as far as the number of people they  actually found that were drug users.  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C But } I think that <<stumbles on words>>  when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  {C And } they said that a certain number of  people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.  /
sv          A.21 utt2:  {C And } I think that's what helps, {D you know, } that in the warning that you  have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs,  actually go  /
sv          A.21 utt3: {C and then } usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of  rehabilitation and everything. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.22 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.22 utt3: {C so } that's real beneficial  for the company and the employee. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C and } our numbers have been way down.  /
sd          A.23 utt3:   I don't know what they were. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  When I worked for the temporary agency as  a permanent person, - /
%          B.24 utt2: {C and so } we had, - /
sd          B.24 utt3: when we sent temporaries to T I,  we had to have their drug tested. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {C And } we did have a couple of cases  where [ we really, + ] the person said that they hadn't used anything,  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } their test  came back positive,  /
sd          B.26 utt3: {C and } normally we didn't retest them.  /
sd          B.26 utt4: {C But } there were a couple of  people that we really thought that they were telling the truth  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C and }  we retested them {D like } the next day,  /
sd          B.26 utt6: {C and } they came back negative --   

b          A.27 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

 +         B.28 utt1:  -- the second time.  /
 sv         B.28 utt2:  {C So } [ that, + that's ]  the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem. /  

%          A.29 utt1:  {F Oh, } you're, - /
sv          A.29 utt2: that's a good point,  /
sd          A.29 utt3:  {C but } at T I [ they, + before they ] had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago  September, something like  that, they told us that the agency that did it  was the one that did it for the government.  /
sd          A.29 utt4:  {C And, } of course, that's critical,  just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to  be, {D you know, } have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.  /
sd          A.29 utt5: They don't make mistakes.  /
sv          A.29 utt6:  That would be terribly embarrassing --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- for someone to really come back positive  /
sd          A.31 utt2:  {C and } they were not.  /
sd          A.31 utt3:  {C And } I haven't heard of any, - /
sd          A.31 utt4: {D now } I'm not in personnel or anything. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } they say that there, it's almost down  to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:   In other words, there's very few mistakes,  /
sd          A.33 utt3: {C and } that, of course, has got to be critical.  /
sv          A.33 utt4:  It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,  /
sv          A.33 utt5:  it's got to be with a very, very good agency.  /
sv          A.33 utt6: You don't just have some local group do it.   /
sv          A.33 utt7:  It's got to be a highly qualified agency. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Right,  /
b          B.34 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: not just some doctor's office somewhere. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  No,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: you don't want to do that.  /
sv          A.35 utt3:   It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.  /
sd          A.35 utt4:  {C And } I think  that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.   /
sv          A.35 utt5: {C And } that would be good  for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.  /
 sv         A.35 utt6:   It's got to be with a, {D you know, } first class,  totally independent agency.  Not local of course.  /
sv          A.35 utt7:  Ours, [ I think, + {D well } I think ]  it was in the south somewhere,  /
sd          A.35 utt8: {C but } it wasn't even in Dallas, {D you know, } the one that did us. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh } really. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qy          B.38 utt1:  {F Huh. }    Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,  /
qrr          B.38 utt2: {C or } do they fire them right away. /  

nn          A.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } no.  /
sd^e          A.39 utt2: They're not fired.  /
sd          A.39 utt3:  [ They are, + they have ]  one chance to then go in a program.  /
sd          A.39 utt4: You come back positive, you have one chance to go  in, and go into, they have a lot of, {F uh, } rehabilitation,  both for alcohol and for drug use,  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } [ they have, {F uh, } a lot of, + {F uh, } they have an ]  agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  {C And so } [ [ they, + they, ] + they ]  don't,  /
nn          A.41 utt2: no,  /
sd^e          A.41 utt3: it's not firing first.  /
sd          A.41 utt4:  It's, {F uh, } definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate.  /
sd          A.41 utt5:   In fact, again, before you go, {D you know, } that's why I said,  when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if  you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and  get rehabilitated first,  /
sd          A.41 utt6: {C and } they won't say anything about it. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  I think that's really good. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  {F Oh } sure. /  

sd         B.44 utt1:  I know some places just fire people on  the spot if they come back positive or something. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah,  /
aa          A.45 utt2: no,  /
sv          A.45 utt3: that's not right.  /
sv          A.45 utt4:  It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is.  /
sv          A.45 utt5: {D You know, } it's a weakness and all,  /
sv          A.45 utt6:  {C and } [ who, + ] all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another.  /
sv          A.45 utt7:   {C And } I think that those people that have that and however they got into it, - /
sd          A.45 utt8:   I have children,  /
sd          A.45 utt9: I always worry about [ the, + the ] classical thing that you see on T V,  where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, {D you know, } and get them sucked in,  /
sd          A.45 utt10:  {C and then } they sell it to them.  /
sd          A.45 utt11: You know --   

b          B.46 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  -- the classical thing is to give it away.  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C and } they slip it to them.  /
h          A.47 utt4:  I don't know,  /
sd          A.47 utt5: I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether  that would get them addicted or  not, {D you know. }  /
sd          A.47 utt6:  That's a real worry. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: some of the stories you read about cocaine,  that's like people try it one time and they're addicted.  /
sd          B.48 utt3:  My husband is a counselor,  /
sd          B.48 utt4: {C and } he works, mostly with adolescents. /  

qy^d          A.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } you know a lot about that. /  

ny          B.50 utt1:  {C So } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.50 utt2: I hear a lot of horror stories  about things like that. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.52 utt1:  {C But } most of the time it's they get  into the wrong crowd first, <clicking>  /
sd          B.52 utt2: {C and then } they start a drug problem. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.55 utt2: I know,  /
sd          A.55 utt3: I'm glad of that.  /
sd          A.55 utt4:   {C And } I have, {A knock wood, } pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters <clicks on telephone> so far,  /
sd^c          A.55 utt5: that's my conference call,  /
sd          A.55 utt6: I have one daughter still at home.  /
sd          A.55 utt7:   One's at U T  /
sd          A.55 utt8: {C and } one's at home, gets dozen calls a night. /  

ad          B.56 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D well } I'll let you go if you want  to go ahead and take that, /  

ar          A.57 utt1:  No,  /
ar^r          A.57 utt2: no,  /
sd          A.57 utt3: I don't care about that,  /
sd          A.57 utt4:  she'll be on the phone all night. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
sv          B.58 utt2: it seems if you watch what  kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are --   

b          A.59 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  -- that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather. /  

qy          A.61 utt1:  Do you have children? /  

nn          B.62 utt1:  No  /
sd^e          B.62 utt2: not yet,  /
sd          B.62 utt3: we're expecting a baby --   

ba          A.63 utt1:  {F Oh, } great, /  

+          B.64 utt1:  -- in July,  /
sd          B.64 utt2: {C so } we're starting. /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  Fantastic experience.  /
sd          A.65 utt2:  I've got two,  as I said, I've at U T now in <clicking> Austin, and one at home,  /
sd          A.65 utt3: {C and } I always say  that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.67 utt1:  It's a fantastic experience. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {F Oh, } we're really excited about it. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  {D You know, } <clicking> one thing my husband  believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems,  he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, {D like } on a  Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.72 utt1:  If you're not too sure what's going on,  he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked. /  

sv          A.73 utt1:  The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here.  /
sv          A.73 utt2:  Have our house as a place where they can  come at any time, so that you always see their friends --   

b          B.74 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.75 utt1:  -- rather than make them not welcome  /
sv          A.75 utt2: {C and } they're always  over in someone else's house.  /
sd          A.75 utt3: {C So } [ our, + we've ] been lucky that  our house is usually the place where the kids could come, {D you know. } /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          B.76 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.76 utt3: I think that's a really good thing to encourage. /  

sv          A.77 utt1:  {C And then } [ you <clicking> can keep an eye, + you can make ]  judgments and make comments or whatever you want.  /
sv          A.77 utt2:  {C But } at least you see  what's going on,  /
sv          A.77 utt3: {C and } you always have your house welcome,  then your children think that, {D you know, } you're cool parents and all that. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

fo          A.79 utt1:  {D Well } good luck with your expected baby there. /  

ft          B.80 utt1:  {F Oh } {D well, } thanks. /  

sd          A.81 utt1:  My wife [ was yelling, + was talking ] in my ear,  /
sd          A.81 utt2:  she [ said, + reminded me to say ] that they're very cheap until they get to start driving. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.83 utt1:  {C And } we have one, of course,  I say, in college driving.  And one going to drive this summer,  /
sd          A.83 utt2: {C so } kids [ are, + ]  cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything.  /
sd          A.83 utt3:  {C But } you wait until they go and get a car, <clicking> insurance,  that's when they get expensive.  /
sd          A.83 utt4: As they get older --   

b          B.84 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.85 utt1:  -- {D you know, } they cost practically  nothing from one to five,  /
