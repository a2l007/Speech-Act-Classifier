b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.43 utt1:  {C And } I think he kind of misses it a little bit, {D you know, } since we moved to the city.  /
 sd         A.43 utt2: {C But, } {F um, } I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than his <laughter>. /

ba          B.68 utt1:  {F Oh, } my gosh.  /

sd          A.69 utt1:  {C So } what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied.  /

sd          A.87 utt3: the people that [ bought ours, + bought the place,  ] [ but, + ] {F um, } I knew that they would, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.87 utt4: if I left {D like } one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them. /  

 b         B.88 utt1:  Yeah. /  

 sd         A.89 utt1:  {C So, } it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something,  {D you know, }  /
 sd         A.89 utt2: it would cover it right up. /  

b          B.90 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.91 utt1:  {C But, } I just couldn't see it, {D you know, } going off and leaving everything like that. /  

 b         B.92 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.93 utt1:  {C Because } this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired.  /

sd         A.97 utt1:  {E I mean, } {C and } it is ugly. /  

x          B.98 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.99 utt1:  I even tried making it look nicer, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.99 utt2: I tied the yellow ribbon around it,  /
sd        A.99 utt3: {C and } it was so ugly. /  

x          B.100 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd            A.101 utt1:  {F Oh, } it did not help, let me tell you.  /
sd          A.101 utt2: I took it off and put it on my door.  /
sd          A.101 utt3: I did not want to call attention.  /
sd           A.101 utt4: <Laughter> {E I mean, } it was terrible.  /
 sd         A.101 utt5: {C So } really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all.  /
sd          A.101 utt6:  I don't do any of the mowing or, {D you know, } edging and all that -- /  

b          B.102 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.103 utt1:  -- My husband does all that stuff.  /
sd          A.103 utt2:  {C But } that's because I'm allergic to the grass. /  

ba          B.104 utt1:  {F Oh, } that'd be awful.  /
sd          B.104 utt2: I love going out in the Summer in the grass. /  

b          A.105 utt1:  Really. /  

ny          B.106 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd         A.107 utt2: {C because } then it doesn't make me ill <laughter>. /  

b          B.108 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.108 utt2:  {C And, } {F um, } {D well } even up here at school, {D you know, } it gets hot, and we have the windows open,  /
sd          B.108 utt3: {D well } they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning.  /
sd          B.108 utt4: {C And } just to smell the grass, it's just, - /
sd          B.108 utt5: I just love the smell of freshly cut grass. /  

b          A.109 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          A.109 utt3: I don't know if it's all, {D well, } - /
sd          A.109 utt4: I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to.  /
sd          A.109 utt5:  {C But } it's not as bad here,  /
sd          A.109 utt6: {D like } Saint Augustine, I think, is what we have.  /
