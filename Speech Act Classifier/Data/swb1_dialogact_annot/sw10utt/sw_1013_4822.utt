   o        A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
   ad       A.1 utt2: Go ahead. /  

 sd       @B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas  [ in the, + {F uh, } in the  ] space station program  /
 sd        @B.2 utt2: {C so } --    

 b         A.3 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there  /
sv          B.4 utt2: # {C and } # --   

 b         A.5 utt1:  # Sure. # /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels. /  

 b         A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sv         B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ they're, + they're  ] going to be doing a lot of interesting things.  /
sv         B.8 utt2: {F Uh, } I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads.  /
sv          B.8 utt3:  {C And } that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including, {F uh, } some new pharmaceutical techniques. /  

ba          A.9 utt1:  {F Oh, } you're kidding.  /
b          A.9 utt2:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C So, } {D you know, } # [ there's # -- +   

%          A.11 utt1:  # {F Huh. } # /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- there's  ] a big opportunity for us to explore, {F uh, } what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
b          A.13 utt2:  # Sure. # /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  # {C So. } #  I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's good because sometimes I wonder, {D you know, } being a, {F uh, } lay person out there [ of + ] not, {F uh, } knowing [ e-, + exactly  ] what's going on in space. Whether, {D you know, } they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not  /
sd          A.15 utt2: we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here.  /
%          A.15 utt3:  Being, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.15 utt4:  to me, all this, {F uh, } space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth.    That, {F uh,  }  we can't live on Mars.  /
sv          A.15 utt5:  We can't live here,  /
sv          A.15 utt6: we can't live there.  /
 sv         A.15 utt7:  {E I mean, } this is [ the, + the  ] place that we have to live.  /
sv          A.15 utt8: {E I mean, } there's, {F uh, } no other resource for us [ to, + to  ] look at other than here.  /
%          A.15 utt9:  {C So, }  it's kind of like, to me, - /
sv         A.15 utt10:  I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space  /
%          A.15 utt11: {C and } what, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.15 utt12:  not that I want everything to halt  /
sd          A.15 utt13: {C and } let's forget about the space program or whatever,  /
sv          A.15 utt14: {C because } we're always curious  /
sv          A.15 utt15: {C and }  we always need to know more things.  /
sv          A.15 utt16:  {C But, } {F uh, } to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here.  /
sv        A.15 utt17: Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here.  /
 %         A.15 utt18: Mainly because, {F uh, } - /
 sv         A.15 utt19: the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us.  /
 sv         A.15 utt20:  {E I mean } this is it.  /
 sv         A.15 utt21:  {E I mean }  [ if we would have, + {F uh, } if we would have ] went into space and found Mars a livable, {F uh, } planet, we probably would have <noise> inhabited it  /
  qh        A.15 utt22:  {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } who would have cared about earth?  /
  sv        A.15 utt23: It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, {F uh, } continue on.  /
  %        A.15 utt24:  [ {C So, } + {D you know, } {C and }  ] that - /
 sd         A.15 utt25: when I look at the space program itself, I think of it, {D you know, } as being in terms of [ it's, + it's  ] interesting to learn but [ [ it's also, + it's,  ] + it  ] brings down the fact that this earth is it.  /
 sv         A.15 utt26: It's it for us,  {A you know what I mean? }    

  b        B.16 utt1:  Right. /  

  +        A.17 utt1:  {F Uh, } unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever.  /
sd          A.17 utt2: {C But } I would love to, {F uh, } go into the space shuttle some day and, {F uh, } just see, {F uh, } {D you know, } the earth and the different planets and  things like that.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  [ I, + I  ] think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } <swallowing> as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- between, {D you know, } [ deep space + <<mispronounced>>, {E I'm sorry, } deep space + ] exploration --   

 b         A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- [ and, + {F uh, } and  ] not doing anything --    

b          A.23 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.24 utt1:  -- because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Exactly.  /
b          A.25 utt2: Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that, {F uh, } we'd normally do down here --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- that are damaging to the environment. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  Exactly.  /
b          A.29 utt2: Yeah,  /
ba          A.29 utt3: that's true, {D you know. }  /
%          A.29 utt4: {C And } [ I, + I  ] think of, {F uh, } - /
qy^d          A.29 utt5: I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert. /  

 ny         B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.31 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ there's, + {F uh, } {D you know, } they're  ] trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create, {D you know, } an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it   /
 sd         A.31 utt2: {C and  then } they have an area that's more, {F uh, } {D you know, } full of, {F uh, } vegetation, tropicals, that kind of thing, to kind of look at things and say, {D you know, } [ the + ] environment wise, this is where we're living  /
%          A.31 utt3:  {C but } [ what, + what  ] effects it  /
sd          A.31 utt4: {C and }  how can we improve it and things like that.  /
%          A.31 utt5: {C And } [ I, + I  ] think in space, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.31 utt6: I don't know how many people could live up in space, {F uh, } for any length of time <laughter>.  /
sd          A.31 utt7:  {E I mean } just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out - /
sd          A.31 utt8: {C and } it's cloudy for days  /
sd          A.31 utt9: {C and } we don't see the sun  /
sv          A.31 utt10: {C and } the people, their moods are extreme, # {D you know. } # /  

b          B.32 utt1:  # Right. # /  

sv(^q)          A.33 utt1:  It's like, God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time  /
sd         A.33 utt2: {C and } this is how I see people reacting.  /
qh          A.33 utt3: {D You know, } when is the sun going to come out?  /
sd          A.33 utt4: {C So } I wonder how, {D you know, } somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun <laughter>. {D You know, } in the aspect that we see it.    

b          B.34 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  {F Uh, } and never seeing, {F uh, } {D you know, } light, bright days, {D you know. }  /
%          A.35 utt2: {C And, } -/
