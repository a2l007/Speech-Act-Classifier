o          A.1 utt1:  Yes,  /
qw          A.1 utt2: [ what, + what  ] major changes have affected your life? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that, {F uh, } [ women, + women  ] working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now.  /
%          B.2 utt2: {F Um, } /  

qr          A.3 utt1:  You mean yourself, or women in general? /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {D Well, } women in general, [ and, + and  ] also myself. /  

 b         A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C But, } {F um, } it used to not really make a difference to me, {F um, }  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C or } at least I didn't think so.  /
sd          B.6 utt3: {C But } my mother worked,  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C and } I kind of now wish [ that, + that  ] she hadn't.     

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.8 utt1:  [ That, + {F um, } that  ] she had, {F um, } stayed home,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: {C and } right now I'm kind of stuck because I'd like to have children,  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but } I'm not ready to do that because when I do have children I want to stay home.  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C So } I'm having to, {F uh, } try to figure out a way to be able to do that. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C And, } [ in, + in  ] our society right now that's really something [ that's, + that's,  ] {F um, } not respected,  /
sv          B.10 utt2: {C and } [ [ it's not, + it's not, ] + {F um, } it's not  ] easy to do --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- at all.  /
sv          B.12 utt2:  {E I mean, } there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family [ if the, + if the  ] wife is going to actually be a mother. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          A.13 utt2: uh-huh.  /
sv          A.13 utt3:  That's interesting,  /
sd          A.13 utt4: {C because } that relates to the thing [ that, + that  ] strikes me the most,  /
sv          A.13 utt5: {C and } I'm sure [ you've, + you've  ] labelled the cause, because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave.  /
%          A.13 utt6: {C And, } -/  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sv          B.14 utt2:  I think [ that + that  ]  ((   ))  they have to be related. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  That's right,  /
 ba^r         A.15 utt2: that's right.  /
sd          A.15 utt3:  {C And } {D you know, } {E I mean } I was thinking it just, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.15 utt4: my complaint [ would, + would  ] be, {F um, } that I think that, {D you know, } the kids in the neighborhood run wild,  /
sv          A.15 utt5: {C and } [ they, + they  ] destroy property,  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C and } they, {D you know, } steal each other's toys and stuff  /
sv          A.15 utt7: {C and } --   

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.17 utt1:  -- there's just no respect [ for, + for  ] people or property,  /
sv          A.17 utt2: {C and } I guess,  {D you know, } when you stop to think of it, these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
ba          B.18 utt2: I think that that's probably true. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  Scary, /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  I just wish there was a way,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: I know that [ [ in, + in,  ] + {D you know, } in  ] Sweden, what they have there, it's really their medical plan, but it also deals with this subject,  because if a woman, {F uh, } is working --   

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh /  

+          B.22 utt1:  -- and I think even if she's not, and has a child, the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child. /  

qw          A.23 utt1:  {C But } for how many years? /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  [ I don't, + I don't  ] know. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.26 utt1:  Until it, {F um, } - /
sv          B.26 utt2: I'm sure until at least school age, and maybe longer. /  

ba          A.27 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  What this does is, it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care --   

 b         A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 +         B.30 utt1:  -- to raise the child for her. /  

 b         A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

 sv         B.32 utt1:  {C And } I think that that's [ a real, + a  ] much, much more viable solution, {D really. } /  

 b         A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
 aa         A.33 utt2:  No,  /
aa          A.33 utt3: I agree, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.   /
sd          A.33 utt4:  I guess I was lucky, because I was teaching,   /
sd          A.33 utt5: {C and so } I was able to just go to a class and  teach when my son was little,  /
sd          A.33 utt6: {C and so } I'd be gone, {D you know, } an hour and  fifteen minutes or something at a stretch. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah,  /
ba          B.34 utt2: that's great. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  {C And, then, } yeah,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C and } --   

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- {D you know, } nobody seemed to have a big problem with that <laughter>.  /
sv          A.37 utt2:  {C So. } That's an interesting issue though.  /
%          A.37 utt3: {F Um, } yeah  /
x          A.37 utt4: <laughter>.   

^h          B.38 utt1:  {F Um, } goodness,  /
qw^t          B.38 utt2: what else? /  

x          A.39 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } there's been so many,  /
qw          B.40 utt2: how do you just, -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Right,  /
%          A.41 utt2: I've, - /
sd          A.41 utt3: {D actually } [ another one that I, + a question I  ] would have is, - /
sd          A.41 utt4: I guess I'm being, {D you know, } beyond the age of thinking of [ this, + this  ] problem.  /
sd          A.41 utt5: I had an argument recently with my boss,  /
sd          A.41 utt6: I think it was, about the need for women to work.   /
sv          A.41 utt7: {C But } I think you put your finger on it, when you said that they're not respected if they don't work,  because it seems to me that a lot of people I know, women I know, are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense, certainly financially -- /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  -- {C and, } {E I mean, } when I see the amount of clothes that they buy [ and, + and  ] how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home --   

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          B.44 utt2: uh-huh. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- I'm sure that they're not [ making + quote making  ] money for the family on this -- /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          B.46 utt2: really. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] probably you're right. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  I don't see how they could be, especially not if they have to pay for child care. /  

ar          A.49 utt1:  {D Well, } no,  /
sd          A.49 utt2: even families that don't have child care, - /
sd          A.49 utt3: {E I mean, } {D you know, } when I think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year, [ and + ] I'm sure she spends at least that in clothes, plus, {D you know, } fast food every day, and out to lunch every day, /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.51 utt1:  {C and, } -/  

sv          B.52 utt1:  You're probably right.  /
sv          B.52 utt2:  If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like,  God, what am I doing this for, {D you know. } /  

aa          A.53 utt1:  Exactly,  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C and } {E I mean, } {D you know, } even though they don't have children,  [ they, + they  ] have relatives  /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } the husband would certainly like a lot more attention,  /
sd          A.53 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house, and  do the gardening <laughter>.  /
sv          A.53 utt5: {C And, so, } [ I, + I  ] guess you're right.  /
%          A.53 utt6: [ It's, + it's  ] - /
sv          A.53 utt7:  our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  Really sad <laughter>. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt2: religion has changed, too. /  

ba          A.57 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's true. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {F Um, } {F uh, } some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for, instead of just, {F um, } - /
%          B.58 utt2: [ [ it, + it's, ] + it, ] - /
sv          B.58 utt3:  some places still it seems like it's a social club. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.60 utt1:  {D You know, } it's just a place to go, to visit, {F uh, } to wear your nice clothes, [ and, + and  ] to sit around and talk,  /
sv          B.60 utt2: {C but, } {F um, } I think a lot of people are really, {D you know, } searching now to [ find, + find  ] out who they are, and who God is, and  what all that really means now. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sv          A.61 utt2: {C so } that might be a positive change in society. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.62 utt2: {F oh, } [ [ it's, + it's,  ] + {F um, } it's  ] beginning, I think. /

b^r          A.63 utt2: uh-huh.  /
sd          A.63 utt3:  I guess I haven't seen that as much in this area, although every now and then you hear about it. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } among, {D you know, } people I know, I don't see a great, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.65 utt2:  there are those people who [ have, + have  ] had serious questions all along, and,  {D you know, } are sort of pursuing it -- /  

 b         B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.67 utt1:  -- {C but, } {F um, } the churches here are growing, leaps and bounds,  /
sv          A.67 utt2: {C and } I thought it was more because of [ the, + the  ] very transient nature of the area --   

b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.69 utt1:  -- and that people were going basically just as you said, as a social to meet people, and that,  /
sv          A.69 utt2: {C but, } {F um, } it's hard to judge,  /
sv          A.69 utt3: {C and } there are a lot of things changing, I suppose, /  

b          B.70 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.71 utt1:  Just, {D you know, } [ the whole, + the whole  ] environment, I find --

b          B.74 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes.  /
sv          B.74 utt2: {D Well, } I guess that's always happened. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Probably. /  

sv          B.76 utt1:  Maybe not as much as now  /
