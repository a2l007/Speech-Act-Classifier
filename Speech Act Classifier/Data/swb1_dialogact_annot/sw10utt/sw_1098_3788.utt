sd         A.1 utt1:  {C And } I have to admit that we just moved  to Plano recently and that I hadn't voted in an election yet,  /
sd         A.1 utt2: {C and } although I did go down and  register and I, - /
sd          A.1 utt3:  that's the first time I've ever done that.  /
qo          A.1 utt4:  [ Has, + what's ]  been your voting experience? /  

br^m          B.2 utt1:  My voting experience? /  

qy          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter> {D Well, } do you feel like, {F uh, } - /
%          A.3 utt2: {E I mean, }  I, -/  

sd          B.4 utt1:  [ [ I, + I, ] {D well, } + personally I've ]  been very diligent --   

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- until recent years.    

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+         B.8 utt1:  When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  For the issues  [ that, + {D you know, } <child_yelling> that ] I felt really strong for, {F uh, } I think apathy has set in to a lot of # people # --   

b          A.11 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- because of <child_yelling> the way  our politicians are and the way our country is being run. /  

aa          A.13 utt1:  That's really true.  /
sv          A.13 utt2:   That's kind of the way I have felt.  /
sd          A.13 utt3:  [ I, + I ] also feel guilty, {F uh, } not knowing and not going the extra mile  myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates.  /
sv          A.13 utt4:  Course,  we only have mostly the representation given in the media,  /
sd          A.13 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, }  I have felt since I've been here that I haven't known what the issues were   [ and that  I, + ]  because it was a new community. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  You really do have to study to get  yourself, {F uh, } up to par with what is truly going on -- /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv        B.16 utt1:  -- {C and } that takes a lot of  research  /

sd          B.20 utt2: I know I'm heavily involved in other things -- /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         B.22 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ]  to take time out and, {F uh, } study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time -- /

sv          B.28 utt1:  {C And } unfortunately they are not. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  No. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } it's really a dilemma, {F uh, }  that we find ourselves in, I believe.  {F Uh, } /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.32 utt1: <Child_yelling> {C So } I kind of just have  taken a back step away and, {F uh, } hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.34 utt1:  Take it, - /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C because } it is a task that  is, to me, kind of overwhelming. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ]  {F uh, } I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, {F uh, } since we're [ s-, + ]  back on the old system of electoral votes [ [ and, + or that, ] + and that ]  [ you don't necessarily, + your vote doesn't ] necessarily elect president. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          B.36 utt2: they just want to see how close  the electoral votes <laughter> are with the public votes. /

sv          A.39 utt2: it's awful,  /
sv         A.39 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ]  it's hard to feel like one person,  /
sv         A.39 utt4: {C but } I know that it's important,  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } I feel guilty that  I haven't done that here, haven't taken the time  /
sv          A.39 utt6: {C and } I know that, {D you know, }  people can make a difference,  /
sv          A.39 utt7: {C but } it's hard [ to, + to ]  face the corruption, like you say, [ and, + {F uh, } and ] to know what you're up against.  /
sd          A.39 utt8:  {C And } it makes me  feel bad that, - /

sd          A.43 utt3: {C but } I haven't done  that so far. /  

sv         B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } I know that when you're in a  smaller community, - /

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd         B.48 utt2: {E I mean, }  [ they, + they ] just give it a small portion of the newspaper,  /
sd         B.48 utt3: {C but } the local  newspaper really goes into, {F uh, } quite a bit of history about the candidate -- /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and then } ] [ [ they have, + they raise a, ] + they raise ]  two sides  /
