b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  was that her mother was very old,   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {F Uh, } it seems like they must be waiting  until it is a necessity -- /

ba          A.53 utt1:  That is true.  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {C But } what I mean is instead of  maybe entering a nursing home,

+          B.62 utt1:  That is right.  /
sv          B.62 utt2: {D Well, } that is because  they wait until the children make those choices,   

b          A.63 utt1:  Right. /
