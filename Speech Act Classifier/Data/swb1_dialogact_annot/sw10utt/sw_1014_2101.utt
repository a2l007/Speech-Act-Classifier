+          B.66 utt1:  than, {D you know, } other kinds of things. /  

 sd         A.67 utt1:  {D Well, } that's probably what I watch most frequently besides {D like } news programs is the movies  /
sd          A.67 utt2: {C and } they have a couple of channels that are {D like } nostalgic older movies,    

b          B.68 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          A.69 utt1:  that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time <laughter>.    

b          B.70 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.71 utt1:  Like the MARX BROTHERS <static> and things like that. /

sd          A.75 utt4: Some of the video rentals can be expensive  /
%          A.75 utt5: {C and, } -/  

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah.  /
^2          B.76 utt2: {C And, } boy,  /
^2          B.76 utt3: the movie can be unbelievable. /  

  b        A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
 b         A.77 utt2: right.  /
 sd         A.77 utt3: Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.  /
  %        A.77 utt4: {C So } we, - /
  %       A.77 utt5: I have, - /
sd          A.77 utt6: {C and } it's so convenient at home  /

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  [ {C And } + {C so, }  ] I have really enjoyed that  /
 %         A.79 utt2:  [ {C but, } + {C but }  ] there are, - /
sd          A.79 utt3: I do have friends that watch programs  /
 sd         A.79 utt4: {D like } they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.  /

b          B.80 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sd          B.80 utt2: I'm not that hung up to most things. /

b          A.83 utt1:  Yes.  /
sv          A.83 utt2: {D Well, } {C and } things are repeated,    

b          B.84 utt1:  Yeah.  /
ba          B.84 utt2:  That's true. /  

+          A.85 utt1:  so often that {D you know } [ if, + if  ] I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show <laughter>.   

 b        B.86 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.87 utt1:  if I ever decide to tune it in again, /

b          A.95 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
