sv          A.17 utt3: {C But } I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, {F uh, } there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S --   

b          B.18 utt1:   Sure. /

sv          A.19 utt4: [ [  I, + I, ] + I ] have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them [ it would totally elat-, + {D you know, } it would totally ] destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time. /
