qw          A.1 utt1:  {C So, } what do you think of our trial system? <noise>. /  

h         B.2 utt1:  {F Huh, } I don't really know what to think about it,  /
%          B.2 utt2: {C but } I do know that they're not, {D you know, } - /
sv          B.2 utt3: they'll give somebody twenty-five years and they'll serve what, eight months. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qy          B.4 utt1:  Have you noticed that? /

sv^e          A.5 utt2: I have noticed [ that, + that, ] that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit, {F um, }  /

sv          B.8 utt1:  {C But } I think trial by jury [ is, + it's  ] a lot better than leaving it up to one person. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.9 utt2: I think trial by jury is very good.  /

 o@         B.10 utt1:   ((   )) .   

 sv^t         A.11 utt1:  {C or } leaving sentencing up to the judge only. - /
sv          A.11 utt2: I think that's actually good idea. /  

qy^d          B.12 utt1:  Leaving it up to the judge? /  

na          A.13 utt1:  {D We-, } [ just, + just  ] sentencing, not the trial itself. /  

bk          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  {F Um, } {C because } I think [ [ [ that + th-, ] + that,  ] + that  ] judges are probably more informed as to [ what is, + ]   

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah, /  

+          A.17 utt1:  how serious the nature of the crime is,   

b          B.18 utt1:  {D well } right  /
 sv         B.18 utt2: {C because, }

+          B.20 utt1:  the general public doesn't know that [ [ if, + i-,  ] + if  ] they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life. /  

b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  Course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that.  /
b          B.22 utt2: {C So } yeah, /  

 b         A.23 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          A.23 utt2: {C so } he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence, in some cases there. /

sv          B.30 utt3: [ pe-, + too many people  ] can take vendettas out on people,    

b          A.31 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.32 utt1:  and everything. /  

%          A.33 utt1:  Or just, {D you know, } - /

%          A.35 utt2: Someone says to you, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.35 utt3: when they ask you [ if you, + {F uh, } if you  ] want to be on, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.35 utt4: when you're called for duty say oh yeah,  I want to be on jury duty because I can spot a guilty person a mile a way. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  They quickly let you off jury duty I hear, {F um. } /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Right  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {C because } [ they, + they  ] know that you're biased. /

sv          A.39 utt2: [ [ [ [ that, + that, ] + that, ] + that, ] + [ that's, +  that's  ] ] the way it works there, {F um. }  /
%          A.39 utt3:  Anyway, I think that probably [ for, + for  ] having it, - /
qh          A.39 utt4: what  [ about, + {D you know, } about  ] being unanimous.  /
sv          A.39 utt5: {E I mean, } that's sort of a strange case because I wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't,  /
sd          A.39 utt6: one person thinks [ that, + that  ] they're not guilty  /
sv          A.39 utt7: {C and } they can't decide for hours, unless they convince that one person, {D you know. } /  

qy          B.40 utt1:  Does it have to be unanimous? /  

na          A.41 utt1:  I believe it does have to be unanimous, actually. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {D Well } then they consider it a hung jury, [ I g-, + I think  ]  /
sv          B.42 utt2: {C and then } they, {F uh, } have a retrial,  /
qy          B.42 utt3: or do they. /  

ny          A.43 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^e          A.43 utt2: I think they either have a retrial eventually [  or, +  or  ] they call it a mistrial or something. /

sd          A.45 utt1:  I haven't been to law school. /

sd         A.49 utt1:  I just know that, {F um. } - /
%         A.49 utt2: I wonder  /
sd          A.49 utt3: {C 'cause } sometimes I think about it actually,  /
sd          A.49 utt4: I think {D well, } what if I were that one person and I was completely convinced [ [ [ that, + that,  ] + that,  ] + that  ] this person wasn't guilty, {D you know. } /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {D Well } you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty,  /

%          B.50 utt3: {C because } <clicking>, -/  

b          A.51 utt1: Right, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.51 utt2: {C but, } {E I mean } what if eleven other people are saying one thing, {D you know, } and [ you're, +

+          A.53 utt1:  you're  ] the one person saying the other thing.  /

sd@         B.54 utt1:  <Child_crying> <child_talking> I would hate to be that person because you would be, {F uh, } {D you know, } bombarded by all the other eleven jurors --

sv          A.59 utt2: [ I, + I  ] guess if they were to say, {D well } it doesn't have to be unanimous,  /
sv          A.59 utt3: what's the cut off number, seven, five, {D you know, } six, six, /
