sd          A.9 utt4: {C but } we used to go to Tyler State Park and, {F uh, } Daingerfield  /
sd          A.9 utt5: {C and } in Texas that is where we camp basically.  {F Uh, } /  

qo          B.10 utt1:  What are they like? /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  They are very nice.  /
sd          A.11 utt2: Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.  /
sd          A.11 utt3: It has a nice little lake  /
sd         A.11 utt4: {C and } it has some really wonderful, {F uh, } sights that are in the wooded areas.  /
sd          A.11 utt5:  {F Uh, } the facilities are quite nice  /
sd          A.11 utt6: {C and } our children  [ liked, + liked  ] it quite well.  /
sd@          A.11 utt7: {F Uh, } [ the kids are, + {D well } they are  ] quite a bit younger than, - / *[[should be 'then']]
%          A.11 utt8: {C and } {D you know } they, - /
sd          A.11 utt9: we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.  /
sd          A.11 utt10: {C And, } {F uh, } [ it was just, + it was just  ] a really nice place to camp. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.13 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D now } Daingerfield is, - /
^h          A.13 utt2: let's see,  /
sv          A.13 utt3: I think that's a little bit   [ [ mor-, + more ] east, + further east,  ]  [ and + and ] maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.  /
ar          A.13 utt4: No,  /
sv          A.13 utt5: I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.  /
sd          A.13 utt6: At any rate [ it was, + it was ] very nice as well.  /
sd         A.13 utt7:  {C But } Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think. /  

 b         B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

 sd         A.15 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, {F uh, } had done a lot of camping in Michigan,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially, - /
sd          A.15 utt3: {C and then } also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C so, } {F uh, } my parents were real avid campers  ((   ))  /
sd          A.15 utt5: {C and } my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C So } I guess we just kind of came by it naturally <laughter>. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qy          A.17 utt1:  Do you have a large tent  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qw          A.21 utt1:  {C And } how many does it sleep, {F uh, } comfortably? /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } there, {D well } supposedly, - /
sv          B.22 utt2: they always say it sleeps more than it does. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {C But } [ th-, + they,  ] - /

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, {F uh, }  we invested in some stacking, {F uh, } cots, {D you know, } that were like  [ bunk, +  bunk ] beds,  /
sd          A.27 utt2: {C but } they were [ cots, + fold up cots. ]  /
sd          A.27 utt3:  That really gave us a lot more [ space, + {F um, } floor space  ] {C and, <sigh> so, } you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around  /
%          A.27 utt4: {C and, } -/  

b          B.28 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {F uh, } gave us a place to stack things during the day  /

%          A.29 utt3: {C But, } {F uh, } we, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.29 utt4: {D like, } my in-laws also had a camper,  or, {F uh, } a pop up tent,  {D you know, } one of those trailer tops  /
sd          A.29 utt5: {C and } those are really nice too.  /
sd          A.29 utt6: A little more, {F uh, } luxurious, so to speak, <laughter>  but not much <laughter>. /

sd          A.31 utt5:  It was quite nice in that respect.  /
sd          A.31 utt6: <sigh> {F Uh, } {C and } everything was very convenient  /
sd          A.31 utt7: {C and } you did not have [ to, + to  ] be hauling things out of [ your, +  the trunk of you ] car, /  

^2          B.32 utt1:  Trunk # of your car all time,  right. # /
