sd          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ that's a, + that's, ] + that's ]  good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  I wanted to get a school that was small   enough, that was personable --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- that you didn't have a lecture, {F uh, }  hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention -- /

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          A.43 utt2:  {C And so } [ I, + I ] feel like,  number one, [ you ne-, + you also need ]  to see what kind of name the, - /

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- and [ another thing that, + {F uh, }  another reason why ] I chose that was [ the, + the ] finances.  /
sd          A.45 utt2:  I wanted to make sure that I would be  able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through [ four, + three ]  years of the undergraduate work [ and, + and ] have to leave. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {C so } I did a lot of  talking with friends, with family --   

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- with, {F uh, } counselors at high school, and  also read [ some, + some ] books [ on, + on ] the subject [ at the, + at the ] library. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } it was kind of unusual  because [ my, + my ] two older brothers and I all went to [ thr-, + three ] different universities,  depending on what our choice was.  /
%          A.51 utt2: {C So. } -/  

b          B.52 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  <Laughter> Hopefully [ we, + we ] chose the one that   was best for us,  /

sd          B.54 utt3:  {E I mean, } obviously you've taken precautions, {D you know, } or  measures to, {F uh, } try and pay for your children's education,  /
qy          B.54 utt4: {C but } do you think  that that's going to be enough? /  

ng          A.55 utt1:  I don't think so. /  

b^m          B.56 utt1:  No. /  

no          A.57 utt1:  <Laughter> I don't know.  /
sd          A.57 utt2: [ The, + the ]  way that tuition is increasing, {F um, } exponentially --   

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  -- [ [ it's, + it's, ] + <laughter> it's ]  kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow --   

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  -- at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing. /

%          A.63 utt1:   I, {F uh, } -/  

sd          B.64 utt1:  [ [ I, + all I, ] + all I ]  can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy university. /  

sv         A.65 utt1:  <Laughter>  And [ that, + that ]  your children can use the benefits of --

ba         A.67 utt2:   {D Well, } that's an excellent idea,  /
ba^r        A.67 utt3: that's an excellent idea.  /
sd          A.67 utt4:  One thing [ that, + {F uh, } that ]  we did, {F uh, } and my parents, and our family, is that we weren't able to afford, {F um, }  the kind of education that we all desired.  /
sd          A.67 utt5: {C So } my parents stressed that we get  excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships -- /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } scholarships were  very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't. /  

b          B.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.71 utt1:  {C And } what the scholarship could not  supply I was able [ to, + to ] work for [ and + --   

b          B.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.73 utt1:  -- and ] save [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] get. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          A.75 utt2: He had to, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.75 utt3:  once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had to take out some loans,  /
sd          A.75 utt4: {C and } [ he's, + he's ]  working to pay those off. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  

sv          A.77 utt1:  {C So } [ I, + I ] think that [ the, + ]  {F uh, } {D you know, } once you get past, {F uh, } the initial stages of it, that there's different options  you can use  /
sv          A.77 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh } --   

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah. /
