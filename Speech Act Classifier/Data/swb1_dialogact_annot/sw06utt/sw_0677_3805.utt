ad          A.1 utt1:  {F Uh, } go ahead,  /
ad          A.1 utt2:  tell me what you think.  /
qy          A.1 utt3: Do we get our money's worth? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  Hey, listen, if I had my way,  I wouldn't pay my taxes.  /
sv          B.2 utt2:  [ Not with the, +  not with some of the ] things that I hear that  our tax money is going for some ludicrous things. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qy          A.3 utt2: did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night? /  

nn          B.4 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          B.4 utt2: I did not.  /
%          B.4 utt3: I, -/  

sd          A.5 utt1:  {D Well, } they did a thing on the  thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military  we don't need.  /
sv          A.5 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } it's staggering. /  

qo          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } [ how does this grab you? +    How did this grab you? ]  /
%          B.6 utt2:  {F Uh, } this, - /
h          B.6 utt3: {E [ I, +  I ] mean, } [ I'm, +  I'm ] a lady,  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C but } [ this, +  I heard this ] on a Christian program  /
sd          B.6 utt5: {C and } it was, {F uh, } about the N E A  /
sd          B.6 utt6: {C and, } that's the  National Endowment for Arts,  /
sd          B.6 utt7: {C and } [ they fund, +  they funded ] [ this thing, +   this  act ]  on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and  wrote a report about that with our money. /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  {D Well, } there are a lot of things  that people, I think general, -/  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {C And then } it just frosts me terribly. /  

sv          A.9 utt1:  {D Well, } I think it's interesting  to look at, {F uh, } where the money goes,  /
sv          A.9 utt2: {C and } it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go  /
sv          A.9 utt3: [ {C and } -- +    

aa          B.10 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  -- {C and } ] [ I don't think +   generally, I think ] what's interesting is that <throat_clearing> we probably represent the  majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government  /
sv          A.11 utt2:   {C and } how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government  has to operate with. /  

sv          B.12 utt1:  I believe that's true,  /
aa          B.12 utt2: yes. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  {C And } [ that, +  what ]  I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it.  /
sv          A.13 utt2: {E I mean, } we are going to have  to change the people who represent us. /  

aa          B.14 utt1:  That's correct. /  

sv          A.15 utt1:  {E I mean, } {C and } I think it's  going to be real interesting to see  [ and, +  and ] then  force upon them, {F uh, } /  

^2          B.16 utt1:  Heavy involvement from the public. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.17 utt2: right [ that's -- +    

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- [ y-, + ] I think that's ]  the only thing that's going to change it. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: heavy involvement from the public. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  Our anger is going to have [ to, +  to ] give --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- rise [ to, +  to ] more activity  on our part.  /
sd          A.23 utt2: {F Uh, } [ I've, +  I've ] said for years that there's full employment for the politically   active  /
sv          A.23 utt3: {C and } in our society, {F uh, } there's very little full employment.  /
sv          A.23 utt4:   Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off. /  

aa          B.24 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  Eighty percent of the public, according  to Bill Moyers', {F uh, } - /
"          A.25 utt2: recent, {F uh, } - /
"          A.25 utt3:  piece for, {F uh, } - /
sv          A.25 utt4: Public Broadcasting,  which, by the way is a very good use of government money.  I think P B S is wonderful.  /
sd          A.25 utt5:   {C But } this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in  this country [ are, +  are ] seeing their real incomes,  /
sd          A.25 utt6: {C and } thus, standards  of living, decline.  /
sd          A.25 utt7: {C And } twenty percent are seeing theirs improve.  /
sv          A.25 utt8:  That's not a formula for a better society. /  

aa          B.26 utt1:  No,  /
sv          B.26 utt2: it is not.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: It's lopsided, very much  /
%          B.26 utt4: {C so. } -/  

sv          A.27 utt1:  {C And } the government really plays a role in this. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
ba          B.28 utt2: that's right,  /
sv          B.28 utt3: they pull the strings. /  

ar          A.29 utt1:  {E I mean, } {F w-, } {F well, }  they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere-, -/  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right,  /
%          B.30 utt2: the, - /
%          B.30 utt3: yeah  /
x          B.30 utt4: <laughter>.   

sv          A.31 utt1:  {D You know, } {C and } it's really   interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people  in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think  [ of, + of ] the voter revolting.  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C But } people are pretty much getting the picture  that some people get taken care of and others don't  /
sv          A.31 utt3: {C and } they think it's unfair,  /
sv          A.31 utt4:  {C and } when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it.  /
sv          A.31 utt5:   [ I th-, +  I'll tell ] you [ one quick, +  {F uh, } one thing ] very interesting.  /
sd          A.31 utt6:   C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line,  an eight hundred number  /
sd          A.31 utt7: {C and } people can call in and say what they think  about what's going on in this country. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  They expect, opening it for one hour,   

x          B.34 utt1:  <Rustling>.   

+          A.35 utt1:  that they'll get three,   

x          B.36 utt1:  <Rustling>.   

+          A.37 utt1:  hundred thousand telephone calls. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  I'm sure they will. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  {C And } I've thought for years it  would make a lot of sense to [ p-, + create ] an eight hundred number for voters to call  [ and, +  and ] vent their frustration with government.    

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  Like one, eight hundred capitol or  something like that.    

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  {D You know, } [ y-, +  just a number you ]  could call from anywhere, anytime.  /
sv          A.43 utt2: I think that's coming  /
sv          A.43 utt3: {C and } I think [ once, +   once ] people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change.  /
sv          A.43 utt4:  Until then, I think, {D you know, } it's going to be really painful.  /
qh          A.43 utt5: {C So } the question  is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth  /
sv          A.43 utt6:  {C and, } as you said, it's how soon we get involved,  /
sv(^q)          A.43 utt7: {C and } I think we need to  create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call  a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or  I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money  on art that I don't think is art. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: I understand that,  /
sd          B.44 utt3:  {C but } hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it. /  

sv         A.45 utt1:  {D Well, } that's the good thing about  what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck  of a beating [ and, +  and ] deserves some of it, is telling us, {D you know, }  about the problems.  /
sv          A.45 utt2:  {C So } the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here,  because, {D you know, } as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount  of money on our defense spending in this country. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  Over a very long period of time. /  

aa          B.48 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.48 utt2: absolutely. /  

%          A.49 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          B.50 utt1:  We only see the tip of the iceberg only. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  <Laughter> Right. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  {D You know, } there's so much --   

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.54 utt1:  -- of it going on that it would really,  {D you know, } {F uh, } set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  {D Well, } you may be right.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:   What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, {F uh, } we as a society deal  with it  /
sv          A.55 utt3: [ {C and } I, +  {C and } I ] think [ [ it is, +  what you say, it's, ] +  it's ] a, -/
