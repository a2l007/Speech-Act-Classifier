o          @A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
qo          @A.1 utt2: {D Well, } [ ho-, +  how ]  do you feel about, {F uh, } drug testing? /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {F Um, } personally, I don't have a problem  with it, {F uh, }  /
sv          B.2 utt2: I think, {F uh, } as far as, {F uh, } protecting fellow employees,  protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do,  {F um, } it's justified.  /
sv          B.2 utt3: On the other hand, {F um, } I do agree that [ [ it's, +  it's    a, ] + it's an ] invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  {F Um, } [ I would never, +  I would never ]  have a problem with anyone testing me,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C but } I can understand why people would object.  /
sd          B.4 utt3:  {C So, } [ I guess, + {F uh, } I guess, ] {F uh, } I'm kind of mixed on it,   

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  still at this point. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  I am too a little bit,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {E I mean, }  [ I, + I ] don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing, /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.9 utt1:  [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {D you know, } obviously they're probably  not going to be doing a good job and so forth,  /
sd          A.9 utt2: {C but } I don't  really like having to do it.  /
%          A.9 utt3: It, -/  

aa          B.10 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          A.11 utt1:  {C And } I don't like the idea of it,   [ [ it's, +  it's, ] + makes ] too much of a big brother type of thing. /  

aa          B.12 utt1:  That's absolutely right.  /
sv          B.12 utt2:  [ [ It, + it, ] +   {F uh, } I guess it ] all comes down to, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ a, +  a ] definition of, {F uh, }  how much [ out, +  outside ] activities affect your work  /
%          B.12 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } granted, {D you know, }  that, - /
sv          B.12 utt4: [ any, +  any ] kind of drug use [ on, +  on ] company property and whatnot,   

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  [ is, +  is ] definitely not acceptable.  /
sv          B.14 utt2:   {F Uh, } {F uh, } I don't think anybody would ever argue that.    

b          A.15 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  Or, {F uh, } [ any, +  any ]  after affects carrying over into the workday  /
sd          B.16 utt2:  {C but, } {F um, } {D you know, } [ I don't, +  I'm not ] particularly  concerned with what people do, {F um, } after they leave for the day especially [ if I don't, +   if I don't, ] {F uh, } see any results of it the next # day. # /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  # Yeah,  /
aa^r          A.17 utt2: # yeah,  /
sv          A.17 utt3: I think so too.  /
h          A.17 utt4:   {C But, } {D you know, } it's one of those things. /  

%          B.18 utt1:  {D Well, } [ [ it, +  it is, ] +  it,  ] {D you know, } - /
sv          B.18 utt2: on the other hand  [ [ you, +  you've got, ] + {F uh, } you've got ] [ the, +  {F uh, } the ]  possibility of people, {F oh, } - /
sv          B.18 utt3: you've got some people could be arrested for, {F uh, } drug use,  drug dealings and things like that,  /
sv          B.18 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } [ if their, +  if their ] employers name  hits the papers and that [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +    

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  it's ] a mark against them,  /
sv          B.20 utt2:   the company and, {F uh, } {D you know, } what kind of people work there, # what, {F uh, } # -/  

sv          A.21 utt1:  # {C Plus, } I # guess, if they are  in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the  company has lost what they've put into that employee,   

aa          B.22 utt1:  That's right.  /
aa^r          B.22 utt2: That's right. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  and their expertise or whatever. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  [ E-, +  even ] if it is,  {D you know, } a company policy of, {F uh, } immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ there's, +  there's ]  a lot involved there. /  

qy          A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } do you think that, {F um, }  it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing  /
qrr          A.27 utt2: {C or } do you  think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule  /
qrr          A.27 utt3: {C or }  would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it? /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  [ I think, +  I think ] the regular  schedule stuff, {F um, } that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point,  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  I never really thought of it that way. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ if, +  if ]  they have time enough they can,   

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: if # they really can, # /  

+          A.31 utt1:  # stay off of it. # /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {F um, } I think [ the big-, +  the biggest ]  problem I've got [ is, +  is ] forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {F Um, } as far as the new hires, [ I, +  I ]  hired on just early enough that [ I, +  I ] missed it. {F Um, } where the new hires were  concerned  /
%          B.34 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } [ [ not, +  nobody, ] +  no, ]  /
sv          B.34 utt3: I don't think anybody questions that, {F um, }  testing someone [ as a, +  as a ] precondition to being hired  /
sv          B.34 utt4: {C but, } {F um, }  for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the  job [ [ that's, +  [ I, +  I ] don't know, that, ] +  that's ] where I think that most people get upset.  /
sv          B.34 utt5:  [ [ It's, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } it, ] +  it's ] changing the rules in the middle of the game  basically  /
sv          B.34 utt6: {C and, } {F uh, }   

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  [ [ It's just, +  it, ] +  it's ]  a really tough question  /
%          B.36 utt2: {C and } [ it, +   {D you know, } it, ] - /
sv          B.36 utt3: people [ have, +  have ] really quieted down after  everything started  /
sv          B.36 utt4: {C but } I still think [ there's a lot of, +  there's a lot of ] resentment. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:  I think so too, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.37 utt2: I know [ the, +   the ] group I was in at the time this all came up they, {F uh, } were quite vocal about it,   through electronic mail,  /
sd          A.37 utt3: boy, they just really,   

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  {D you know } <laughter>, let them have  it from one end to the other,    

ba          B.40 utt1:  You bet. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  vehemently  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } it  has quieted down,  /
sv          A.41 utt3: {C but } I don't think they probably feel any differently, /  

aa          B.42 utt1:  No, #  /
aa          B.42 utt2: that's right. # /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  # {C and } [ some, +  # some ]  of them did quit the company. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: [ I, +  I ] know of some people  who did, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.44 utt3: [ it was, +  it was ] indirectly related, {D you know,  /
sd          B.44 utt4: } they could always  come up with other reasons  /
sd          B.44 utt5: {C but } [ it, +  it ] had a lot to do with it. Just [ the, +  the ]  whole attitude,  /
%          B.44 utt6: {C because } [ it's really, +  {F uh, } it's just really, ] - /
sv          B.44 utt7: [ it, +  it ] seems so  un-, - /
sd          B.44 utt8: T I, {D you know, } with [ the, +  the ] whole relaxed atmosphere that we have,   

b          A.45 utt1:  True. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  {F um, } to all of a sudden, {F uh, }  search for  ((   ))  attitudes and whatnot.  /
sv          B.46 utt2:  {D You know, } there's not a lot of pressure [ to, + to  ]  vote the right way or anything else around T I.  /

aa          B.52 utt1:  Absolutely not, {D you know, }  /
%          B.52 utt2: [ [ it's, +   it's, ] +  it's, ] {D you know, } - /

sd          B.52 utt4: supposedly your grade was  a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with  /
ad          B.52 utt5: {C so, } {F uh, }  {D you know, } [ let's, +  let's ] stick with that original trust, I guess. /

sv          B.54 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ [ it's, +  it's still, ]  +  [ it, +  it ] still ] remains a tough question  /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C and, } [ it's, +  there's ] a lot of, {D you know, }  [ the whole, +  the whole ] department of defense, {F uh, } reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot.  /
sv          B.54 utt3:  There's a lot of different things that, {F uh, } come into play  /

sv          B.54 utt5: I think [ everybody, +  everybody ] pretty much knows that that was kind of  a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:  {D Well, } I guess too if  I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing.

b          B.60 utt1:  Yeah.  /

sv          B.60 utt4:  [ [ I, + I ] guess, +  I guess ] what I'm trying to get at is, [ [ if it, +  if it, ] +  if it ]  does help a few individuals [ maybe, +  maybe ] it's worth it. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.62 utt1:  {F Um, } {D you know, } it may prevent  somebody who [ was, +  was ] teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot  /
