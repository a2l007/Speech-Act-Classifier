sv          B.20 utt3: {C and } a few people I guess will  make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth. /  

ba          A.21 utt1:  I imagine.  /
sv          A.21 utt2:  Your oil companies, they may see,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /

sv(^q)          A.45 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C but } I know that that's  causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like, Gee, you told us,

sv          B.54 utt2: [ {C and } +   {F uh, } {C and } ] {F uh, } Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along,

aa          A.57 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.58 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } then he underestimated  his ability [ to, +  to ] wage a war with us.  /
