sd          A.11 utt6: [ I won't make, +   I won't have ] a sharp cheddar because [ it, +  for fondue I think it ]  should be a little calmer than real sharp,   

b          B.12 utt1:  Right. /

sd          A.25 utt2:   You take little toothpicks and cut up,   

b          B.26 utt1:  Oh. /

sv          B.38 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think [ it would, +   it would ] be a lot of work  /

sv          B.40 utt4: {C and, } {D you know, } I think they're worth the time,  {D you know, } because they, -/  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: you [ probably +  get [ this, + ]  probably ] pretty sticky after you get done. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah  /
x          B.42 utt2: <laughter>.   

sd          A.43 utt1:  Then you've got to drain the water  out of the watermelon because, {D you know, } when you scrape it, it makes the water. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.44 utt2:  Yeah. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /

qy          B.46 utt1:  [ Is that, +  is that ] good?  /
sd          B.46 utt2:  {D You know, } I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate  /
sd          B.46 utt3:  {C but } I've never tried it,  /
qy          B.46 utt4: are they really good? /  

ny          A.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.47 utt2: [ ther-, +  {D you know, }  if you get a sweet strawberry they're ] much better,  /

%          A.49 utt8: {C so. } -/  

ba          B.50 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D well, } that's good  /
sd          B.50 utt2: {C because }  I know they've been really expensive lately.    

b          A.51 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  Because they weren't in season,  /

%          A.63 utt1:  {F Um, }  (( it filled )) , - /
sv          A.63 utt2: a lot of  people try to stay away from this  /
sd          A.63 utt3: {C but } I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding. /  

bh          B.64 utt1:  Is that right?  /
sd          B.64 utt2: I've never heard of that. /  

ny          A.65 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.65 utt2: [ it, +  {C and } it ]  ((   ))   if you, {F um, } {D well, } - /
sd          A.65 utt3: (( first of all ))   I  ((   ))  take about a quarter and a half of milk  /
sd          A.65 utt4:  {C and } I put it in a two quart saucepan  /
ad          A.65 utt5: {C and } you put it on a really low heat. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

ad          A.67 utt1:  {C And } you want to use one of your  good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because [ it, +  it ] ends up burning,  /
sd          A.67 utt2:  {E I mean, } no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  I  (( don't ))  let that worry me.  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  {C And } I get the  (( milk ))  lukewarm  /
sd          A.69 utt3: {C and then } I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it  /
sd          A.69 utt4:  {C and } I have this thing  /
sd          A.69 utt5: it's called the slender blender,  /
sd          A.69 utt6: [ [ it, + it ] makes   the, + {F uh, } it makes, {F uh, } a ] whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough.  /
h          A.69 utt7:  It's, {F uh, } I don't know, - /
sd          A.69 utt8: they're called (( moo goo leaves ))  or something  /
%          A.69 utt9: they're sl-, -/  

sv          B.70 utt1:  I think I know what you're talk-, - /
qy          B.70 utt2:  is it {D like } a hand held? /  

ny          A.71 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.71 utt2:  They're real neat. /  

%          B.72 utt1:  The, - /
bk          B.72 utt2: yeah,  /
bk          B.72 utt3: okay. /  

sv          A.73 utt1:  I think they're real reasonably priced,  /
sd          A.73 utt2: some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars <noise>,  /
sd          A.73 utt3: {C and } they used  to whip skim milk into a dessert  /
sd          A.73 utt4: {C but } I didn't get that one,  /
sd          A.73 utt5: I got the Black and  Decker kind.  /
sv          A.73 utt6: {C But, } {F uh, } it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord  /
ad          A.73 utt7:  {C and } you beat this cornstarch right into [ the mil-, +  the milk, ] {D you know, }  /
sv          A.73 utt8:  {C and } it does an excellent job,  /
sd          A.73 utt9: {C or } just hand beat it.  /
sd          A.73 utt10:  I guess you could use a hand mixer  /
sv          A.73 utt11:  {C but } [ I don't think it pur-, +  I don't think it gets ] it good enough. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  {C And then } before the milk gets  too hot, {F um, } I add two beaten eggs  and I really mix them in good.  And then about  a half a cup of sugar  /
sd          A.75 utt2: {C and } I let it pretty much,  /
sd          A.75 utt3: I beat it {D like } every minute  for about ten seconds  /
sd          A.75 utt4: {C and } [ it's, +  it starts ] thickening,  /
sd          A.75 utt5: when it thickens the  cornstarch might get a little, I don't know, - /
sd          A.75 utt6: it gets {D like } little globs  of this rubbery cornstarch, /  

b@          B.76 utt1:  {F Oh, } huh.   

ad          A.77 utt1:  {C and } you just keep beating it in.  /
%          A.77 utt2:   {C And } it's the, - /
sd          A.77 utt3: the trick [ is, +  is ] to have this blender,  /
%          A.77 utt4: {C so, } if you were, - /
sv          A.77 utt5: you'd have  to probably almost go out  /
sd          A.77 utt6: {C and }  ((   )) someone who's just going to make it first time,  it's, - /
sd          A.77 utt7: you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. /  

+          B.78 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  {C And then } you can add cocoa  powder to it to make chocolate  /
sd          A.79 utt2: {C or } after it's thickened I cook it for a good, - /
sd          A.79 utt3: once it starts boiling, [ I just, +  I ] cook it for a good [ seven minutes, +    

b          B.80 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.81 utt1:  seven to ten minutes ]  /
sd          A.81 utt2: {C and then } you  can make chocolate  /
sd          A.81 utt3: {C or } you can take it off and let it cool  ((   )) - /
sd          A.81 utt4: you put, {F um, }  really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter  /
sd          A.81 utt5: {C and } that makes french vanilla,  {F um, } custard.  /
%          A.81 utt6: Yeah, /  

ba          B.82 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow.  /

sd          A.97 utt1:  {D Well, } I used to make the regular  pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell  /

%          A.109 utt1:  {F um, }  (( yeah  /

sd(^q)          A.117 utt1:  {C Because } I'm always worrying it  won't firm up because [ it, +  when you take it ]  out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope  this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, {D you know, }  /

b          B.120 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.121 utt1:  {C And then } once the pudding starts  cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap,  /
sd          A.121 utt2: {C so, } when you pull the Saran  Wrap back, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and  shake the water off the Saran Wrap  /
