o          B.1 utt1:  You think about AIDS research? /  

sv          @A.2 utt1:  {D Well, } AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,  /
sd          @A.2 utt2:  {C and } you die from it.  /
sv          @A.2 utt3:  {C So } I think that, {F uh, } they need to look into it  /
sv          @A.2 utt4:  {C and } it's kind of like cancer.  /
h          @A.2 utt5:  I don't, {D you know, } - /
qh          @A.2 utt6: how many years have  we tried to find a cure for cancer. /  

b          B.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.4 utt1:  I think it'll probably be as difficult.  /
qo          A.4 utt2:  {F Uh, } how about yourself. /  

sd          B.5 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } I'm certainly in  favor of AIDS research,  /
sv          B.5 utt2: {C and } I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.  /
sv          B.5 utt3:   I think that - /
sd          B.5 utt4:  {C because, } besides the fact that it's a  deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's, {F um, } - /
sv          B.5 utt5:  although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control  and become a huge problem. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.6 utt2: they say a million people are infected --   

b          B.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.8 utt1:  -- with the H I V virus,  /
%          A.8 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, }  # yeah,  /
sv          A.8 utt3: I think, # -/  

qr^d          B.9 utt1:  # That's in the world, # or # in America?  /
%          B.9 utt2:  You, # -/  

sd          A.10 utt1:  # {F Uh, } in the country, America. # /  

bh          B.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

ny          A.12 utt1:  Yeah -- /  

%          B.13 utt1:  {F Um, } that's, -/  

sd          A.14 utt1:  -- {C and } they have millions. /  

qw          B.15 utt1:  Whose figure is that? /  

sd          A.16 utt1:  I don't know.  /
sd          A.16 utt2: I've just heard it on the radio. /  

bk          B.17 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          A.18 utt1:  Sometimes you hear things [ that, +  on the radio that, ] {D you know, } could be true or couldn't be. /  

b          B.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qy          A.20 utt1:  {F Uh, } do you feel like this is, - /
sv          A.20 utt2:  [ I, + I ] guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research. /  

b          B.21 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qy          A.22 utt1:  Do you think they should spend more? /  

ng          B.23 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think they should,  {D actually, } although [ prob-, + perhaps ] not [ a, + an ] incredible amount more than what they're doing,  /
sv          B.23 utt2:  {C and } I don't necessarily think that they should, {F uh, } fund AIDS research  and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.  /
sv          B.23 utt3: I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general. /  

qw          A.24 utt1:  What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson? /  

sd          B.25 utt1:  {F Um } --   

qy^d          A.26 utt1:  Magic? /  

+          B.27 utt1:  -- [ {D well, } I, + {D well, } I ]  am sorry that he has the virus.  /
h          B.27 utt2:  [ I, + {F um, } I ] don't know,  /
sv          B.27 utt3: [ I don't, + I think ] it's very strange that  the media hasn't, {F um, } questioned him more strongly [ to, +  about ] gay sex or  intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people. /  

qy          A.28 utt1:  Do you think he's the hero that he's  being called by [ a bunch of other, +  a bunch of the ] media? /  

ng          B.29 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ not, + not ]   really, though {E I mean, } I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,  /
sv          B.29 utt2:  {C but } I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.  /
sv          B.29 utt3:  It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous. /  

sd          A.30 utt1:  {D You know, } I took advantage of  the opportunity when, {D you know, } he came out.  /
sd          A.30 utt2: I talked to my kids about it, {D you know } -- /  

b          B.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.32 utt1:  -- it's something that I [ hadn't, +   hadn't ] done before. /  

b^r          B.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.34 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

ba          B.35 utt1:  {D Well, } that's good. /  

sd          A.36 utt1:  I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed  his tune on, {F uh, } safe sex to abstinence,  /
sv          A.36 utt2: {E or } --   

b          B.37 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.38 utt1:  -- I was glad he did that, for young kids,  because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting. /  

b^r          B.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

^h          A.40 utt1:  {F Uh, } let's see.  /
qw          A.40 utt2: What are some of  the other questions.  /
%          A.40 utt3: {F Uh, } you don't, {F uh, } - /
^h          A.40 utt4:  let's see.  /
sd          A.40 utt5: I don't have any friends that   have the disease.  /
qy^d          A.40 utt6:  I guess you [ might, +  might ] not. /  

ny          B.41 utt1:  {F Um, } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.41 utt2: I do.  /
sd          B.41 utt3: My cousin, does, for instance. /  

qy          A.42 utt1:  Is it pretty --   

%          B.43 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } -/  

+          A.44 utt1:  -- nasty? /  

ny          B.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ny^r          B.45 utt2: yeah  /
sd^e          B.45 utt3: it is.  /
sd          B.45 utt4:  He's actually, {F um, } - /
sd          B.45 utt5:  he had AIDS related complex for a while,  /
sd          B.45 utt6: {C and } he is now in full-blown AIDS,  really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or [ some-, +  that sort of thing. ] /  

b          A.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.46 utt2: it sounds awful. /  

aa          B.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.47 utt2: [ it's, + it's ] a very nasty thing. /  

qy          A.48 utt1:  Is it just that the immune system ceases  to function properly  /
%          A.48 utt2: {C and, } -/  

ny          B.49 utt1:  {F Um, } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.49 utt2: [ that's, +  that's ]  basically it, that, {F um, }  the immune system can at first slow down,  /
sd          B.49 utt3: {C and } the white blood cell  count goes down,  /
sd          B.49 utt4: [ which is, +  that's ] AIDS Related Complex,  /
sd          B.49 utt5: {C but } then when  things get completely out of control and  it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS -- /  

%          A.50 utt1:  {C And, } -/  

sd          B.51 utt1:  -- {C and } in that case, {D you know, }  people are prone to getting any kind of, {D you know, } weird cancer that only animals got before -- /  

b          A.52 utt1: {F Oh, } really. /
