===========================================================================
  

o          @A.1 utt1:  Okay.  /
sd          @A.1 utt2: The question was, {F um, }  [ what, +  what ] is your opinion of youth, {F uh, } spending a year or two [ in, + in ] public service. /  

sv          B.2 utt1:  I think it would be a great idea.  /
sv          B.2 utt2:   I'm not sure about requiring it, {D you know, } of people, because people are going,  {D you know, } feeling resentful.  /
h          B.2 utt3: I don't know,  /
sv          B.2 utt4: {C but } I think it would be a great idea. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  Seems like there's so many kids that  don't have any <cough> since of, {D you know, } what they want to be or do  /
sv          B.4 utt2:  {C or, } {D you know, } they could learn something and  maybe help other people at the same time  /
sv          B.4 utt3:  {C and } [ [ we, +  sure, our country, ] +  all countries sure ] need help  /
%          B.4 utt4: {C so, } -/  

b          A.5 utt1:  Huh-uh.  /
qy          A.5 utt2:  [ Would, +  {F uh, } would ]  you be more in favor of, {F uh, } {D you know, } {D like } a local, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.5 utt3: my only experience with it,  I was in Central America for a while,    

b          B.6 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.7 utt1:  and, {F uh, } in San Salvador, in El Salvador, /  

b^r          B.8 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  For instance, everybody had what they  called there social year,   

b          B.10 utt1:  {F Oh, } really. /  

+         A.11 utt1:  that they had to put in  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C and } basically  it was a, {F uh, } repayment [ for, +  for, ] {F uh, } high school education, /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C and } most of them joined the Red  Cross  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C and } it was done internally.  /
%          A.13 utt3:  I just, - /
sd          A.13 utt4: there was very little external.  /
sv          A.13 utt5:   I think possibly what, {F uh, } they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps,   

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  Type things where we're sending people off shore. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  {D Well, } I think that would be real  interesting for people to do,  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C but, } I guess, my concern about that would be the cost  involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them, {D you know, } to other countries, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

h          B.18 utt1:  [ {C and, } +  {C but, } ] I don't know.  /
sv         B.18 utt2:  If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries  that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really, {D you know, } send children to do that. -/  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  I didn't know. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  [ I don't, +  I don't ] know how the  Peace Corps works,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in,    

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.22 utt2: I was too. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  and all that. /  

sd          B.24 utt1:  I thought seriously about joining at  that time,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: I thought it was a fantastic idea. /  

qy          A.25 utt1:  Did you ever get any information on it {D like, } -/  

sd          B.26 utt1:  I sent off for stuff on it,  /
sd          B.26 utt2:  {C but } I don't remember that much.  about it.  /
sd          B.26 utt3:  I know that they trained you in the language  /
%          B.26 utt4: {C and, } {F um, } -/  

sd          A.27 utt1:  That's what I was wondering about  was whether they actually, -/  

sd          B.28 utt1:  You actually got paid too,  while in the Peace Corps,  /
sv          B.28 utt2: it wasn't much, /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  {C but } I guess, [ they, +  you ]  could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and, -/  

qy          A.31 utt1:  Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps? /  

ny          B.32 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^e          B.32 utt2: I think so,  /
ny          B.32 utt3: yeah,  /
ny^r          B.32 utt4: yeah <laughter>. /  

x          A.33 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.34 utt1:  {C But } it might be interesting to  see what would happen if you took kids [ at a, + ]   and then took then to another country instead   of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex <laughter> and  everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral   values <laughter>, like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink <laughter>. /  

bf          A.35 utt1:  Where they couldn't do that.  /
%          A.35 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.35 utt3: you might end up with a revolution.  /
sv          A.35 utt4:  I don't know which end though. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Really <laughter>. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.37 utt2: yeah.  /
sv          A.37 utt3:  [ That's, + that's ]  been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, {D you know, } coming back right now, {D you know. } /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv(^q)          A.39 utt1:  You wonder if being exposed to that for  a while, what percentage of them would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way  to do it,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C because } from what I understand, from some of the guys I know,  {D you know, } crime, {F uh, } is punishable, just almost, {F uh, } instantly and --   

^2          B.40 utt1:  Public hanging. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- public,  /
aa          A.41 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          A.41 utt3: Public  hanging and this sort of thing, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.41 utt4: {C so } you don't have just a whole lot of,   

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.43 utt1:  what we consider street crimes. /  

b^r          B.44 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.44 utt2:  I've heard that {D like } in China and  stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody  you'd be murdered, {D you know, } on the, {D you know, } street  /
%          B.44 utt3: {C so, } -/  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.45 utt2:  {D Well, } I guess that's,  {F uh, } the price of freedom, I guess, is a little, {D anyway, }  /
sd          A.45 utt3: [ [ the, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } the, ] +   the ] public service thing again - /
sv          A.45 utt4: [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ] guess, in my own, having had the whole three or  four minutes to, {D you know, } give it a great deal of thought, {D you know, }    

x          B.46 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.47 utt1:  {F Um, } [ I, +  I ] think I agree with  you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,  /
sv          A.47 utt2: {C but } when you do that then it becomes almost, {F uh, } a  ((   )) , - /
%          A.47 utt3:  {C or } it can be, /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.49 utt1:  {D You know, } there have, - /
sv          A.49 utt2: people will  kind of set up their own little club, /  

aa          B.50 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.50 utt2: that's true. /  

%          A.51 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] if, {D you know, } -/  

sv          B.52 utt1:  People that might benefit most from it  might not go in that situation, {D you know, } like people that really are trapped in  a ghetto or something like that. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.54 utt1:  Might not go if it was voluntary,  /
sd          B.54 utt2:  {C but } I don't know how they'd enforce it,  /
%          B.54 utt3: if it was, -/  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qh          A.55 utt2: {D well, } if they went AWOL,  what are you going to do. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

ad          A.57 utt1:  Shoot them. /  

x          B.58 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

ad          A.59 utt1:  Put them in jail <laughter>. /  

h          B.60 utt1:  I don't know.  /
ad          B.60 utt2:  Send them over to Iraq <laughter>. /  

aa          A.61 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /
aa          A.61 utt2: right. /  

ad          B.62 utt1:  Have a vacation in Iraq for a year <laughter>. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  I know my dad always talked about,  {F uh, } - /
sd          A.63 utt2: he was in C C C during, {F uh, } -/  

b         B.64 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.65 utt1:  {C And } he was, {F uh, } a rock rib  Iowa type republican  /
sd          A.65 utt2: {C and } the only good thing he could ever say about, {F uh, }  the whole Roosevelt administration was, {F uh, } civilian conservation corps, /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  {C because } he was in it.  /
sd          A.67 utt2:  He thought that was great. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  The rest of it was all hog wash,  /
sd          A.69 utt2:  {C but } that was great. /  

sv          B.70 utt1:  {D Well, } it seems like it would  develop pride, {D you know, } in people, [ if, +  if, ] it's in their own country.  /
sv          B.70 utt2:   It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some  pride in them, if it was handled that way.  /
%          B.70 utt3:  [ I, + I, ] - /
sv          B.70 utt4: it would take quite a   few people.  /
sv          B.70 utt5:  I think it might build jobs for people, {D you know, } that were  administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,  /
sv          B.70 utt6: {C  so } maybe that part of it would be helpful too. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          B.72 utt1:  I don't know. /  

b^r          A.73 utt1:  Yeah  /

sv          A.75 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know } that brings up  the interesting subject too, {D you know, }  /
qw          A.75 utt2: [ what would you have, + [ [ who, +  who, ] + who ]  would determine ] what these people do. /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.76 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          A.77 utt1:  {D You know, } [ if, +  {F uh, }  {D you know, } if ] it's run by the individual state. - /
sd          A.77 utt2: {D You know }  {D like } C C C was run by the army  /

b          B.78 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          A.79 utt1:  {C and } the only opposition to it  really was that it was, {D you know, } starting some sort of a military elitist type, {D you know, }  special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing. /  

b^r          B.80 utt1:  Huh-uh. /

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.82 utt2: really there could be, {F um, }  some scandals involved, if, {D you know, } it wasn't people that were really fair and [ le-, +    

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  {D you know, } in a legal ] way or something,  /
sv          B.84 utt2:  they could send all the people over to, {F uh, } {D you know, } one particular  part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, {D you know, }  get supported,  /
%          B.84 utt3: {C or, } -/
