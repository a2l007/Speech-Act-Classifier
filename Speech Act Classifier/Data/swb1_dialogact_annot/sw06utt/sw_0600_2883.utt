qy          A.1 utt2:  [ did you like, +  do you use ] credit cards? /  

ng          B.2 utt1:  {F Uh, } not very often.  /
sd          B.2 utt2:  I usually, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.2 utt3: the ones we use is  {D like } Visa  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } we always try to pay it back at the end of the month. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

%          B.4 utt1:   (( I have, {F uh, } {F uh, } )) . -/  

bf          A.5 utt1:  So it doesn't  (( get )) ,  {F uh, } {F uh, } the credit, {F uh, } /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.7 utt1:  the interest rate is so  high that you're really, - /
qy^g          A.7 utt2:  if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy,  I think, don't you?   <Ringing>. /  

ny          B.8 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  

sv          A.9 utt1:  Otherwise, you end up paying so  much more for your merchandise that [ it's hardly, +    

aa          B.10 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.11 utt1:  {F uh, } it's not ] a very good idea. /  

qy          B.12 utt1:  Do you have a lot of credit cards? /  

na          A.13 utt1:  {D Well, } I have a lot of them  /
sd^e          A.13 utt2:  {C but } I don't use them very much, though. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  <Laughter> I use them mostly for big things,  like maybe, sometimes, {F uh, } tuition [ if it's, + {D you know, } if I'm ]  short, to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can.  /
sv          A.15 utt2:  The other thing, [ I, +  I ] think if you do get overextended a little bit, you need to  be sure and pay it off, {F uh, } more than one at a time, because   I think you could run forever paying what they require. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  Just goes on and on. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  Which is what they want. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)          B.20 utt1:  I think a lot of people go in debt  because they think, {F oh, } {D you know, } I can just charge it,  /
sv          B.20 utt2: {C but } really,  {E I mean, } if they don't have the money then, they aren't going to have it in a month,  /
%          B.20 utt3: {C so, } -/  

aa          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.21 utt2: that's true. /  

sv          B.22 utt1:  they, {F uh, } make the mistake of,   

sv          A.23 utt1:  # There are times, #   

+          B.24 utt1:  #  (( pushing all their cards )) . # /  

+          A.25 utt1:  [ when it's, + when it's ] very useful,   

b          B.26 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          A.27 utt1:  # like, # {F uh, } emergency trip,   

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  or something.  /
%          A.29 utt2: Sometimes [ when you, +   when you, ] - /
sd          A.29 utt3: the money will be available,  /
sd          A.29 utt4: {C but } it's, {D you know, } not immediately handy.  /
sv          A.29 utt5:   I think, {F uh, } they're very helpful,  plus the fact that it's helpful not to  have to carry a lot of money sometimes. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ I, +  you ]  really do need to be very, {F um, } {F oh, }  responsible about it  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C or } you end up in deep trouble. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> Yeah.  /
sd          B.32 utt2:  I made  that mistake when I first got a job  /
%          B.32 utt3: {C and } that's kind of like, - /
sd          B.32 utt4:  it took me quite a while to pay them off, /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {C so } [ af-, +  after ] that I decided,  {D well, } I'm not going to use them at all, and  just try to pay cash for everything  /
sd          B.34 utt2:  {C and } that worked for a while  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and then } we got married  /
sd          B.34 utt4: {C so } we decided [ to, +   {D you know, } if ] we used them we would pay them off as we go. /  

b          A.35 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.36 utt1:  {D So, } -/  

b^r          A.37 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          A.37 utt2:  That can be very handy under  those kind of circumstances.  /
sv          A.37 utt3: The other thing about them is too, [ if you really don't, +  you really need ] to get some and use them because if you have never  used them [ and developed, +  and  haven't developed ] a credit thing.   It stops you from doing a lot of things.  /
sd          A.37 utt4: [ If you, +    

b          B.38 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  if you ] pay for everything by cash,  {F uh, } there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit  when you need something like a house or,    

aa          B.40 utt1:  That's true,  /
aa          B.40 utt2: yeah. /  

+          A.41 utt1:  a car.  /
sv          A.41 utt2: [ {C So, } + {C so } ] [ they, +   they ] have become a very vital part [ of our, +  of our ] monetary system <laughter>,   

b          B.42 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          A.43 utt1:  # over the # last few years.  /
sv          A.43 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } it's true,  /
sv          A.43 utt3: you have to be very careful or you end up, {F uh, } going in the deep end  /
sv          A.43 utt4:  [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] an awful lot of people are in trouble. /  

b^r          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  We have a boy living with us who works  for a credit card, {F uh, } company that, - /
sd          A.45 utt2:  {C and } he makes calls to people who have problems,  {D you know, } credit problems,   

b          B.46 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  that are trying to work out  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  {C and, } {F uh, } <laughter>. Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night <laughter>,   

b          B.48 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  because the world has so  many problems of that sort,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {D so } [ [ [ it's, +    

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  it's, ] +  {F uh, } it's, ] +  {F uh, } it's ]  a really big problem I think, and, {F um, } takes mature people [ to, +  to ]  treat it, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.51 utt2:  [ so that it's, +  so that it's ] a real advantage to you, instead of a disadvantage. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.52 utt2:  I think, {F um, } the way the tax  system was, they encouraged people to use credit cards, {D you know, } with a big  write off at the end of the year. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But } now, [ it's {D like, } + it's ]   punch money, because <laughter> -- -/

na          B.56 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.56 utt3:  You cannot write off your interest. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  Even before it probably wasn't, though, because [ you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it, +    

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  you didn't get to claim anywhere  near what you ] ended up paying.  /
sd          A.59 utt2: {D So, } {D well, } I'm not, - /
sd          A.59 utt3:  other than that, I don't have too much on credit cards  /
