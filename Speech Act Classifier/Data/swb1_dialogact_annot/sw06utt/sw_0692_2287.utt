b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.31 utt2: it's kind of like in Louisiana  where that, {F uh, } guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan --   

aa          B.32 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  -- member something got elected. /

sv          A.35 utt1:  Kind of scary when you think about that. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          B.36 utt3: he's so off the wall that, {F uh, } he's gone in and tried to  get into city elections  /
sd          B.36 utt4: [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] [ he's got, +  he's been ]  put away for, {F uh, } credit card fraud, I believe. /  

ba          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } gosh. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sv          A.43 utt1:  Next thing you know, you've got him. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  Right.  /
sv(^q)          B.44 utt2:  If you don't go and  vote, then, {D you know, } very good chance that [ they, +  they ] will --    

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- because a lot of the people like  that, they'll strike a chord [ in something, +  {D you know, } in some ]  of the people, that so will say, look, {D you know, } this guy's got everything together.  /
^q          B.46 utt2:  {D You know, } I like what he says,  /
sv          B.46 utt3: {C and } he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Right, yeah. /  

qy^g          B.48 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } I think that's sort  of what happened with Louisiana --    

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:  I think one thing that maybe  would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail  it in, or something like, [ if you have, +  if you have ] real strict work hours, and  you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and  you have to stand in line for so long -- /  

b          B.56 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.57 utt1:  -- I think that discourages a lot of people. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  What we do, usually, is, {F uh, }  vote, {F uh, } absenteeism -- /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          B.60 utt3: you can just go and vote -- /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  -- {C and } the polls are open,   what was it, a couple of weeks,  /
sv          B.62 utt2: the hours are good  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C and } they're even open on Saturdays --   

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.64 utt1:  -- and a couple of Sundays.  /
sd          B.64 utt2: {C And so }  we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, [ it's, + ] {F uh, } the lines are long. /  

b          A.65 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.65 utt2: I'm in Dallas,  /
sd          A.65 utt3: {C and } they're long here too. /

b          A.67 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.67 utt2: I voted absentee one year.  /
sd          A.67 utt3:   I really was going to be gone.  /
sd          A.67 utt4:  {C So, } I did it,  /
sv          A.67 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } it was nice.  /
sd          A.67 utt6:   I would be tempted to do it again. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I recommend it,  because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line -- /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.70 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  that vote's just as good as, {D you know, } the one on election day. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.71 utt2:  I think they should change  the whole system so that it's easier -- /

b          B.72 utt2: yeah. /

sd          B.74 utt2: I've been involved with,  {F uh, } some of the campaigns and the state conventions [ of the, +  of the ] Republican party.  /
sv          B.74 utt3:  {C And } it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through  as far as the voting and [ the, +  {F uh, } [ how the, +  {F uh, } the ] not the ] ballots,  /
sd          B.74 utt4:  {C but, } {F uh, } my mind has gone blank.  /

x          A.75 utt1:  <Laughter>.

sv          B.78 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } [ it's, +  it's ] interesting. /  

aa          A.79 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.79 utt2: that would be.  /
sd          A.79 utt3:  I usually vote.  /
sd          A.79 utt4: A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take  the time to find out [ what every, +  {D you know, } other than the major candidates,  what they ] stand for --    

b          B.80 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
