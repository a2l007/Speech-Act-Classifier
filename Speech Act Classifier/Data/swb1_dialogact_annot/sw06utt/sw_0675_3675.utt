ny          B.2 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.2 utt2: our budgeting plan includes  me getting a job <laughter>. /  

x          @A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.4 utt1:  [ We're, +  we're ] at the point now,  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  [ I go-, +  I quit ] working about six months ago to start this house -- /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  -- {C and } I'm out of cash  /
sd          B.6 utt2:  {C and } I'm not out of project yet. /  

ba          A.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {C So, } {F uh, } I'm going to go back  and do some consulting work.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: As far as budget's concerned, [ I'm,  + I'm ] fairly fortunate.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:   {F Uh, } [ we've, +  we're ] [ right now where if we don't buy anything extra,  we can make it on what my wife makes.  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C So, } {D you know, } the project's kind  of halted until then.  /
sd          B.8 utt5:  {C But } as far as budgeting is concerned, {D you know, }  we have, {F uh, } some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, {D you know,  /
sd          B.8 utt6:  } we always put ten percent back,  /
sd          B.8 utt7: {C and } that's a never touch. /  

bf          A.9 utt1:  {F Uh, } into savings. /  

aa          B.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  Either savings or investment, one of the two,  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  {C but } we don't ever put it in a high risk.  /
sd          B.12 utt3: It's just always going to be there. /  

ba          A.13 utt1:  {D Well, } that's pretty good. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  {C And } as far as the rest of it's  concerned, we don't have any kind of, {F uh, } what I would call extravagant expenses, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.14 utt2:  [ we, + {F uh, } we ] pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, {D you know, }  just travel to and from work and clothing and food -- /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  Boy, that's pretty good. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  -- {C and } the rest of it, {D you know, }  we pile into the house.  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I'm fairly fortunate.  /
sd          B.16 utt3:   {E I mean, } our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm --   

b          A.17 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- a little behind on that,  /
sd          B.18 utt2:  {C but, } {F uh, } we're still making the payments on them.  /
sd          B.18 utt3: It's just, when you, - /
sd          B.18 utt4: {D see } in Texas  you cannot borrow the money to build your own home --   

b          A.19 utt1:  # Yeah, # -- /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- # and do it yourself. # /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- [ it's, +  it's ] tough here too.  /
sd          A.21 utt2:  You have to have the contractor sign with you. /  

aa          B.22 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.22 utt2: exactly. /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  {C But } it's easy to find a contractor  for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  --  ((   )) , where I live, that is. -/  

sd          B.26 utt1:  {C And } where I live, [ it, +  it's ]  pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor  sign on your note like that --   

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.28 utt1:  -- and you screw up, you don't get  it finished,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: the bank can eat the contractor. /  

bf          A.29 utt1:  {F Oh, } bad for him, {F huh. } /  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^m          B.30 utt2: bad for him.  /
sd          B.30 utt3:   {C But, } the homeowner can't be touched. /  

%          A.31 utt1:  # {F Um. } # /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  # It's a # homestead state. /  

qy          A.33 utt1:  Is that right? /  

ny          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.34 utt2: {D see } right now if I quit   paying any of my bills,  /
sd          B.34 utt3: the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.  /
sd          B.34 utt4:   They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period. /  

ba          A.35 utt1:  Wow. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {D You know. }  They can take your  car and your clothes and your, anything  /
sd          B.36 utt2: that's not the tools of your trade,  /
sv          B.36 utt3:  {C but } as far as, {F uh, } you know <laughter>, you're pretty much bullet proof in this state. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  {D Well, } that's kind of handy. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  Pretty interesting. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  Texas has quite the history. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ we're, +   we're ] not ones to budget much, {D you know } <laughter>. /  

x          A.45 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.46 utt1:  We just going to spend it all. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  <Laughter> That's kind of what we do.  /
sd          A.47 utt2:  [ We, +  {F uh, } we're ] L D S  /
sd          A.47 utt3: {C and so } we pay ten percent --   

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- tithing -- /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.51 utt1:  -- {C and then, } {D you know, }  we put I guess it's {D like } fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C But } that sometimes we use for emergency type things. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  [ {C But, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ]  my wife doesn't work.  /
sv          A.55 utt2:  We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.56 utt2: yeah,  /
sv          B.56 utt3: we're pretty, pretty  fortunate as far as [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] budgeting is concerned, because, {D you know, } we don't  have any long term debt.  /
sd          B.56 utt4: {D You know, } {F uh, } we paid cash for car.  /
sd          B.56 utt5:  {D Well, } we bought the car on time, one of them,  /
sd          B.56 utt6: {C but } [ we, +  {D you know, } we ] since paid it off. /  

ba          A.57 utt1:  {D Well } that's pretty. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  The land is paid for cash,  /
sd          B.58 utt2:  {C so } we don't have to worry about that. /  

ba          A.59 utt1:  That's a great position to be in. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {D Well, } it's fraught with other problems <laughter>. /
