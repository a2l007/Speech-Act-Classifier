sv          B.47 utt1:  <Throat_clearing> I think the other  problem is, {D you know, } [ it, + it's ] easy to complain about taxes because there's something you,  theoretically, can do something about. /

sd          A.58 utt2:  That's a decision,  /
sv          A.58 utt3: I think it's a dumb decision on our  part because countries like  Canada and England and Germany do perfectly  well with a, {F uh, } two tract system in which religious schools coexist with  secular schools [ f-, +  with ] the same tax money.  /
