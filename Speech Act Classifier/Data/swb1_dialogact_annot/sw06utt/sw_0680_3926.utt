o          A.1 utt1:  That's it. /  

o          B.2 utt1:  Yes. /  

qw          @A.3 utt1:  What do you think are possible  changes in the, {F uh, } way trials are conducted these days?  /
qy          @A.3 utt2: Do you like  the way some people in there for instance, really take over  and, {F uh, } we have no  way, {F uh, } of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth. /  

ny          B.4 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

qo          A.5 utt1:  # What # do you think about these things? /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {D Well, } as I look at our trial  systems,  /
sv          B.6 utt2: I think they've gotten to be quite a joke.  The way the people can appeal and  file for mistrials  /
sv          B.6 utt3: {C and } they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make  it be a fair system and used it to their advantage.  /
sv          B.6 utt4:  I think that a jury  should listen to the courts, {F uh, } [ to, +  to ] the hearings and to everything,  /
sv          B.6 utt5:  {C but } I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision.  /
sv          B.6 utt6: I think the judge  should hold [ the, + ] {E or } maybe even forty-nine,  /
sv          B.6 utt7: {C and } the judge should be  able to rule one way or the other. /  

bf          A.7 utt1:  [ Y-, +  {D so } you're ] saying  [ yo-, +  you ] think the judge should actually have the final say? /  

sv          B.8 utt1:  I think he should. /  

x          A.9 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C And } I think that there should  be more than one judge.  /
sv          B.10 utt2: There should be maybe two, at least --   

%          A.11 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- that sit in and listen so that  there's no way that you could have like a crooked judge.  /
qy          B.12 utt2: Do you know what I mean? /  

ny          A.13 utt1:  Yes.  /
sd^e          A.13 utt2: I know what you mean. /  

sv          B.14 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } I think that [ there, + ]  it's important to have a jury, but I think the way that they go through so much time to get  it a fair one.  /
sv          B.14 utt2: That's okay too.  /
sv          B.14 utt3: As long as it's not used to delay the trial so  much.  /
sv          B.14 utt4: They need to have a fair jury  /
sv          B.14 utt5: {C but } they only [ w-, + {D you know, }   would ] cover [ fif-, +  forty-nine ] percent of the decision or fifty percent  /
sv          B.14 utt6: {C and then } the two  judges would go ahead and make the final decision. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  <Lipsmack>  {D Well, }   

qo          B.16 utt1:  How do you feel about that? /  

+          A.17 utt1:  I hadn't, {F uh, } thought of it from  that point of view before.  /
sd          A.17 utt2: I have been in a fairly important trial,  /
sv          A.17 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, }  what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury  to adequately understand --   

b          B.18 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  -- what was being presented  so  that they themselves could make a proper and, {F uh, } accurate decision.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:   That's the part that bothered me about it.  /
sv          A.19 utt3: {F Um, } I really think that [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the ]  jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether  they are guilty or not.  /
sv          A.19 utt4: {C But } I also think that the jury should be, {F uh, }   [ very, very, {F uh, } carefully, +  more carefully ] selected to make sure that they  are entirely [ intel-, +  intelligent ] people and that they understand some of  the details that are involved so that they can make [ accu-, +  accurate ] decisions. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  I hate to see people brought in who  basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff,  /
sv          A.21 utt2:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress  she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  # Right. # /  

sv          A.23 utt1:  # That's # no way to make a decision  on some terrible problem. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right.  /
qw          B.24 utt2:  {D Well, } what if they used,  {D you know, } - /
sd          B.24 utt3: I just had a thought come as you were talking.  /
qw          B.24 utt4:  What if they used law students   and had that be credit hours to sit in trials? /  

sv          A.25 utt1:  That would be certainly nice  /
ad          A.25 utt2:  [ sh-, + ] let's say  /
sd          A.25 utt3: [ we, +  we ] would have fifty percent of them law students,   

aa          B.26 utt1:  # Yeah,  /
aap         B.26 utt2: at least. # /  

+          A.27 utt1:  #  (( anyway )) . #   

bf          B.28 utt1:  # At least, #   

+          A.29 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

+          B.30 utt1:  on the jury. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:   # Yeah. # /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  # {C And } that # would give them,    

b          A.33 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.34 utt1:  # experience # in the courtroom,  /
sv          B.34 utt2:  {C and } it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major. /  

sv          A.35 utt1:  That's a very neat idea,  /
sv          A.35 utt2:  {C and } they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life --    

b          B.36 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- when they see what it is like  to be in the jury side of a trial. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  That's right.  /
sv          B.38 utt2:   That would be a really good thing to do. /  

sv^m          A.39 utt1:  That would be [ a, +  a ] really good thing to do. /  

x          B.40 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          A.41 utt1:  {C So } it's <laughter>, -/  

sd          B.42 utt1:  I have a girlfriend that just  went through a three year trial, /  

%          A.43 utt1:  # {F Huh. } # /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  # {C and } # what happened was her  husband was, {F uh, } involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight  /
sd          B.44 utt2:  {C and } he ran into the motorcycle. /  

%          A.45 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C But } [ the reason, +  the actual reason ]  that [ the motorcycle person, +  her husband, ] was killed was because his brakes went out  on his motorcycle.  /
sd          B.46 utt2:  He was just taking it home from the place.  /
sd          B.46 utt3:  It was brand new,  /
sd          B.46 utt4:  {C and } his brakes did not work. /  

ba          A.47 utt1:  For goodness sakes. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {C And } this expensive, big company  that owned these motorcycles, {F um, } railroaded this into three years worth  of trials for this lady  /
sd          B.48 utt2: {C and } she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened -- /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  -- {C and } they were following him  home in the car.  Saw the whole thing happen. /  

qy^d          A.51 utt1:  {F Oh, } they saw the husband,   

na          B.52 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  # get, # -/  

sd          B.54 utt1:  # They # were following him home from the motorcycle shop. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {C And } they railroaded this whole  trial into mistrials, {F um, } this and that {C and } the other.  /
sd          B.56 utt2: Every time she'd get a verdict  that would be in her favor of her,   

b          A.57 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+          B.58 utt1:  # of a # settlement, /  

^2          A.59 utt1:  They would find something wrong with it. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  Until finally they won and,    

qy          A.61 utt1:  # Did they really? # /  

+          B.62 utt1:  # said that # it was the drunk driver's  fault  /
sd@          B.62 utt2: {C and } she would have to sue him. *[[needs slash unit]]   

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+@          B.64 utt1:  Which I would think it would be some  his fault,  /
sv          B.64 utt2: {C but } I just felt like  justice wasn't served because they had the  money, the big lawyers, and she didn't, /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  That is a shame.  /
sv          A.65 utt2:  You'd think there  would be enough, {F uh, } people who saw the accident other than his wife,   

b          B.66 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+          A.67 utt1:  # [ to, +  # to ] also, {F uh, } make  statements,  /
sv          A.67 utt2: {C and } they have nothing to gain one way or the other.  /
sv          A.67 utt3: {C So } if they say a certain  way, then why not believe them. /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.68 utt2:  {C And } I don't know all the  details on that,  /
sv          B.68 utt3: {C but } I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with  [ [ the, +  <lipsmack> the stu-, ] +  the students ] coming into the jury. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.70 utt1:  {C And } I don't think that it would  be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
