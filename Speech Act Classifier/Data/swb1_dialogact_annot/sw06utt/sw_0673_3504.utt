b          A.23 utt1:  Right  /
sv          A.23 utt2: I think they just want to  stay mediocre  and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it  and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.  /

aa          A.33 utt1:  <Laughter> That's true.  /
sd          A.33 utt2:   {C But, } {F uh, } they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him {C and, } {F uh, }  use the money that it would take to sign the guy, {D you know, } to pay for pitchers  {C or, } {D you know, } [ [ [ what it, +  what it, ] +  what they, ] +  what else they ] need.  /

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: it's sure aggravating when  you go out and bust your butt working, {D you know, } your day job and you can work your  day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know. /

%          A.43 utt2: {C but, } -/  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {C But, } one thing I don't understand  is why a group, {D you know, } headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and  not really get behind them  /
sv          B.44 utt2: {C because } I tell you, we need a winner in this town.  /

sv          A.49 utt3: {C but } you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford  to buy [ [ the, +  <noise> the, ] +  the ] players we need. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know.  /
%          B.50 utt2:  It's, -/  

^2          A.51 utt1:  Just real aggravating to <breathing>  /
sd          A.51 utt2:  {C because } I've lived here, {D you know, } since, {D well, } I was born and raised here,  /
sd          A.51 utt3:  {C so } I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,  /
