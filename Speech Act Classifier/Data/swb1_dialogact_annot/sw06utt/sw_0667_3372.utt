sd          B.7 utt3:  {D Well, } see we have the testing already here.  /
sv          B.7 utt4: We've  had it for, {F oh, } about five years. /  

b          A.8 utt1:   Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.9 utt1:   It used to just be for new employees. #  /

sd          B.11 utt2:   They, {F uh, } randomly select employee numbers  /
sd          B.11 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } the day that  they select you is when you have to go [ and, +  and ] be tested. /  

b          A.12 utt1:   # Okay,  /
qo          A.12 utt2: {C and } how do people feel about it? # /  

sd          B.13 utt1:   # {D So, } we're familiar with it. #  /
sd          B.13 utt2:  {F Oh, } we have a lot of, {F um, } people upset about it at the beginning.    Some not all.  /
sd          B.13 utt3: {C But } what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse.    {F Um, } <breathing> mainly the areas [ whe-, +  where ] they were doing  a lot of, {F um, } manufacturing type things  /
sd          B.13 utt4: {C and } what they ended up doing  is, {F uh, } kind of {D like } doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch  what was happening,  /
sd          B.13 utt5: {C and } we had people using on the premises and actually selling and  dealing, {D you know, } on the premises. /  

b          A.14 utt1:   {D Well, } okay,  /
sv          A.14 utt2: [ that's, +  that's ]  a very different issue. /  

b          B.15 utt1:   <Laughter> {D Well, } yeah,  /
sd          B.15 utt2: it was,  {D you know, } combination [ of, +  of,  ] {F uh, } both activities [ and, +  {F uh, } and ]  using too  /
sd          B.15 utt3: {C so } they developed this, {F uh, } drug policy [ so that, +  {F uh, } to ]  eliminate, - /
sd          B.15 utt4: there's some parts of the company that we do, {F uh, } government  contracts,  /
sv          B.15 utt5: {C and } I think some of those require the drug testing,  /
sd(^q)          B.15 utt6:  {C but } now T I thought {D well, } we'll just do it for all employees [ that, + ]  {F um, } not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in  /
^q          B.15 utt7: {C and } that we  shouldn't have, {F um, } people on drugs within our, {D you know, } offices and such. /  

%          A.16 utt1:   # {C And, } # -/  

sd          B.17 utt1:   # I haven't # personally ever been tested,  /
sd          B.17 utt2:  {C but } I don't have a problem with it. /  

qy          A.18 utt1:   {F Um, } does the testing cover  alcohol as well as illegal drugs? /  

nn          B.19 utt1:   No,  /
sv          B.19 utt2: {C but } one thing that  [ to, +  to ] me was, {F um, } going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check,  {F um, } if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.  /
sd          B.19 utt3:  {D You know, } it happens a lot of times  /
sd          B.19 utt4: like some member of the  family gets the flu or whatever  /
sd          B.19 utt5: {C and,  {D you know } --   

%          A.20 utt1:   #  (( {D Well } )) , # -/  

+          B.21 utt1:   -- # then } # they give it to everybody  else in the family and don't always go back to the, {D you know, } doctor and get another prescription.  /
sd          B.21 utt2: {D Well, } according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.  /
sd          B.21 utt3:   [ It, +  {D you know, } it ] can't be in your spouse's name  /
sv          B.21 utt4:  {C so } [ they will look, +  {E I mean, } the testing will look ] for, I guess, any kind of drugs,  /
sd          B.21 utt5:  {C and } you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for. /  

qy          A.22 utt1:   {C So } they ask you to declare  beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking? /  

na          B.23 utt1:   Right.  /
ny          B.23 utt2:  Yes,  /
ny^r          B.23 utt3: yes.  /
sd          B.23 utt4:   When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, {D you know, } everything  [ that, +  that  ] might be there.  /
sd          B.23 utt5:  {C And } then if they ever, {F um, } question you or  something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name. /  

b          A.24 utt1:   Okay.  /
sv          A.24 utt2:  {D Well, } [ it, +   {E I mean, } it's, ] I guess that, in fact, [ they don't test [ for, +  for, ] +  they don't routinely test for ] very many prescription drugs  /
sd          A.24 utt3: [ {C but } that I, +  {C but } they  ]  (( don't say in advance )) , {F uh, } #  /

sv          B.25 utt1:   # {D Well, } # what they [ wo-, +  be ]  testing for are the ones that would have {D like, } {D you know, } barbiturates  or codeine things like that in them. /  

bf          A.26 utt1:   The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or # something  (( anyway )) . # /  

aa          B.27 utt1:   # Right,  /
aa^r          B.27 utt2: right. #  /
sv          B.27 utt3:   I guess that's what [ i-, +  they ] wouldn't be looking for penicillin and [ an-, +  antibiotics  ]  and stuff.  /
sv          B.27 utt4: They would be looking for the, {D yeah, }  controlled things, barbiturates # amphetamines. # /  

bf          A.28 utt1:   # {C So } what they are # asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances. /  

aa          B.29 utt1:   Right,  /
aa^r          B.29 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.29 utt3:  You pretty much,  {D you know, } put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or  something like that.  /
sd          B.29 utt4: {C But } afterwards, {F uh, } maybe if you had a  controlled # substance <laughter>. #   

qy          A.30 utt1:   # Is Contact a, #   

+          B.31 utt1:   {D Well, } # <laughter>, # -/  

+          A.32 utt1:   # Bo-, # -/  

sd          B.33 utt1:   [ you, +  you ] probably put down,  {D you know, } you had  (( Drixoral ))  or  Contact if you would remember that you did it. /  

b          A.34 utt1:   Okay.  /
qy          A.34 utt2: Is Contact a,

+          B.41 utt1:   -- # anything # you have taken.  /
sv          B.41 utt2:   {C But } if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you  then to show that you had that prescription in your name.  /
sd          B.41 utt3:   I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person,    

b          A.42 utt1:   Uh-huh. /
