aa          A.29 utt1:  I think so, too. /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } the buttons  on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products  /
sv          B.30 utt2:  {C and } I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, {F uh, }  imports is they put so much, {D you know, } gadgetry on the dash  /
sv          B.30 utt3: [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]  [ the, +  the ] buttons are so small --

sd          A.47 utt4: what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car  /
sd          A.47 utt5:  {C and } that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  You know a car I ran across recently  that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental. /

sv          A.73 utt6: {C and } [ it, +  it ] handled real well,  /
sd          A.73 utt7: {C but, } my main thing  is space,  /
