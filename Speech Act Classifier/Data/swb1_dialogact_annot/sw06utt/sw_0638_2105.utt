o          B.1 utt1:  Real problem the last few days,  one of their, {F uh, } young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this  season,  /
sd          B.1 utt2: it was a catcher. /  

b          A.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.3 utt1:  {C And } they really don't have an  excess of catchers  /
sv          B.3 utt2: {C and } it's really [ kind of, +  kind of ] late [ to, +  {D you know, } to ]  start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have. /  

b          A.4 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.5 utt1:  They're not the highest paying ball team around. /  

aa          A.6 utt1:  {F Oh } no,  /
aa^r          A.6 utt2: no,  /
qy^g          A.6 utt3: they're not, are they. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  {C But } [ [ I, +  {D you know, } I ] would, +   I would ] gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you. /  

ba          A.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } goodness,  /
sd          A.8 utt2: I would too,  /
sd          A.8 utt3:  even the bench warmer, I would. /  

aa          B.9 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.9 utt2: that's right.  /
sd          B.9 utt3:  I really haven't  been an active Ranger fan in several years.  /
sd          B.9 utt4: I used to go, take my son, {D you know, }  /
sd          B.9 utt5:  when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games. /  

b          A.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.11 utt1:  I'll have to admit [ I kind, +  I kind ]  of went more [ to see, +  to see ] the other team a lot of times than I [ did the, +  did the ] Rangers, /  

b          A.12 utt1:  {F Uh, } yeah. /  

sv          B.13 utt1:  {C But, } I think they're doing better. /  

aa          A.14 utt1:  {D Well, } I do to, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.14 utt2: I have boys,  {D you know, } {D like } eight and eleven  /
sd          A.14 utt3: {C and } we go quite often,   

b          B.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          B.15 utt2: I can imagine. /  

+          A.16 utt1:  to watch the Rangers. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid. /  

b          A.18 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          A.18 utt2:  Oh yes,  /
sd          A.18 utt3: we're heavy into that too. /  

sv          B.19 utt1:  I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch. /  

aa          A.20 utt1:  {F Oh, } I do too. /  

b          B.21 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.22 utt1:  {C And } I think, {F uh, } what caught so  many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, {D you know, }  /
%          A.22 utt2: yes. /  

aa          B.23 utt1:  {F Oh } of course,  /
aa^r          B.23 utt2: of course.  /
sd          B.23 utt3:   As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning,  /
sd          B.23 utt4: he just pitched his first, {F uh, }  exhibition game a day or so ago, /  

b          A.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.25 utt1:  {C and } he pitched [ five, +  {F uh, }  {D yeah, }  five ] full innings.  /
sd          B.25 utt2: That was almost unheard of for a pitcher [ to, +   {D you know, } to ] start out that strong. /  

b          A.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b          A.26 utt2: yes,  /
b          A.26 utt3: uh-huh. /  

o          B.27 utt1:   ((   ))  no big deal, {D you know, }  /
o          B.27 utt2:  it's just part of a days work. /

sv          A.30 utt1:  He really is an, {D you know, } - /
sv          A.30 utt2:  as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year. /  

sv          B.31 utt1:  They could do very well,  /
sv          B.31 utt2: they sure could. /  

%          A.32 utt1:  They coul-, because - /
h          A.32 utt2: I don't know  /
sd          A.32 utt3:  {C but } last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of  all the publicity and everything, /  

b          B.33 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.33 utt2: uh-huh,  /
b          B.33 utt3: right. /

sd          B.35 utt3:  {D well } all their players are signed now.  /
sv          B.35 utt4: Some of them are not too happy about it  /

b          A.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.36 utt2: yeah  /
sv          A.36 utt3: at least,   

sv          B.37 utt1:  {D So } that should help. /

sv          A.38 utt2: it sure should. /  

aa          B.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.39 utt2: it should, uh-huh. /

sd          A.40 utt2:  {C and } of course, there's a few more, {D you know, } I think are good ball teams also. /

aa          B.41 utt2: sure. /
