REMARKS:        This tape was not difficult to transcribe by the first 
portion of the tape, except for the areas where there were extended talkovers.
What made it more difficult was the background noise that could be heard on 
the individual portions of Speaker A and B's portions of the tapes.  Also, 
there were some things that Speaker A said, that could not be heard on the 
first portion or on Speaker B's portion of the tape.  These areas have
been noted in the transcript.  Also, Speaker B could not be heard on Speaker 
A's portion of the tape.  However, Speaker A could be heard on Speaker B's 
portion of the tape and the sequence of speech did not match up with the 
first portion of the tape.
