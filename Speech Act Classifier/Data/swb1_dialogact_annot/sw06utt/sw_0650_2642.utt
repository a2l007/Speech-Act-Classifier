REMARKS:  There was an echo on Speaker B on the joint conversation. 
Speaker A was really weak and faint during the joint conversation

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.24 utt1:  {C But } that's probably paying for  things that were still owed from last time, # <laughter>. # /

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv(^q)          A.31 utt1:  {C but } I think it finally sunk in,  {D you know, } because she saw some of the other people  and just {D like } she heard them say,  {D you know, } {D well, } I used a credit card.  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C And } my husband's sister is the world's worst  at, {F oh, } - /

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sd          B.36 utt3:  you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  The only one that [ we, + we ]  have that we kept was the Discover card, /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd(^q)          A.43 utt4: {C and } people say, {D well, } {D you know, } I'm making money by using this  credit card,  /
sv          A.43 utt5: {C but } they don't realize that if they, - /
sd          A.43 utt6: {E I mean, } it only takes one time  for you to use it and not pay the interest,  /
sd          A.43 utt7: {E I mean, } you have to pay the  interest, not pay it right off, /
