o          A.1 utt1:  Okay. /  

sv          B.2 utt1:  Wonderful touch tone telephone there. /  

qw          A.3 utt1:  <Laughter>  {F Uh, } what kind of books  do you enjoy reading? /  

^h          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ [ haven't, +  have, ] + I have ]  a wide variety [ of, + of ] hobbies,  /
sd          B.4 utt2:  therefore, [ my, + my ] reading pleasures are quite wide.  /
sd          B.4 utt3:   {F Um, } I get a charge out of, {F uh, } TEXAS HIGHWAY,   

b          A.5 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  which is, {F uh, } very colorful,  and, {F uh, } not being a native of Texas, but  being here eleven years have a tendency to,  {F uh, } find out [ the, +  {F uh, } about the ] different areas [ of the co-, +  [ of the, +  of the ]  state ] by reading it. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: I've read that one too.  /
sd          A.7 utt3:   I only had a subscription once,  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C but } my mother always gave me hers  /
sd          A.7 utt5: {C and } [ I, +  I ]  really enjoyed, {D you know, } all the little things that you find out about Texas. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah,  /
sv          B.8 utt2: [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +   {F uh, } absolutely, it's ] great the way that it's broken out and you can, {F uh, } set up little trips and  day trips and things.  /
sv          B.8 utt3: It's [ pretty, +  pretty ] neat.  <talking> <<background>>  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {F Um, } {F oh, } I like  photography, {F um, } magazines.  /
sd          B.8 utt5:  I don't take a subscription or  anything like that.  /
%          B.8 utt6: {F Um, } things, {F oh, } - /
sd          B.8 utt7: being an engineer in facilities  I do read [ a lot of, +  a lot of, ] {F uh, } building magazines [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] plant engineering  magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines  /
sd          B.8 utt8:  [ {C and, } +    

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.10 utt1:  {C and, } ] {F uh, } kind of strange   because [ I, +  it's ] not unusual to,  {F uh, } see, {F uh, } an engineering manual or something laying  around the house  /
sd          B.10 utt2: {C and then } I'll sit up and read just to refresh, {F uh, } {D you know, }  to keep active on it,  /
%          B.10 utt3: {C but, } {F uh. } -/  

b^r          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

qo          B.12 utt1:  How about yourself? /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } I have an interest  in art,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C so } I, frequently purchase and read, {F uh, } books, mainly on water color because  that's my big interest at the moment. /  

ba          B.14 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F oh, } I guess I like  a variety of things, {F uh, } lots of fiction, {F uh, } type books.  /
sd          A.15 utt2:  {F Uh, } right now I'm occasionally  reading on a book about, {F uh, } the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.17 utt1:  That's fairly interesting. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  I bet that would be, rather interesting.  /
sv          B.18 utt2:  {F Uh, } that's, {F uh, } self improvement,  /
sv          B.18 utt3: [ [ that's, +  that's ] + [ alwa-, + ]  {D well, } that's ] kind of a hobby  /
sv          B.18 utt4: {C but } it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, {F uh. } /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: I don't know that I read  anything strictly labeled self improvement.  /
qo          A.19 utt3: How about you? /  

h          B.20 utt1:  {F Um, } {D well } I hate to, - /
ny          B.20 utt2: yes,  /
sd^e          B.20 utt3: I do <laughter>. /  

x          A.21 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.22 utt1:  [ We, + {F uh, } we ] have these classes we attend, {F uh, } management classes  /
sd          B.22 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they give you books  /
sd          B.22 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ]  the last book, {F uh, } matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl  (( Albrecht )) .  /
sd          B.22 utt4:   It talks about, {F uh, } who the customer is and being customer oriented, {F uh, }  which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv(^q)          B.24 utt1:  {F Uh, } one of it's great slogans  is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so } that's all in self  improvement to stay focused on who the customer is  /
sd          B.26 utt2: {C and } as you probably well know,  all of us are our own customer.  /
sd          B.26 utt3:  Your my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {F Um, } every now and then I'm  loaned a tape I can stick [ in the, + {F uh, } in the ] car cassette set on the way home to make  the drive more enjoyable, talking about, {F uh, } better outlooks on things and  the philosophy [ of, + of ] Pat Hagerty and  these kind of, {F uh, } mind stimulating philosophy type.   

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  Which all, {D you know, } betters yourself. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.31 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.31 utt3: {D well, } {F uh, } maybe  I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.33 utt1:  {E I mean } they are  /
sd          A.33 utt2: {C but } I don't label it as such. /  

qw^d          B.34 utt1:  <Laughter> Like what for example. /  

h          A.35 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't know, {F um, }  /
sd          A.35 utt2:  I, {F uh, } have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, {F uh, }  I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,  /
sd          A.35 utt3:  {C but, } {F uh, } they would be things on {D like } how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.   {D You know } [ ge-, + getting ] [ your, + yourself ] in gear to, {F uh, } sort of pull  yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do.   

b          B.36 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  Convincing you that you need to get on with it. /  

b^r          B.38 utt1:  Sure.  /
qy          B.38 utt2:  How about items like, {F um, }  THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big, - /
%          B.38 utt3: okay. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  {C So } those are self improvements. /  

aa          A.41 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {F Um, } our supervisor, {F uh, }  subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.   

%          A.43 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          B.44 utt1:  By a [ man, +  man ] named Doctor Bittel,  B I T T E L <<spells it out>>  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C and }  it's a very layman's, {F uh, } {F uh, } approach  towards managing different types of people.  /
sd          B.44 utt3: {C And } the very last chapter, {A {C and } I haven't  figured out why that one was last, } is how to manage engineers <laughter>. /  

x          A.45 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.46 utt1:  {C So } [ [ it's, +  it's ver-, ] + it's ]  interesting,  /
sv          B.46 utt2: here again [ it's, +  it's ] casual reading  /
sd          B.46 utt3: {C and } it's not eaten up with a lot of,  {F uh, }  (( mechanical ))  stuff  /
sv          B.46 utt4: {C and } it's really excellent fast reading  /
sv          B.46 utt5: [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ]  as you say [ [ it's, + it's ] + sometimes it's ] difficult [ to, +  to ] know if it's,   {D you know, } - /
sv          B.46 utt6: I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are  self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.47 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  If he casually just walked into it and,  {F uh, } put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested. /  

ar          A.49 utt1:  <Laughter> I don't know,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: I'm not sure  I could take too much of Stephen King.  /
sv          A.49 utt3: That's a [ little, + little ] heavy for me. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah,  /

sv          B.50 utt3: {C and, } of course, they're all  just a little spookier than the movies,  /
sv          B.50 utt4: {C but, } {F uh, }   

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          B.52 utt2: I have a hard time finishing books. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {D Well } I guess I also have been reading,  {F uh, } a lot of things on, {F uh, } quality improvement and that type of thing  because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
