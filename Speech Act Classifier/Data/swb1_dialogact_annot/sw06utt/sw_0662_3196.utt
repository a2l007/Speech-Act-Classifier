sd          A.13 utt5: this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me,  because credit cards are my downfall.  /
sv          A.13 utt6: I just find it so easy [ to, +  to ] charge  something when I don't have the money to pay for it,  /
sd          A.13 utt7: {C and } I'm really trying  to get out of that habit.  /
sv          A.13 utt8:  {C So. }  I think they're kind of dangerous. /  

aa          @B.14 utt1:  I think they are, too.  /
sd          @B.14 utt2:   {C And, } unfortunately, {F um, } [ we use ours in, +  we don't use them ] all the time,  /
sd          @B.14 utt3: {C but } we use them  like at Christmas time,  /
sv          @B.14 utt4:  {C and then } it seems like it takes all year to pay them  off when you use  them like that <laughter>. /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C But, } {F um, } I would love to  just take some scissors and cut them in half. /  

aa          A.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.17 utt2: me too. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  I think sometimes when you look at  the interest that you're paying on them, {F um, } that's what gets to be the really  scary part, {D you know, } if you think, when it comes around to income tax time,  and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,  /
sv          B.18 utt2: you could really get a lot more stuff --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- if you were just able to pay outright for it. /  

aa          A.21 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.21 utt2: that's true,  /
sv          A.21 utt3: that's true.  /
sv          A.21 utt4:   Seems just like our society [ is so, +  {F um, } pushes so ] hard for, you can have it, {D you know, }  and then no interest, no payments for a year, and stuff {D like } this,  /
sv          A.21 utt5:  they're really trying to get you into that situation, because they know they've really got you --   

aa@          B.22 utt1:  That's right.*[[needs slash unit - note punctuation]]   

+          A.23 utt1:  -- then,  /
%          A.23 utt2: {C so. } -/  

+@          B.24 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: all I know is some of my credit  cards, - /
sd          B.24 utt3: {D like, } {F um, }  we have a Sears one,  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C and } we always get a maintenance agreement every year -- /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv(^q)          B.26 utt1:  -- {C and } it's just easier to say,  {D you know, } just put that on my credit card.  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {D Well } that's probably four or five hundred  dollars, {D you know, } that goes on at that point -- /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  -- {C and then } it seems like  takes forever to pay that off. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  <Laughter> It's funny,  that we've  got a Sears card, and we bought a washer and dryer on it, four years ago,   and we still owe.  /
sd          A.29 utt2:  {E I mean, } [ I, +  I ] think like half the amount that they cost in the first place. /  

ba          B.30 utt1:  Wow. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  It's just, {F uh, } {D you know, }  you [ never, +  never ] get it out,  /
sv          A.31 utt2: {C and } now that's real irritating. /  

aa          B.32 utt1:  It sure is.  /
sd          B.32 utt2:  We eventually did, - /
sd          B.32 utt3: one  time we just [ borrowed, + took ] a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,  /
sd          B.32 utt4:  {C and } the interest on the loan was cheaper --   

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.34 utt1:  -- than it was, {D you know, } to just  have that.  /
sd          B.34 utt2: We haven't done it lately.  /
sv          B.34 utt3: We probably need to do it again. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {D Well, } we did, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.35 utt2: one  time, we wanted to buy [ a truck, +  a used truck, ]  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C and so } we went down to the bank,  /
sd(^q)          A.35 utt4:  {C and } they said, Sure we'll give you a personal loan.  /
sd          A.35 utt5: It was only a thousand dollars that we needed --   

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- for the truck.  /
sd(^q)          A.37 utt2:  {C And } they said,  sure that's no problem, but, {D you know, } why don't we consolidate your bills,  /
sd(^q)          A.37 utt3:  {C and } at the time we thought, {F Oh, } that would be great, {D you know, }  we could,  /
^q          A.37 utt4:  {C and } it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them,  /
sd          A.37 utt5: you only have to  write one check a month, not all those.  /
sd          A.37 utt6:  You never miss one or whatever -- /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  -- {C and } we did that,  /
sd          A.39 utt2:  {C but } we didn't realize at the time, until several months later, that [ we, +  we ] were real, - /
sd          A.39 utt3:  {E I mean } this was [ four yea-, +  three years ] ago,  /
sd          A.39 utt4: we were pretty young  /
sd          A.39 utt5: {C and } we were just  kind of {D like, } - /
^q          A.39 utt6: {D well, } I guess that means these credit cards are closed,  /
sd          A.39 utt7:  {C and } we didn't, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.39 utt8: about six months later we realized we could use them,  /
sd          A.39 utt9:  {C and so } we charged them all up again. /  

ba          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

x          B.42 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.43 utt1:  {C So } then we were not only paying  those bills regular like we were before,  but also adding the lower payment for all  of them, <laughter>.  /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C So } we were paying {D like twice. }   /
sd          A.43 utt3: {F Um, } {C so }  we didn't ever make that mistake again, luckily <baby>.  /
sd          A.43 utt4: {C But, } {F uh, } we're definitely  working on not doing that credit thing.  /
sd          A.43 utt5: We just, - /
sv          A.43 utt6: as a matter of fact, [ this, +  it's ]  real interesting the subjects I get.  /
sv          A.43 utt7: They always seem to be so pertinent.  /
sd          A.43 utt8:  {C But } we just discussed this last night at church, talking about debt and things like that.  /
sv          A.43 utt9:  It's [ so, +  so ] alluring, and -- +    

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- {F uh, } so  easy to get,  /
%          A.45 utt2: {F uh, } sometimes, -/  

aa          B.46 utt1:  I know,  /
sd          B.46 utt2: they really encourage you  not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and --   

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- your car. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          A.49 utt2: yeah, /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } if you could  stick to that, {D you know, } we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion <beep> and --   

b          A.51 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  -- everything else. /  

aa          A.53 utt1:  That's true.  /
sd          A.53 utt2: {F Oh, } I just picked  up my daughter  /
sd          A.53 utt3: {C and } she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over. /

t3          A.55 utt2:  What a mess you are.  /
h          A.55 utt3:  {F Oh, } {C so } I don't know, [ if I,  +  if [ I, +  I ] ] just feel kind of. - /
sd          A.55 utt4: My big thing was my husband  really wanted to get rid of our Visa card,  /
sd          A.55 utt5: {C and } I just thought, {D you know, }  if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something, {D you know -- }   

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.57 utt1:  -- and we [ had to, +  had to ]  buy one, then we would really need that,  /
sd(^q)          A.57 utt2: {C and so } he said, Okay we'll keep it,  /
