sd          A.77 utt3: {C and } you would like to, <laughter> feel like  it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without  people all the way around you,

sd          A.85 utt1:   I live right on a main thoroughfare,  /
sd          A.85 utt2: {C  so } when I first moved here I probably did consider that  an invasion of privacy  /
sd          A.85 utt3: {C because } [ it, + at ] first you'd hear a lot of noise,  especially at night --

sd          A.91 utt1:   {C And, } {F uh, } I just close it  out, I guess, because [ I don't, +  I don't ] remember waking up in several  years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, {D you know. } /  

b          B.92 utt1:   Uh-huh.  /
b          B.92 utt2:  Yeah. /

qw          A.97 utt1:   <Laughter>  Let's see.  What else is an invasion? /  

sd          B.98 utt1:   I had an old boyfriend who looked  through my notes one time <laughter>. /
