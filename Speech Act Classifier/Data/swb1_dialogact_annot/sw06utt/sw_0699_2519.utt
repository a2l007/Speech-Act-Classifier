b          B.24 utt1:  {F Um, } {F um. }   

+          A.25 utt1:  where [ you, +  {D you know, } you ]  have to walk, {D you know, } [ that + ] like for every mile you walk and every so many  minutes, [ you get, +  you get ] points,  {D you know, }  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {D and  then } you have to go in once a week  and log your points  /

sd          A.39 utt1:  {D you know, } by the time the final  came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet,   

b          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } no. /

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  {C But, } that was the only time I  have ever been able to {D like } start an exercise program and really stick to it,    

b          B.44 utt1:  {F Um, } {F um. }   

+          A.45 utt1:  because then [ I had to, +  I had to ]  go every week and log in what I had walked, /

sd          B.56 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } I have noticed  too that, {F uh, } when I started [ the exercise, +  {F uh, } not the exercise but the walking program, ]  {F uh, } that I did tone up, {D you know, } like all over, /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C but } it didn't get the upper part of my body, /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ]  what I do, is I bowl.  /

b          A.65 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {F Um, } {C but } I've noticed that  what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor,  so that every time I get up to  bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C and } that way I get the little extra exercise. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  I'm always explaining to people,  I do little things like that, like, {D you know, } take the stairs instead of  [ the, + {F um, } the ] elevator, /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.70 utt1:  {C and, } I do silly things like  that versus [ a, +  a ] regular program that you would have. /

b          B.74 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  {C and, } that is one of the things  that they really stressed doing, {D you know, }  /

b          B.76 utt1:  Yeah  /

sv          A.85 utt2:  {C And, } you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up,   

+@          B.86 utt1:  That's true. /  

+          A.87 utt1:  {D you know, } just gives you  a little more activity  /
