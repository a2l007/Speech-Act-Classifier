o          A.1 utt1:  Okay <static>.  {F Uh, } <breathing>  let me see.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling. /  

b          @B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sd          A.3 utt3:  {F Uh, } although lately I've been, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.3 utt4: a friend of mine  that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit  /
sd          A.3 utt5: {C and } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +   it's, ] {F uh, } <laughter> interesting to watch some of the things that she does  /
sd          A.3 utt6:  {C and then } she's almost had an impact on me, {F uh, } where she doesn't say anything to  me when she comes </noise> to my house {C but } I can kind of tell it bothers her {C so, }   

x          B.4 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.5 utt1:  just unconsciously [ I've, +  I've ]  stopped buying a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, } paper plates and paper cups  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {C and } I don't  do that anymore.  /
sd          A.5 utt3:  I don't know why,  /

sd          A.7 utt2: there really isn't.  /
sd          A.7 utt3:  {F Uh, } <child_talking> I know in my mother's neighborhood  in San Antonio, [ each, +  each ] house has, - /
sd          A.7 utt4: [ they're, +  they're ] given three baskets -- /

sv          A.11 utt3: [ {C And, } +  {C and ] } some of the communities that do, the residents are having  to pay to participate in it.    

b          B.12 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  Which really doesn't make sense. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.14 utt2:  Over here, they, {F uh, } have  several private companies that you can take, {F uh, } recycled,   

x          A.15 utt1:  <Child_talking>.   

+          B.16 utt1:  materials to.  /

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          A.17 utt2: that's good. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  {D So } it's nice to have, {D you know, }  one place that you can take them all to instead of driving # the glass to one place  /
%@          B.18 utt2: {C and, } #  *[[needs slash unit]] 

b          A.19 utt1:  # Yeah,  /

sv          B.22 utt2:  [ {D So } it's, +  {D so } that's ]  nice.  /
sv          B.22 utt3: [ It would be, +  it would be ] really nice if they, {F uh, } came to the house to pick  it up  /
sd          B.22 utt4: {C and } they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,  /
sd          B.22 utt5:  {C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } it didn't go through. /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.23 utt2:  {C But } I heard that most  homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that.   Which, {F uh, } - /
h          A.23 utt3: I don't know,  /
sv          A.23 utt4: it just doesn't make sense to me. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.24 utt2:  I guess [ what they, +  what they ]  were talking about here [ was, +  {F uh, } was ] reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  -- or something, {D you know. } /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so } I guess that's one option. /

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: I guess the problem with  plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,  /
sd          B.36 utt3:  you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } I didn't know that. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah.  /

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {C So } I guess that makes it  easy to recycle  /

x          A.41 utt1:  <Barking>.

sv          B.42 utt2: {D so } that --   

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

b          B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  Just her whole house is <laughter> like wow. /  

sv          B.56 utt1:  I guess that's how it gets passed on.    {D You know, } when one person, # you hear # --
