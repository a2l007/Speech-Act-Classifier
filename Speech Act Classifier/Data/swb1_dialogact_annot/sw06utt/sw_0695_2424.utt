o          A.2 utt1:  Okay.  /
qo          A.2 utt2: {D Well, } {F uh, } what do  you think about taxes,  /
qy          A.2 utt3: do you think we're paying too much? /  

no          B.3 utt1:  Yes and no.  /
sd^e          B.3 utt2: Income tax, no.  /
sv          B.3 utt3:   [ I, +  {F uh, } I ] look at it this way, {F uh, } you've got to pay for the privilege of living here. /  

b          A.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.5 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } being [ a, +  {F uh, } a ]  rec vehicle owner, - /
sd          B.5 utt2: {D well, } in fact, I live in a motor home.  /
sd          B.5 utt3: I'm [ a ful-, + what they call a full ]  timer  /
sd          B.5 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } it burns gas like  crazy.  /
sd          B.5 utt5:  I only get seven miles to the gallon.  /
sv          B.5 utt6:  I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes  /
sd          B.5 utt7:  {C and } they call it, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
qw          B.5 utt8: what's the word they use,  /
sd          B.5 utt9: anyway, [ a, +  a ] luxury tax. /  

b          A.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  They [ ga-, +  add ] it [ on +  on ]  to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor.  /
sv          B.7 utt2:  It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking  /
sd          B.7 utt3:  {C and } I quit smoking.  /
sv          B.7 utt4: {C So, } that doesn't bother me  /
sv          B.7 utt5: {C but } I don't think it's fair. /  

b          A.8 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.9 utt1:  [ It's too, +  {F um, } {F um, } it's ]   attacking just certain people. /  

aa          A.10 utt1:  How true. /  

sv          B.11 utt1:  Even with the gasoline tax. /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.12 utt2:  {D Well, } gasoline, especially,  in this part of the country we all use it all the time, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.12 utt3: [ it's, +   that's ] not what I would consider a luxury. /  

b          B.13 utt1:  No.  /
sv          B.13 utt2: {F Uh, } fifty years ago the  automobile was a luxury  /
sv          B.13 utt3: {C but } it's a necessity today  /
sv          B.13 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } as hard as they  try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground.    

b          A.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.15 utt1:  Or that accomplish what they  set out [ to com-, +  to accomplish. ]  /
qo          B.15 utt2:  What are your feelings on it? /  

sv          A.16 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } [ I, +  I ]  think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it  and how it's being managed and so forth.  /
sv          A.16 utt2: {E I mean, } [ I, +  I ] think there could be  [ a + ] better system  /
sv          A.16 utt3: {C and } we would get more for our money.  /
sv          A.16 utt4:  It's totally out of our hands  /
sv          A.16 utt5:  {C so } [ we don't, +  we can't ] really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and  where it goes  /
%          A.16 utt6: {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

aa          B.17 utt1:  Yeah.  /
aa          B.17 utt2:  [ [ That, +  that's, ] +  that's ]  so true.  /
sv          B.17 utt3: {E I mean, } they say well, you voice your opinion, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } on election day. /  

sv          A.18 utt1:  {C But } not really. /  

aa          B.19 utt1:  No,  /
aa          B.19 utt2: you don't.  /
sv          B.19 utt3: Look what happened  on the last presidential election,  /
^q          B.19 utt4: read my lips. /  

x          A.20 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.21 utt1:  {C And } what happened they turned around and  double crossed us. /  

b          A.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.23 utt1:  {C So, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } you  can't believe what you hear. /  

sv          A.24 utt1:  {D Well, } I think too,  /
sv          A.24 utt2: one of the  things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress  and, {F uh, } that don't seem to have any validity at all.   /
sv          A.24 utt3: {E I mean, } they're  always far out  /
sv          A.24 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they're studying some obscure bug, {D you know, }   

b          B.25 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.26 utt1: in some other part of the world or some such thing, /  

b          B.27 utt1:  {F Uh, } yes. /  

sv          A.28 utt1:  {C and } our tax money pays for those  things  /
sv          A.28 utt2: {C and } I think that's wrong.  /
%          A.28 utt3:  I, -/  

aa          B.29 utt1:  I agree  /
sv          B.29 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ I, +  I ] also think we  extend too much help to other, {F uh, } countries  /
sv          B.29 utt3: we need enough help here in this country. /  

aa          A.30 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.31 utt1:  They're still people starving people  here  /  *[[They're -> There're]]
qh          B.31 utt2: why should we help starving people somewhere else. /  

aa          A.32 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.32 utt2:  {C And } I think here lately  they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble. /  

aa          B.33 utt1:  Absolutely.  /
sv          B.33 utt2: {D Now } I can't wait for,  {F uh, } - /
sv          B.33 utt3: [ I, +  I ] could just picture [ wha-, +  what's ] going to happen here in the not to distant future.  /
sv          B.33 utt4:  We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, {F uh, } eight billion  dollars from Japan for [ [ [ the, +  {F uh, } uh-huh,  the, ] +  the, ] +  the ] big,   

^2          A.34 utt1:  The war. /  

+          B.35 utt1:  war over there in the Mideast. /  

b          A.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.37 utt1:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ]  many billions of dollars here and there and  everything  /
sv          B.37 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } the next thing you know we'll be turning around  just like we did to Poland  /
sv(^q)          B.37 utt3: {C and } {D say, } {D well, } just forget it. /  

b          A.38 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.38 utt2:  {C And } I think that's a mistake. /  

aa          B.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } definitely. /  

sv          A.40 utt1:  Somewhere, {D you know, } we have to  realize that we can't just keep giving it away. /  

sv          B.41 utt1:  {D Well, } another thing now they keep  decontrolling different things.  /
sv          B.41 utt2: First, it was the airlines then it was banks [ and, +   and, ] {F uh, } {F um, } savings association,   

x          A.42 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.43 utt1:  and whatnot. /  

sv          A.44 utt1:  We know what trouble they got into <laughter>. /  

aa          B.45 utt1:  Exactly.   /
sv          B.45 utt2: {C And } the same with  the airlines back in the days when they were, {F uh, } controlled [ and, +  and, ]  {F uh, } Transcontinental or,  {F um, } {F um, } Interstate, {F uh, } Trucking.  /
sv          B.45 utt3:  {E I mean, } as soon as the  federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket. /  

b          A.46 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.47 utt1:  Prices went sky high.  /
sv          B.47 utt2: Then, [ in, +   in ] the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive  /
sv          B.47 utt3: {C and } they cut  each others throats until [ they're, +  they reach ] the point where they're cutting their  own throat.  /
qy^g          B.47 utt4: {C And, } {F uh, } {D well, } of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,  /
sd          B.47 utt5:  [ th-, +  that's ] government controlled.  /
%          B.47 utt6: {C But, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          A.48 utt1:  {D Well, } [ I, +  I ] think another thing  too that, {F um, } I've had a little contacted with, {F uh, }  /
sv(^q)          A.48 utt2: in regard to taxes let's say that,  {F uh, } you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, {D you know, } says,  hey, we're not going to allow that.  /
sv          A.48 utt3: {D Well, } I think they're very unfair in the  amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because [ you, +  you ]  will not only payback that that you wrote off  /
sv          A.48 utt4: {C but } you will at least double that amount  /
%          A.48 utt5: {C and, } -/  

bf          B.49 utt1:  {F Oh, } by the time you get through  with [ the, +  {F uh } --   

ny          A.50 utt1:  Yes.  /
sv          A.50 utt2: {C And } [ that's, +  to me there's ]  something wrong there, {D you know. } /  

+          B.51 utt1:  -- the ] penalties. /  

b          A.52 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.52 utt2:  {E I mean, } I can see paying  the interest and some small penalty  /
sv          A.52 utt3: {C but } they really stick it to you big time. /  

aa          B.53 utt1:  {F Uh, } I agree.  /
sv          B.53 utt2: I think the I R S is,  {F uh, } just too powerful.  /
sv          B.53 utt3:  There should be some sort of a control on it.  /
sv          B.53 utt4:  {C And } they should be a little more humane. /  

aa          A.54 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
aa          A.54 utt2:  Absolutely. /  

sv          B.55 utt1:  {F Uh, } the, {F uh, } typical  bureaucratic, I guess.  [ That's, +  that's ] one of my pet peeves.  /
sv          B.55 utt2: I came up with a brilliant idea  how we could reduce [ the, +  the ] budget. /  

b          A.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.57 utt1:  Very simple.  /
sv          B.57 utt2: Give, {F uh, } {F uh, }  {F uh, } government employees the average number of, {F uh, } holidays as the, {F uh, }   

x          A.58 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.59 utt1:  private industry. /  

b          A.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.61 utt1:  {E I mean, } you think about it now,  /
sv          B.61 utt2:  [ they, +  they ] get about sixteen holidays a year. /  

sv          A.62 utt1:  That's a lot. /  

aa          B.63 utt1:  It sure is.  /
sv          B.63 utt2:  {C And } I think here at  TI we get, what is it nine or ten? /  

sd          A.64 utt1:  {D Well, } I haven't counted.  /
sd          A.64 utt2: [ I, +   I ]  would have guessed eight even  /
sv          A.64 utt3: {C but } you might be right.  /
sv          A.64 utt4: I don't have any idea. /  

sd          B.65 utt1:  {D Well, } I remember, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sv          B.65 utt2:  [ thinking, +  I think ] it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average.  /
sv          B.65 utt3:  Maybe even a  little more, a day or so more than the average. /  

b          A.66 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.67 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } government is ridiculous. /  

ba          A.68 utt1:  Wow. /  

ad          B.69 utt1:  Just think of the money they could save.  /
sd          B.69 utt2:   {E I mean, } [ they're, +  they're ] paying out this money anyway. /  

b          A.70 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qh          B.71 utt1:  Why not get the work out of the people. /  

b          A.72 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.73 utt1:  {C And, } {D well, } anyway that would,  of course, eventually come back to taxes.  /
sv          B.73 utt2: {C But, } {F uh, } as far as income tax is  concerned, I can't complain too much about it.  /
sd          B.73 utt3: {F Uh, } I'm single,  /
sd          B.73 utt4: I have no, {F uh, }  dependents or anything,  /
sd          B.73 utt5: my children are all grown  /
sd          B.73 utt6: {C and } they're out worrying about their own income taxes. /  

b          A.74 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.74 utt2:  {D Well, } [ I, +  I ] have  another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and  you earn interest on whatever your investment is  /
sv          A.74 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, }  we're not typically talking about big dollars  /
sv          A.74 utt4: {C but } here you feel like [ you've, +  you've ]  done something good  /
sv          A.74 utt5: [ you've, +  you've ] earned your interest  /
sv          A.74 utt6: {C and } then you have to go back  and pay taxes on it.  /
sv          A.74 utt7: {C So, } the real amount of your savings on that [ is, +  is, ] not much. /  

aa          B.75 utt1:  {F Uh, } very true.  /
%          B.75 utt2: That's, -/  

sv          A.76 utt1:  {D You know, } it's kind of a vicious circle there. /  

sv          B.77 utt1:  {C And then } they tell you to, {F uh, }  {D well, } invest it in, {F uh, } is it I R A -s or  something  /
sv          B.77 utt2: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]   

sv          A.78 utt1:  {C And then, }   

+          B.79 utt1:  [ when you turn, +    

+          A.80 utt1:  at a took that away as far as being, -/  

+          B.81 utt1:  When you turn ] sixty-five why then  you pay the tax on it  /
sv          B.81 utt2: {C and } the tax is a lot less. /  

b          A.82 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.83 utt1:  {C But } in the mean time you've got  your money tide up in a [ low, + relatively  low ] interest bearing investment.  /
sv          B.83 utt2:  {E I mean, }  it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today. /  

b          A.84 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          B.85 utt1:  {F Uh, } me I'm a firm believer in  that if you got it spend it. /
