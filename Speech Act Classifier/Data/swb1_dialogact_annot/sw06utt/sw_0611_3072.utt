b          B.17 utt1:  Yeah,  /

b          B.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.24 utt1:  Which is up kind of near Denver.

ba          B.27 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's always refreshing to get away from. /  

sd          A.28 utt1:  {C So } it's a lot of fun.  /
sd          A.28 utt2:   I worked up there last summer,  /
sd          A.28 utt3: {C so } I guess it was kind of like a vacation the,

sd          A.32 utt3: {C So } that's probably my  favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation. /  

sd          B.33 utt1:  {D Well, } [ my, +  {F uh, } my ]  middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,  /

b          B.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.40 utt1:  {C And } that's the best place that I've ever canoed. /  

%          B.41 utt1:  {F Huh. } /  

sv          A.42 utt1:  It's really, really pretty.  /

%          A.42 utt3: {C and } we <breathing> to have, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.42 utt4: we stayed at some park  /
sd          A.42 utt5:  {C and } they had <breathing> a little <breathing> {F uh, } mountain man who came down the river every night,  /
sd          A.42 utt6:  {C and } he would give a little talk about <laughter> mountain things.  /
sd          A.42 utt7:   {D You know, } I think he wasn't a real mountain man,  /
sd          A.42 utt8:  {C but } we were pretty convinced he was a full,   

b          B.43 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          A.44 utt1:  hermit who lived up in,   

b          B.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.46 utt1:  the woods, that he'd come in his  little log boat down the river,  /
sd          A.46 utt2: {C and } [ we would have to, + we'd  ((   )) ] - /
sd          A.46 utt3:  {C and } he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found  /
sv          A.46 utt4: {C and, }   

ba          B.47 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's neat. /  

+         A.48 utt1:  That's a good family place to go, /  

b          B.49 utt1:  Sure. /  

sv          A.50 utt1:  {C and then } the river was really  nice because it wasn't too frightening,  /
sv          A.50 utt2: {C but } it wasn't,   

b          B.51 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.52 utt1:  {D you know, } too easy either.  /
sv          A.52 utt2: It was like, -/  

sv          B.53 utt1:  {D Well, } you learn a lot of, {F um, }  skills too,  /
sv          B.53 utt2: {C and } I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills, /  

aa          A.54 utt1:  That's true. /  

sv          B.55 utt1:  {C and } I think [ they really +   <lipsmack> it really ] [ pen-, +  penetrates ] in your memory, {D you know, } what to do,  because you really have a great interest in it.    

b          A.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.57 utt1:  Because it's something you  weren't forced to do <laughter>, /  

b          A.58 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.59 utt1:  {C so } you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning. /  

b         A.60 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.61 utt1:  {C And } you're more receptive. /  

ba          A.62 utt1:  {D Well, } that's good.  /
^h          A.62 utt2: {D Well, }   we, {F um, } let's see, - /
sd          A.62 utt3:  the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, {D you know, } go on  camping trips  up to Texoma and things like  that.  /  

b          B.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         A.64 utt1:  {C And then } I went to England --   

ba          B.65 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's exciting. /  

+          A.66 utt1:  -- a few years ago.  /
sd          A.66 utt2: I was a,   

b          B.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.68 utt1:  student there and spent, {F um, }  a semester studying abroad in London. /  

b^r          B.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.70 utt1:  {C And } that was a great time, because  [ it's +  {D so, } that's ] such a neat place  /
sd          A.70 utt2: {C and } [ it's, + there's ] not a language barrier  /
%          A.70 utt3: {C  so } you don't, - /
sd          A.70 utt4: {E I mean, } [ there + <laughter> there's ] a little bit,  because there's some  of those English words that you just don't <breathing> exactly know  what they mean,  /
sv          A.70 utt5: {C and } a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,  /
sv          A.70 utt6:  {C but } <breathing> [ it's, +  it was ] really fun.  /
sd          A.70 utt7: [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] really enjoyed that.  /
sd          A.70 utt8:   I'm probably going back there to work,   

b          B.71 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.72 utt1:  for a year. /  

sd          B.73 utt1:  {D Well, } I had a friend that, {F uh, }  visited England [ not, + {D well, } I think it's been ] probably two years now,  /
sd          B.73 utt2: {C but } that's her next goal,  {A {C and } she can do it, } is go back to England,  /
sd          B.73 utt3: {C because } she really has  a great desire to do that,  /
sd          B.73 utt4: {C because } the love that she, {F um, } has for it now after visiting it. -/  

sv          A.74 utt1:  [ It, +  it's ] really nice.  /
sd          A.74 utt2:  [ I would, +   I would ] spend all my time in London,   

b          B.75 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.76 utt1:  or most of my time,  /
sd          A.76 utt2:  {C and } [ that's +  <breathing> it was ] really different being in a big city,  /
sd          A.76 utt3: {C because } I don't get much into [ urban, +  {D you know, } really urban ] areas a lot -- /  

b          B.77 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.77 utt2: uh-huh. /  

sd          A.78 utt1:  -- {C and } [ [ it was, +  it's  really, ] +  it's ] sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are  /
sd          A.78 utt2:  {C and } you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,  /
sd          A.78 utt3:  {C but } it ended up being kind of nice <breathing> because you're not accountable to anyone. /  

b          B.79 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.79 utt2: uh-huh. /

b          B.83 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.84 utt1:  I did a lot of just going out by myself  and <breathing> riding on the subway and watching people. /  

b          B.85 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.86 utt1:  {C And } I had a great time doing that.  /
