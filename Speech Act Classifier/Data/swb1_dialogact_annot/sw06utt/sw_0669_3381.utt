b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  -- {E I mean, } they are really in a crisis.  /
sd          B.32 utt2:  There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in  county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {C And } a lot of them they put out  on parole  /

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.37 utt2:  {D Well, } some, I'm just wondering  a lot of times they will put, {F uh, } people, lesser crimes in, {F uh, } with,  {F uh, } people that did more severe crimes  /
sv          A.37 utt3: than [ they, +  maybe they ] just tend to learn  from these people  /
sv          A.37 utt4: [ {C and } they, + {C and } when they ] get back out, they just go into worse crimes. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  I think that could be true too. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  Maybe they should try and separate  them a little bit more.  {F Uh, } /  

sv          B.40 utt1:  I think the whole parole thing,  {D you know, } if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen  years, {D well, } they are out in six or seven.    {D You know, }  (( outbound on ))   the streets again <laughter>. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  {C And } to me that's really scary.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  Some of these crimes that they commit, {D you know, } seems like the punishment is not  really equal to the crime. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          A.43 utt2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I don't  know [ with, +  with ] my limited, <noise> {F uh, } psychology background I do have, [ I don't, +   I don't ] even feel that prisons and  stuff [ are, + are ] the answer.  /
sv          A.43 utt3:   If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, {F uh, } the people when they are kids. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  A lot of this probably just starts [ [ with, +   from the, ] +  from the ] homes.  Also from [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the ] media, the T V -s,  [ the, + ] {F uh, } /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  all these, {F uh, } gory movies on  there becomes, {F uh, } just a natural fact of life. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /

sd          A.51 utt3:  {D well, } they probably won't sensor so  much the sexual stuff as much as the violent. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C And } they have a lot less crime. /
