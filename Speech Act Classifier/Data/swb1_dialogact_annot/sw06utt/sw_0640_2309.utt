=======================================================================
  

o          A.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
qy          A.1 utt2: have you ever served as a juror? /  

ng          @B.2 utt1:  Never.  /
sd^e          @B.2 utt2: I've never been served on  the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  I never have either. /  

%          B.4 utt1:  You haven't, {F huh. }  /
qo          B.4 utt2: If you were,  {F uh, } what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers? /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {D Well, } I think it's a good idea.  /
sv          A.5 utt2:  I think our justice system needs a major overhaul,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: {C and } I'm not sure what needs  to be done to fix it.  /
sv          A.5 utt4: {C But } I think they've got a lot of problems. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  I think the major thing they need to  correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial. /  

aa          A.7 utt1:  True. /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {C And } I don't know if that's just  a pure volumes number [ or, + or ]  what,  /
sv          B.8 utt2: {C but, } {F uh. }  Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant  in the facts of law and how things should be determined,  /
sv          B.8 utt3:  {C and } they're too easily swayed by their emotion. /  

aa          A.9 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.9 utt2: I think that's true. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  Hence is possible error as you  can see in all the IRONSIDES,   

x          A.11 utt1:  <Laughter>   

+          B.12 utt1:  T V shows. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah.  /
qy          A.13 utt2:  [ Do, +  would ] you prefer all trials by a judge? /  

nn          B.14 utt1:  No,  /
sv^e          B.14 utt2: I think there are certain things that,  {F uh, } the jury can determine as far as, {F uh, } guilty or not guilty,  /
sv          B.14 utt3:  {C but } as far as the [ [ af-, +  af-, ] +  affixing ] of punishment and fines and things of that  nature, <throat_clearing> I don't know if that is best left up to the jury [ to de-, +   to award, ] {D you know. }  /
sv          B.14 utt4: Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus  a judge knowing, {D you know, } it's true that, {D you know, } this may be sad and  all that thing,  /
sv          B.14 utt5: {C but, } {F uh, } the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination  of guilt and innocence, but  not the award [ of, +  of ]  penalties and fines and punishment. /  

aa          A.15 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.15 utt2: I would agree with that.  /
sv          A.15 utt3:  I think you're righ-,  /
sv          A.15 utt4: I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances  and make huge settlements thinking {D well } it's only going to  cost the insurance company,  /
%          A.15 utt5: {C and, } -/  

aa          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          B.16 utt2: that's true.  /
sv          B.16 utt3:   {C But, } {F uh, } I do like the idea of the jury being [ the, +  the ] people who decide in the matter of, {F uh, }   if it's a jail term versus life and death --    

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.18 utt1:  -- {D you know, } the death penalty and such. /  

sv          A.19 utt1:  If they give them all the information.  /
h          A.19 utt2:    I don't know,  /
sv          A.19 utt3: when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them  [ if a guy, +  if the person ] has a previous record and stuff. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.21 utt1:  Sometimes it seems like during the  trial part, the jury's [ not, + ] {D you know, } misses some of the best evidence because  they make them leave,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C and } --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- the judge decides whether or not they should hear it. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {F Uh, } [ [ it, +  it, ] +  it's ]  kind of difficult,  /
sv          B.24 utt3: {C and } I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, {F uh, } some guilty  people go free than to put an innocent person [ in, +  in ] jail --   

b          A.25 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.26 utt1:  -- although you still hear about those occasionally. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Yeah.  /
qy          A.27 utt2:  Do you think the verdict  should be completely unanimous by the jury? /  

no          B.28 utt1:  {F Um, } I don't know.  /
sd          B.28 utt2:  [ I, +   {D you know, } I ] heard a very interesting, - /
h          B.28 utt3:  {C and } maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching,  /
sd          B.28 utt4:  they were going through a trial,  /
sv          B.28 utt5: {C and } I think it was {D like } on one of  [ the, +  the ] documentary T V shows where they ask for [ the, +  the ] verdict by the jury -- /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.30 utt1:  -- {C and } they went by each one,  saying guilty or innocent, guilty or  innocent. /  

b^r          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         B.32 utt1:  {C And } they took it more as  just {D like } a majority. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Oh. /  

%          B.34 utt1:  {D So } [ I, +  I, ] -/  

bf          A.35 utt1:  Some of them disagree,  /
bf          A.35 utt2:  {E I mean, } some of them said one way and some the other. /  

aa          B.36 utt1:  Exactly,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: {C but } they took,  {D you know, } whatever the majority was.  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C So } I didn't know if that was just something for drama  or that's truly the way it is.  /
sv          B.36 utt4: I always thought it had to be unanimous. /  

sv          A.37 utt1:  I think it does have to be unanimous. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh. }  Rather interesting. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  I know they can poll a jury,  make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C but } I thought that  they all had to agree  /
sd          A.39 utt3: {C or } else [ they, +  it ] was a hung jury. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.41 utt1:  {C And, } -/  

sd          B.42 utt1:  [ I did, +  I did ] also. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.43 utt2: [ I thi-, + ] I don't know  how I feel about that.  /
sv          A.43 utt3: I think maybe, {F uh, } majority might be sufficient. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

h          A.45 utt1:  It's hard to say though. /  

qy^d          B.46 utt1:  What about in international trials.  /
qy          B.46 utt2:   Do you think they should have a jury there? /  

^h          A.47 utt1:  Oh. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  I think that would be kind of interesting. /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.49 utt2: I hadn't thought about international trials at all. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  I guess [ the, +  the ]  problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts --   

b          A.51 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.52 utt1:  -- like, {D you know, } the old day with the rack.  /
sd(^q)          B.52 utt2:  [ We, +  they're ] going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait  four million dollars.  /
qh          B.52 utt3: {D Well, } whose going to really make them. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  Nobody. /  

b^r          A.55 utt1:  Yeah, /  

sv          B.56 utt1:  [ {C So. } +  {C But } ] I think it  would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, {D you know, } people from different  countries, {F uh, } in as international law also. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.57 utt2: I think maybe they'd need to be  more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street --   

b          B.58 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  -- for something like that  because of the cultural differences.   

b          B.60 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  Things like that. /  

sd          B.62 utt1:  I don't know [ how, +  what ]  it would take to [ be, +  come up ] with a true perfect system, {E or } if one exists.  /
%          B.62 utt2: {C But, } -/  

b          A.63 utt1:  Yeah.  /
o@          A.63 utt2:  What about uniform sentencing?   

qy^h          B.64 utt1:  {F Uh, } is that the crime  /
qy^d          B.64 utt2:  {C and } it's already,  ((   ))  some chart and determine the punishment,  /
%          B.64 utt3: {C or. } -/  

+@          A.65 utt1:  Right.  /
ny          A.65 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          A.65 utt3: {D like } if you're  convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years.  /
sd          A.65 utt4:  It's not a discretionary thing. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.66 utt2:  I think there should be a  core minimum that they get -- /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.68 utt1:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } I guess there  should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can  either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature.  /
%          B.68 utt2: {C But, } -/  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.69 utt2:  I wish that when they sentence  someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years. /  

aa          B.70 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.70 utt2: that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.70 utt3: if you  sentence  someone to life, life is only forty-nine  years, something like that. /  

b          A.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.71 utt2: I, -/  

sv          B.72 utt1:  {C And } I guess you're eligible after  twenty-seven for parole, even though you're in for life. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.73 utt2: {C and } sometimes those people  [ are, +  are ] young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.74 utt2: although I guess it's, [ you, +   you ] want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and  being a drain all the time. /  

b          A.75 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.75 utt2: I don't believe that very often happens. /  

aa          B.76 utt1:  No.  /
sv          B.76 utt2:  {C Because } {F uh, } inside  the jail [ there, +  I don't think there's ] no real rehabilitation. /  

aa          A.77 utt1:  I don't think so either.  /
sv          A.77 utt2: In fact,  I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah,  /
bf          B.78 utt2: it's another war zone. /  

aa          A.79 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qh          B.80 utt1:  {C But, } who knows. /  

sv          A.81 utt1:  [ I think, +  I think ] maybe they ought  to just be punished with [ some, + some ] kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a  shorter length of time, {D you know. } /  

aa          B.82 utt1:  I agree,  /
sv          B.82 utt2: get them out there, /  

sv          A.83 utt1:  Actually make them do something that's  not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, {D you know, }  world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences  of the other ones rub off on them,  /
%          A.83 utt2: {C and, } -/  

aa          B.84 utt1:  Sure,  /
sv          B.84 utt2: they should have them go out  and doing stuff.   

b          A.85 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.86 utt1:  Cleaning up, or picking up dirt,  or weeds, or who knows what.  Something [ for the, +  for the ] state,  /
sv          B.86 utt2: since the  state is paying for them, they should get some [ kind of, +  kind of ] work out of them. /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.87 utt2:  Something besides license plates  and tiddlywinks. /  

aa          B.88 utt1:  Exactly. /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.90 utt1:  Trading their lives for cigarettes --   

b^r          A.91 utt1:  Yeah. /
