fp          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } hi.  /
sd          A.1 utt2:  I guess, {F uh, } I'll  just start by saying that we entertain with, {F uh, } a gourmet club here.  {F Um, } which  means that we have {D like } [ eight, +  eight ] people, four couples. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  {C And } most of the husbands, - /
sv          A.3 utt2: this is  really peculiar,  /
sd          A.3 utt3: most of the husbands cook. /  

ba          B.4 utt1:  Great. /  

sv          A.5 utt1:  {E I mean, } the wives during the day,  {D you know, } get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day. /  

x          B.6 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.7 utt1:  {F Um, } {D you know } they don't really  care about gourmet stuff,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C but } it was the guys that got together and did all this. /  

ba          B.8 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } {D like } my husband just,  he really, really likes to cook in terms of, {F um, } {F oh, } barbecue,  /
sv          A.9 utt2: {C and }  {E I mean } all guys, I think, like to barbecue.  /
sv          A.9 utt3:  I think it's caveman, /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          B.10 utt2: right. /  

o          A.11 utt1:  I'm telling you,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: {C but, } {F um, }  he really does cook  /
sv          A.11 utt3: {C and } it's a good thing because, {D you know, } [ you can't, + you can't ] knock that. /  

aa          B.12 utt1:  No. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C But } all these other guys do too,  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  {C and so } we've gotten together  /
sd          A.13 utt3: {C and } we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals. /  

x          B.14 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.15 utt1:  {C And } it's really, really kind of  a neat thing to do.  /
%          A.15 utt2: You, -/  

qw          B.16 utt1:  How often do you meet? /  

%          A.17 utt1:  {D Well, } we try,  /
^h          A.17 utt2: {E I mean, } {C because }  {D you know } everybody is so active with their kids and all that.  /
sd          A.17 utt3:  It's like, {D you know, }  if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well <laughter>. /  

b          B.18 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes,  /
b^r          B.18 utt2: yes. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  {C So, } {E I mean } we originally  started out, {D you know, } when we were younger <laughter> --   

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  -- and didn't have so much stuff going  on with the kids.  {F Um, }  /
sd          A.21 utt2: then [ we would, +  we tried to ] do it every other month, /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C but } lately it's just been once  every six months <laughter>. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Oh.  /
sv          B.24 utt2: {D Well, } that's much more reasonable.  /
sd          B.24 utt3:   I was involved in [ a, +  a ] club [ [ like  that for, + {F um, } that, ] + {D you know, } where ]  we tried to really do gourmet, {F uh, } meals. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ we, +  we ]  were a little bit too frequent I think. /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  I don't remember if we were once a month  /
sv          B.28 utt2: {C or } {D anyway } [ it was, +  it was ] difficult.  /
sd          B.28 utt3: By the time we went around it was,  {F uh, } four couples  /
sd          B.28 utt4: {C so, } {F uh, } by the time we got around, {F uh, } to each of us  and it was time again, we were almost tired, {D you know. }    

b          A.29 utt1:  Really,  /
b^r          A.29 utt2: really <laughter>. /  

+          B.30 utt1:  {F Um, } partly because, {F um, }  [ wh-, + ] gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining.  /
sv          B.30 utt2:  It's too rich. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:  {F Oh, } it is absolutely. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  {C And, so, } [ i-, + ] we found that  while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day. /  

b          A.33 utt1:  Yeah <laughter>. /  

%          B.34 utt1:  {F Um, } {C so, } {F uh, } [ we, +  we ]  kind of, - /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C and then } one of the couples,  {F uh, } moved  /
sd          B.34 utt3: {C and so }  we sort of [ didn't, +  didn't ] continue it,  /
sd          B.34 utt4:  [ {C but, } +  {F um, } {C and } ] I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time,  then [ you, +  you ] don't have as much time for, {F uh, } regular entertaining,  /
sd          B.34 utt5:  {C but, } {F um, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ when, +  when ] we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, <lipsmack> {F um, } <breathing> kind of [ h-, +  good ] for everybody  /
sd          B.34 utt6: {C and } [ that's, +    

b          A.35 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  that sometimes means ] you can't do gourmet,   

b          A.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.38 utt1:  because depending on who your guests are. /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  {D Well, } yeah, <laughter>  /
sv          A.39 utt2: that's true.  /
sd          A.39 utt3:  {C And } we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish  /
sd          A.39 utt4: {C so } {E I mean } he can get within, -/  

b          B.40 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {D well, } one of my  friends doesn't eat any cheese at all. /  

ba          A.41 utt1:  {F Oh, } my. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C so } that's a real problem  because so many dishes require cheese. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Uh, } {D well, } I take that back.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {F Uh, }  she can't eat some cream cheese.  /
sv          B.44 utt3: {C But } [ that, + that ]  really limits, /  

aa          A.45 utt1:  It sure d-, -/  

%          B.46 utt1:  {F um, } /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  it makes you, {F uh, } keep looking  for recipes every time you have an eye out,   

b          B.48 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  for something like, -/  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

b^m          A.51 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          A.51 utt2:  {C So } [ we, +  we ] try to  keep all that in mind,  /
%          A.51 utt3: {C but } otherwise, {F um, } I guess, {D you know, } entertaining, {F um, } - /
sd          A.51 utt4: [ I, +  I ]  guess I have recipes  /
%          A.51 utt5: I, {F um, } - /
sd          A.51 utt6: {C but } [ that's, +  that's ] basically what we do is the gourmet, /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {C so, } {D you know, } they would be pretty elaborate. /  

b         B.54 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  {F Um, } {C but } it's fun.  /
sd          A.55 utt2:   {E I mean } it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff, /  

ba          B.56 utt1:  {F Oh, } wow. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  {C and, }   

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  {D you know, } you get all prepared  /
sv          A.59 utt2:  {C but } you're right.  /
sv          A.59 utt3: It's very, very rich  /
sd          A.59 utt4: {C and } I'm glad <laughter> we don't have it every, -/  

x          B.60 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          A.61 utt1:  {C because } [ it is, +  it's ] [ a, +   quite a ] treat  /

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          A.71 utt2: I don't think you have to be, {D you know, } more than hamburgers and hot dogs out,
