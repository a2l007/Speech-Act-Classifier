sv          @B.2 utt1:  I think in some professions it's, {F uh, } essential.   Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly. /  

aa          A.3 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.3 utt2:  [ We've, + we ] got a lot of mistakes  here, {F uh, } in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, {F uh, } train conductors --
