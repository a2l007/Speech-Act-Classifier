sv          B.2 utt2: It's kind of a tricky question, because I think [ it's, + it's ] a practical system, /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.4 utt1:  obviously, if it's all compatible and it, {D you know, }  tens - /

sv          B.4 utt3: {F Um, } [ it's, + it's ] a switch.  /
sv          B.4 utt4:   The problem would just be the switch over. /

sv          A.11 utt2: {C so, } {D you know, } [ what, + what ]  I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, [ and then, + and then ]  start phasing things out  /
%          A.11 utt3: {C so, } -/  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {C So } I think that's what they did at first,   

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.14 utt1:  was that they had metric  /
sd          B.14 utt2: [ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] +  {E I mean, } {C and } ]  there's things that we've gone metric.  /

sd          A.17 utt2:   You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  [ So that, + {D you know, } so that, ]  we have little things that are metric,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C but } no one talks about, {D you know, } {F uh, } - /
sd          B.18 utt3:  you buy nine by twelve frames,  /

b          A.19 utt1:  Right. /

+          A.25 utt1:  {D You know. } /  

sd          B.26 utt1:  fifty-nine kilometers per gallon. /  

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.27 utt2:  [ I would, + I would ] be total loss. /

sv          A.29 utt1:  [ I think, + I think, ] though,  if there were some, {D you know, } sort of government incentive program or something --   

b          B.30 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- people would begin to switch over, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.31 utt2:  {C and } I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed  /
sv          A.31 utt3:  {A and, pardon my expression there, } but, {F uh, }   

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  who would get really, {D you know, }  upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff. /
sv          A.33 utt2:  {C But } I think in the end it  would make life a lot easier for --   

aa          B.34 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.34 utt2: it really would. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  --  (( people ))  coming up. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  [ [ [ It's,  + I, ]  + I, ] + it's, ]   because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, <breathing>  {D you know, } get that in our minds, so that we could ch-, {E I mean } /
sv          B.36 utt2: {C because } I think our generation could make a change. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  It would be difficult,  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {C but } it would not be as  difficult for people, {D say, } fifty years old now who [ are, + have ]  never been exposed to the metric system other than, {D you know, } buying a two liter Coke. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Right. /  

%          B.40 utt1:  That's <breathing>, -/  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {D Well, } what [ I think, + I think ]  the difference between now and then might be, {A this is just a might, }  is we were the first generation that was  ((   ))  in elementary school. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  {C And } if they kept it up, - /
sd          A.43 utt2: {C so } let's say,  imagine they had kept going,  /
sd          A.43 utt3: you'd have, {D you know, } two or three more generations that all  now [ are, + are ] familiar with the metric system. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  Not like could use it  comfortably right now, - /
sd          A.45 utt2: {C but } I could convert, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.45 utt3: I could carry around a little conversion card or something  /
sd          A.45 utt4: {C and, }   

b          B.46 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  I could handle it for a while, [ {C and then, } + {C and then } ]  eventually I'd learn,  /
sv          A.47 utt2: {C and } I think that before, it was [ just, + {D you know, } just ]  a bunch of little kids using it. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.49 utt1:  {C And } now I think there are enough people, - /
sv          A.49 utt2:  {D you know, } sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it,  eventually they'll be able to make the switch,  /
sv(^q)       A.49 utt3: {C and } we're not going to start  going crazy and  yelling and saying,   

x          B.50 utt1:  <Breathing>.

sv(^q)       A.51 utt2:  We'll say {F oh, } it's a pain in the neck,  /
^q          A.51 utt3: {C but } it's for the better  /
sv          A.51 utt4: {C and } we'll sort of  deal with it, I think. /  

aa          B.52 utt1:  That's true.  /
sv          B.52 utt2: That makes sense. /  

h          A.53 utt1:  I don't know.  /
sd          A.53 utt2:  [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  would hope it would, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.53 utt3: it seems like it's a reasonable system.  /
sv          A.53 utt4:  {E I mean, } everything seems to be  based on the same thing. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {D Well, } I was trying to think of what kind of  things you'd have to change,  /
sd          B.54 utt2: {C and } you'd have to change your height on your driver's license. /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Right <breathing>. /  

sd           B.56 utt1:  When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, {F uh, }  you'd be <breathing> a hundred and seventy centimeters, /  

b^m          A.57 utt1:  Centimeters. /

b          A.65 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.65 utt2:  {C But } I wonder if that's even  something that, {D you know, } [ they, + they ] have to change immediately.  /
sv          A.65 utt3:  They could just, {D you know, } sort of phase that in,  /

sv          A.65 utt5: {D like }  from now on all licenses would have that,   

b          B.66 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.67 utt1:  rather than going back and changing everything, {D you know, }  all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something. /  

sv          B.68 utt1:  {C And } they'd have to change that little ruler  that's on the door of the seven eleven that,
