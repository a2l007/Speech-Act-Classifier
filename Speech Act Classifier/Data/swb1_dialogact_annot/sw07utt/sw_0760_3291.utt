sd^t          A.1 utt1:  Okay, we're being recorded. /  

aa          B.2 utt1:  All right, Ron. /  

sd          @A.3 utt1:  {F Uh, } number one, I am one hundred percent for  total gun [ t-, + ] control.  /
%          @A.3 utt2: I, -/  

b^m          B.4 utt1:  Total gun control. /  

aa          A.5 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: I am not a member of the National Rifle Association  /
sd          A.5 utt3:  {C and, }   

x          B.6 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          A.7 utt1:  I don't believe in hunting,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I just have  had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate  /
sv          A.7 utt3: {C and } I really feel that we  have to do something in order [ to, + {F uh, } to ] (( )) , -/  

aa          B.8 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd          B.8 utt2: [ I, + I ] agree something should be  done,  /
sv          B.8 utt3:  {C but } [ I, + [ there, + ] I ] don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons,  because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct <lipsmack>  will have access to weapons from somewhere  /


sv          B.8 utt4: {C and } that means they'll  always have an advantage over us  /
sv          B.8 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } they may even get worse because  they know we have nothing to support myself.   /
sd          B.8 utt6: Now, {D you know, } [ I, + I ] agree with a  lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally I used to be a  great hunter  /
sd(^q)       B.8 utt7: {C and } in the last few years I've said, no way.  /
sd          B.8 utt8:  Matter of fact, if I find [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a ] fly running around in the house, I pick him up and  carry him outdoors <laughter>.  /
sd          B.8 utt9:  [ I, + I ] don't even hit him with a flyswatter,  /
sd          B.8 utt10:  {C so } I've, {F uh, } gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting [ and, + and ]  killing and that sort of thing. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  {C But } [ I, + I ] think [ that, + {F uh, } personally, that ]  we do need some weapons available to most of the people.  /
sv          B.10 utt2: Most of the people really are, {F uh, }  honest and, {F uh, } worthy of carrying on their lives properly.  /
sd          B.10 utt3:  {F Uh, }  I'm sort of in line thinking in terms, - /
sv          B.10 utt4: I don't see anything wrong with this five  day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon.  /
sv          B.10 utt5: {E I mean } there's nothing wrong  with that.  /
qy          B.10 utt6:  Do you see anything wrong with that? /  

nn          A.11 utt1:  No,  /
sd^e          A.11 utt2: there's only one problem I have with the whole  thing though, [ th-, + ] is, {D you know, } when they do it, I think our biggest problem  is, {D yes, } [ the, + the ] crooks and what have you are going to get weapons  if the weapons are available. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.13 utt1:  I think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available.   {C And } the types of the weapons.  /
sd          A.13 utt2:  {E I mean } there is --   

b          B.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  -- no, -/  

sd           B.16 utt1:  [ I'm again-, +  I'm against ]  this, {F uh, } automatic and # semiautomatic stuff. # /

aa          A.17 utt1:  # Right,  /
sv          A.17 utt2: [ there is, + #   

sv          B.18 utt1:  I don't think we should have access to those. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  There is ] no reason for it.  {E I mean, } /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  No. /  

sd(^q)@        A.21 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } when people say, {D you know, }  {D well, } my God, [ they're, + they're ] cutting into my civil liberties and all this, {D no, } [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ]  take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are  so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. / *[[separated into an additional slash unit before {D no,}?]]

b          B.22 utt1:  Huh <<faint>>. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } maybe I'm a little bit strong when  I said total gun [ t-, + ] control.  /
sd          A.23 utt2: [ That's, + that's ] really not what I meant.  /
sv          A.23 utt3:  {C But, }  {E I mean } we need control.  /
sv          A.23 utt4: We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening  /
sv          A.23 utt5: {C and }   we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out [ [ in the, + in the ] + --   

b          B.24 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          A.25 utt1:  -- in the ] public. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {C And } [ the, + the ] people should be, {F uh, }  selected so that we know that they are all right and that [ they're, + they're ] not, {F uh, }  acquiring weapons for illicit use.  /
sv          B.26 utt2: {F Uh, } that is not good.  /
sv          B.26 utt3: There's nothing wrong with a  person that enjoys the mechanisms.  /
sd          B.26 utt4:  As a matter of fact, {F uh, }  there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who, {F uh, } brought to me a  target from a rifle that he, {F uh, } pretty {D well, } halfway designed  /
sd          B.26 utt5: {C and } [ he, + he ]  put together the, {F uh, } the bullets in it -- /  

b          A.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.28 utt1:  -- {C and } he was showing me that at a hundred yards,  he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards.  /
sv          B.28 utt2:  {D Now, } {D see } from a technical point of view, that is something [ that, +  that ] our military people need to know about. /  

%          A.29 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sv          B.30 utt1:  {C So } there are other interesting, {F uh, }  facets [ in, + in ] guns and weapons. /
sd          B.30 utt2: This is a, {F uh, } bolt action rifle, I think he has.  /
sd          B.30 utt3:   {C And } he has done other things to the way the, {F uh, } barrel sits in [ the, + {F uh, } <lipsmack>  the ] wood part of it.  /
sd          B.30 utt4: {C And, } {F uh, } he designed [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]  bullets themselves  /
sd          B.30 utt5: {C and } he has <breathing> fantastic accuracy. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.32 utt1:  [ Just, + just ] from a technical point of view, that interests me.    Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  <Breathing> Yes.  /
aa          A.33 utt2: All right,  /
sv          A.33 utt3: [ you, + you ]  sound like you're into the technology of it, which is, - /
aa         A.33 utt4: {D yeah, }  I agree.  /
sd          A.33 utt5:   [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] again, [ I'm, + my ] entire family [ are, + they are ] all hunters -- /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } [ they, + they ]  don't appreciate my stand,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {C and } [ [ I + --   

b          B.36 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- I ] have no, + I really have no ]  problem with sports hunters.  /
sd^r          A.37 utt2:  I really don't.  /
sv          A.37 utt3:  It's just <laughter> when they come out and  they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting,  [ I think + <laughter>, I think ] that's totally outrageous.  /
sv          A.37 utt4:  What's happening is  people are losing, - /
sv          A.37 utt5: they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue. /  

b          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.39 utt1:  {C And } [ the issue,   

x          B.40 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          A.41 utt1:  is, + the issue is ] becoming the focus and not what  is actually happening with guns. /
sv          A.41 utt2:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think something will happen. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /
