sd          A.3 utt4:  [ We have, + {D well, } we like ] a lot of gasoline credit cards,   

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  because we like to be able to stop, {D you know, }  when we're traveling and  stuff wherever there's a station,  /
sd          A.5 utt2: {C but } as far as like  MasterCard and Visa, we don't use those too often.  /
qo          A.5 utt3: What about you? /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  <TV> {F Um, } I used to have a ton of gas credit cards,  /

sd          B.6 utt3: {C but } I think I've even let some of them expire.  /
sd          B.6 utt4:   {C But } I was living out of the country for a while  /

sd          B.8 utt3: I have a MasterCard and an American Express now.  /
sd          B.8 utt4:  I got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million <laughter> cards. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C But, } as long as, - /

+          B.14 utt1:  when I have the choice.  /
sd          B.14 utt2: {C And, } {F um, } I used to  even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff.  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  The stores around here don't let  you do it too much. /  

bh          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {C And so } I don't.  /

sd          B.16 utt3: {C and } there you pay for everything by credit card, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {C but } it's not really a credit card <baby_crying>. /

sd          B.22 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } just, {D you know, } [ it's sha-, + ] many times <baby> you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay  with cash.  /
t3          B.22 utt2: <<Talks to person in background>> # Bye,  /
t3          B.22 utt3: thanks. # /

b          A.25 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  We use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase,  /
sd          A.25 utt3:  {C but } we always have the money set aside already [ to, + ]  /
sd          A.25 utt4: {C and then }  we just pay it off the next,   

b          B.26 utt1:  </TV>  Right,  /

aa          B.28 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.28 utt2: [ I, + I ] never pay finance charges on  them except when I screw up which I occasionally <laughter> do. /

sd          B.30 utt1:  {C And, } {D you know, } I'll forget to pay the  bill by the due date,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: {C or } this last month I mailed a check to them on the twenty-second  /

b          A.33 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {C And } {D you know, }  {C so } I thought I, - /
sd          B.34 utt2: {C and so }  I got hit up with a [ cre-, + ] {F uh, } finance charge on it which pissed me off --   

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  -- because, {F um, } {D you know, }  I really did mail it in time. /

b          A.37 utt2:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {C But } they have no proof of that.  /
sd          B.38 utt2: [  I don't, + I  (( don't ] want to ))  probably talk to them some more discuss it,  /
sd          B.38 utt3: {C but } [ I, + I ]  [ never, + {F um, } usually never ] pay <laughter> finance charges. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  <Laughter> Yeah,  /

sd          A.39 utt6: {C and } they just never did get it,  /
sd          A.39 utt7: {C and } we  had to finally mail them another check. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  I had that hassle one time  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C and } [ I-, + ]  that went on for months and months and  months [ because, + ]  /
sd          B.40 utt3: {C and } they eventually found the  check and deposited it -- /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  -- {C and } months later they were still telling  me that I owed them finance charges and, {F um, } late fees and things like that.  /

b          A.49 utt1:  Yeah. /

sv          B.50 utt3:  it would be ridiculous. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:  <Laughter> Really.  /
sd          A.51 utt2: I like to use my card if I buy  something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state,  {D you know, } where if something is wrong,   

b          B.52 utt1:  Right. /

b          A.57 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {D Well, } that's basically what happened with us  is we bought a computer,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {C and } the computer, {F um, } [ [ d-, + wasn't, ] + didn't ]  do what these people said it would do. /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:   (( We need to just put ))  external cards in  /
sd          B.60 utt2:  {C and } it wouldn't do that  /
sd          B.60 utt3: {C so } he brought it back to them,  /
sd          B.60 utt4: {C and } they're supposed to modify it.  /
sd(^q)       B.60 utt5:   {C And so } I called the credit card company and said, {D well, } we haven't  really taken possession because it's not useful for us.  /
^q          B.60 utt6:  We can't use it. /  

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd(^q)       B.62 utt1:  {C And then } they said, {D well } then don't pay it.  /
sd          B.62 utt2:   {C And then } a month later, I had to dispute it in writing,  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C and } I was out of the country and  got back,  /
sd          B.62 utt4: {C and } I took care of it [ as soo-, + as soon ]  as we got the computer back  /
sd          B.62 utt5: {C and } it was okay.  /
sd          B.62 utt6: I mailed off a check  /
sd          B.62 utt7: {C but then } it was too late.  /
sd          B.62 utt8:  {C So } now they're hitting  (( me up there ))  <laughter> with a finance charge. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Oh <laughter>. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {C But } it's sort of, {D you know, } - /

aa          B.68 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.68 utt2: if I had filed the letter to  dispute it and then paid it eventually, it would have been okay. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.70 utt1: {C So } I learned that for the next time. /

b          B.72 utt1:   (( Yeah. )) /

sd          A.77 utt3: {C and } my husband had always  had that before we got married,  /
sd          A.77 utt4: {C and } those got so high we finally decided  for him and me both to have a card it was {D like } ninety dollars <laughter> or something I think, /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.79 utt1:  I can't remember  /

b          A.85 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  {C but, } {F um, } in the past [ there, + {D you know, } there ]  are some places that only take American Express -- /  

b          A.87 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd         B.88 utt1:  -- {C and then } they don't have the credit limit  because I've over done the credit limit on the other card,  /
