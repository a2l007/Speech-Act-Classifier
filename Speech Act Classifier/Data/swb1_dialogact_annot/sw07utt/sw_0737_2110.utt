============================================================================
  

o          B.1 utt1:  Okay,  /
ad^t          B.1 utt2: {D well, } go ahead,  /
co^t          B.1 utt3: I'll let you start. /  

sd          A.2 utt1:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, {F uh, } be required to do public service for a year or two. /  

b          B.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd        A.4 utt1:  {C And } I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay  home and maybe be wage earners for their family,  /
sd          A.4 utt2: {C or } they had somebody at home  that was ill that they had to tend to.  /
sv          A.4 utt3:  {E I mean, } you can't make it everybody. /  

aa          B.5 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.5 utt2: yeah. /  

sv         A.6 utt1:  {C But } then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off [ and, + and ] maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too. /  

aa          B.7 utt1:  <TV> Uh-huh,  /
sv          B.7 utt2: {C or } it could be like  the draft where, {D you know, } before they draft you, [ they ta-, + ]  {F uh, } you get a physical anyway.  /
sv          B.7 utt3:  {C So } when they send you a draft notice and [ then + ] they give you a  physical - /
sv           B.7 utt4: {C and } if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted.  /
sv          B.7 utt5:   It doesn't matter how rich you are. /  

x          A.8 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

aa          B.9 utt1:  That would be good. /  

sv           A.10 utt1:  {C And then } we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members,  /
^g          A.10 utt2: right. /  

br          B.11 utt1:  What did you say? /  

sv^r       A.12 utt1:  Give physicals to the rest of the family members /
sv          A.12 utt2: {C and } they all had to pass. /  

aa          B.13 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

x          A.14 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          B.15 utt1:  {F Uh. } /  

sv          A.16 utt1:  {F Uh, } I thought it  a good idea too,  though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do  something along this line before they got any money. /  

aa          B.17 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          B.17 utt2: that's true. /  

sv          A.18 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } if they did this, maybe help them out in their college cost  /
sv         A.18 utt2: {C and } maybe they could pay people for doing this, at least something,  /
sv          A.18 utt3: {C so } they [ co-, + could ] subsist. /  

aa          B.19 utt1:  {D Well } that's true.  /
sd           B.19 utt2:   America's paying all this money to have other people give, {F uh, } aid to other countries,  /
sv          B.19 utt3: {C so } they could be  paying their own people and training their own people at the same time. /  

b          A.20 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd         B.21 utt1:  {C Because, } {D actually, } [ when you, + when you ]  do, {F uh, } service overseas you end up learning something, usually [ that's, + that's ]  really useful, plumbing, or  farming, [ or, + or ] something like that,  /
sd          B.21 utt2: {C so } you're really learning a skill </TV>. /  

b          A.22 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.22 utt2: {C and } you know all these old people, they would get out of this right.  /
sd          A.22 utt3: All the ones that are already retired. - /
sv           A.22 utt4: {C So } what we could  do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country. /  

br          B.23 utt1:  <Child> <<in background>> What did you say?  /
%          B.23 utt2:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.24 utt1:  I'm just teasing <laughter>. /  

b          B.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.25 utt2: [ I, + I, ] think, {D well } that's probably the idea,  /
sd          B.25 utt3: I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country, or outside the country. /  

sv          A.26 utt1:  {D Well } I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you  took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries  /
sv         A.26 utt2: {C and } children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off. /  

aa          B.27 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.27 utt2: that would be neat,  /
aa          B.27 utt3: yeah  /

sv^r          B.31 utt2: that'd be sort of neat.  /

%          B.31 utt4:  Course that's what, {F um, } - /
sd          B.31 utt5:  that's sort of like what Truman had,  /
