sd           A.19 utt1:  {C And, } I don't know, then [ we went, + ] we lived in, {F uh, } Madison, Wisconsin for five years, {F um, } for my husband's [ schooling, a-, +  graduate schooling, ]  /

b          B.20 utt1:  Huh.  /
qw          B.20 utt2: {D Well, } what brought you guys down to Texas then? /

sd          A.25 utt3:  {C but, } {F um, } I just don't remember the humidity. /

sd          B.34 utt1:  It seems that progressive, - /

aa          A.35 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv           A.35 utt2: {C and } I think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted.  /
sv          A.35 utt3: I really do think that's part of it. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Huh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {F Um, } {F uh, } [ in, + in ] Wisconsin and Minnesota, when they get winters [ it's, + ] {F um, } [ th-, + ] the winters are bad, but not what you hear about.  /
sv           A.37 utt2:   It's just like down here, [ when you hear, + ] when people here think it's  a hundred and six, people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here. /  

b^m          B.38 utt1:  A hundred and sixty. /

b          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

sd           A.45 utt1:  {F Um, } {C and } it's so dry, that [ it's, + it's ]  like going to Ar-, - /
sd            A.45 utt2: {D well, } probably what [ y-, + ] Arizona used to be like, {D you know, }   

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  it's just dry and cool,  /

sd           B.58 utt1:  {C So, } I'm, {F uh, } quite familiar with how it is  up there,  /
%          B.58 utt2: {C and } if you, - /
sv           B.58 utt3: kind of interesting, {F uh, } the people down here typically  don't think it gets above, {D you know, } fifty degrees <laughter>. /  

aa          A.59 utt1:  <Laughter>  This is very true. /  

sd          B.60 utt1:  {C And } it's always snow, {D you know, }  /
%          B.60 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } -/  

aa          A.61 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          A.61 utt2: right,  /
sd            A.61 utt3: {D well } {D actually, } the summers up there, we thought, were the most beautiful time of the year. /  

aa          B.62 utt1:  {F Oh } yes. /  

sd           A.63 utt1:  {F Um, } in terms of Colorado, I know my husband likes to  camp and backpack and  all the stuff I don't like, {F um, } /  

x          B.64 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          A.65 utt1:  {C but } I'd, - /
sd          A.65 utt2: used to go on, - /
sd          A.65 utt3: I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin  /
sd           A.65 utt4: {C and } I did a lot of business in, {F uh, } {F um, }  [ Colo-, + ] {D well, } Denver,  /
sd            A.65 utt5: {C and } [ that's, + that's ] probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions,   

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.67 utt1:  and then you go into the mountains  /
sd          A.67 utt2: {C and } it's snowy  /
sd            A.67 utt3: {C and } [ col-, + ] {F uh, } it just was a very mixed bag in terms # of Colorado. # /  

aa          B.68 utt1:  # {F Oh } sure. #  /
sd           B.68 utt2:  My parents just live, {F uh, } thirty miles south of Denver  /
sd           B.68 utt3: {C and } it can be sunny [ and, + and ] no problem in Denver  /
sd          B.68 utt4: {C and }  they'll be having snow <throat_clearing>. /  

bh          A.69 utt1:  Isn't that strange? /  

sd           B.70 utt1:  {C So } it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in  just a short distance <throat_clearing>. /  

aa          A.71 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.71 utt2: {C and then } things like torn-, - /
qy           A.71 utt3: are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or  n-, I don't, -/  

na           B.72 utt1:  {F Uh, } it's getting to be more and more of a possibility. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd            B.74 utt1:  It used to be no problem, just because it was such [ a, + a ] rugged terrain and with trees everywhere,  /
sd          B.74 utt2: {C but } now,   

bf          A.75 utt1:  # The mountains,  /

sd           A.77 utt4: in eastern  Ohio and western Pennsylvania, they've even had, I'm going to say, mini tornadoes  for lack of a better word. /  

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           A.79 utt1:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside.  /
sd          A.79 utt2: That was unheard of, {D you know, } twenty years ago. /

sd           A.85 utt3: {C so } I guess one thing we do miss, is that's a smaller town,  /
sd          A.85 utt4: {C and } [ it w-, + it was, ] - /
