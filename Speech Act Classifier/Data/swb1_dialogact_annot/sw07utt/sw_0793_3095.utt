sv          A.57 utt1:  {C And } it seems as though we are, {F uh, }  giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.  /
sv          A.57 utt2:  The victim has been victimized twice,  not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also,

+          A.59 utt1:  the courts that try to do the justice. /

sv          B.66 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's not the idea.  /
sv          B.66 utt2: [ It's, + ] the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime,   

x          A.67 utt1:  <Noise>.   

+@          B.68 utt1:  that he committed, but to punish him for the  crime # he committed. #   *[[ slash error ]]

+@          B.70 utt1:  Yeah. /   *[[slash error]]

sv          A.71 utt1:  To get him out of that, {F uh, } {F uh, }  criminal mind that he has and to direct,

b          A.83 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          B.84 utt1:  Of course it took eighteen months for  [ the thing, + the trial ] to happen. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  {C So, } then, {F uh, }   

x          A.87 utt1:  <Noise>.   

+          B.88 utt1:  there was a letter writing campaign that  went in, <lipsmack>  /

sd          B.88 utt3:   {C And, } {F uh, } fortunately it worked.  /

b          A.91 utt1:  <Talking> <<Faint>> # Yes. #  /

sv          A.93 utt2: they will listen to the voice of the people.  /
sd          A.93 utt3:   I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the  injustices being done, something is going to change. /  

b          B.94 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.95 utt1:  People have to be involved. /

sv          B.112 utt2: It's again the victim gets worse  punishment then the person,   

x          A.113 utt1:  <Talking> <noise>.   

+          B.114 utt1:  that commits the crimes. /
