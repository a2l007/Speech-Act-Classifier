b          B.2 utt1:  Yes. /  

qy          @A.3 utt1:  {D So, } do you use them? /  

ny          B.4 utt1:  {F Uh, } yes,  /
sd^e          B.4 utt2: {F um, } we own one. /  

ba          A.5 utt1:  Terrific.  /
qw          A.5 utt2: What kind? /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {F Uh, } its an Emerson eighty eighty-six, {F um, }  two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.  /
sd          B.6 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, }  [ it's, + it ] comes in mighty handy. /  

qy          A.7 utt1:  Mostly for word processing type things? /  

ny          B.8 utt1:  {F Uh, } yeah,  /
sd^e          B.8 utt2: a big chunk of it's word processing.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:   We're also taking programming classes,  /
sd          B.8 utt4: {C and, } {F uh, } {C so } there's a fair  amount of programming getting done on it.  /

qy          A.9 utt2:  Did you buy a program to handle menus? /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  {F Uh, } it came with a menus program,  /
%          B.10 utt2:  {C but, } {F uh, } that doesn't, - /

ba          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes. /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  -- {C and } hopefully sometime this spring we'll be  able to get one and get it configured. /  

br^m          A.13 utt1:  Eighty eighty-eight is what you said? /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  Eighty eighty-six. /

sv          A.15 utt2: {F oh } gosh, it's worth your time to just  upgrade,  /
sv          A.15 utt3: they're so darned cheap now. /  

qw          B.16 utt1:  Which, -/  

sd          A.17 utt1:  Computers. /

sd          B.20 utt1:  This one went on a credit card,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } we got a way  out, while to pay it off yet.  /
o@          B.20 utt3:  {C So } it's,     *[[ B's next turn is not a continuation of this. ]]

sd          A.21 utt1:  <Laughter>  {F Uh, } [ I've, + I've ]  got one at home too.  /

ba          A.33 utt1:  How nice. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  {D Well, } computer engineering technology, {F uh, }  which, {F uh, } all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.  /
sd          B.34 utt2:   {C But, } I've got a ways to go yet.  /
sd          B.34 utt3:  So far most of what I've done is  getting, [ gotten + ] core classes out of the way, /
sd          B.34 utt4: taken some electronics classes, and  one class [ in, + ] {F um, } with computer logic. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  How they work is fascinating to me. /  

aa          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes.  /
sd          B.36 utt2: I enjoy it myself <laughter>.  /
sd          B.36 utt3:  The, {F uh, } lab for that, {F uh, } computer logic class was a lot of fun. /

ny          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /

aa          B.40 utt1:  Yeah. /  

qo          A.41 utt1:  What do you think of that fuzzy logic? /  

sd           B.42 utt1:  I've not had a chance to work with it,  although, {F um, } my, {F uh, } data structures teacher was telling us something about  how [ fuz-, + fuzzy ] logic works as far as the concept behind it. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {D Now } how you'd implement that software  wise or mechanically I don't know,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } it sounds like a very impressive  [ piece of, + piece of ] work. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: they're pretty amazing.  /

b          B.46 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          A.47 utt1:  -- {C and } it's a fun field. /  

qy          B.48 utt1:  In the fuzzy logic direction? /  

br          A.49 utt1:  What,  /
nn          A.49 utt2: no,  /

sd^e          A.49 utt5:  just regular, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.49 utt6: {C but } you have to take into account, {D you know, } with any computer program all the type  of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- normally don't consider. /

sd^e          B.58 utt2: {D well, } [ what the computer, +  what the C E T ] program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from, - /
sd          B.58 utt3:  you get [ programming, + a fair amount of programming, ]  /
sd          B.58 utt4: you get hardware,  /
sd          B.58 utt5: [ you get, {F uh, } more or  less, + {F uh, } you get ] basic electronics courses that, {F uh, } deal with, {D you know, }  not only the digital circuitry but, {F uh, } {D you know, } power supplies [ and, + and, ]  {F uh, } just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, {F uh, } computer electronics.  /
sd          B.58 utt6:  {C So, } the idea is that, {F um, } you can go in a variety of direction from  C E T major,  /
sd          B.58 utt7: {C but } [ I sa-, + I have ] more  ((   ))  with the hardware than I do with the software,  /
