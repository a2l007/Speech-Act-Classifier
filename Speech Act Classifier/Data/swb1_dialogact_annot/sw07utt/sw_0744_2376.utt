b          A.21 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.22 utt1:  {C so } it really builds up with us. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {C But } [ there is, + {D you know } there is ]  a place you can take those also {D you know } at the same place just put them in a different, {F uh, } container. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } Plano has plans - /
sd          A.25 utt2: I believe it's  tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year,  /

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  certainly would  /
sd          A.31 utt2: {C and } they can separate it  /
sd           A.31 utt3: {C and then } the, {D you know, } trash guys will pick it up.    

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.33 utt1:  Which would really be handy, {D you know, }  for people like shut ins, or,    

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  people who can't or don't drive, {D you know, } /  

bf          B.36 utt1:  {C Or } it just builds up so often, /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  they can't get to the these centers. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv           A.39 utt1:  {C And } I'm sure rather than try to, {F uh, }  ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, {D you know? } /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.40 utt2: yeah. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {C But } I think that's probably a good idea. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  They used to have several places, {F um, }  that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all, /  

b          A.43 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd           B.44 utt1:  # {C and } they # stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable./  

b          A.45 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  {C So } finally, {F um, } [ they, + ]  the people put so much pressure on the city, /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  they did a survey of everybody, /  

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  {C and } they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, {F um, }   

x          A.51 utt1:  <Noise>.   

+          B.52 utt1:  and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town, /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C and } [ [ th-, + they, ] + it ]  just really, - /
sd          B.54 utt2: [ [ e-, + e-, ] + every ]  time you went by there it was just over flowing,/  

aa          A.55 utt1:  # That's right. # /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  # {C and so } Wal-Mart # complained <laughter>, /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          A.57 utt2: yes. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C so } they moved it behind the store  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {C and }  nobody knew where it was, /  

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd           B.60 utt1:  {C and so } people kept piling stuff in the same place,   

b          A.61 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.62 utt1:  where it used to be. /  

ba          A.63 utt1:  Great <laughter>. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {F Oh, } it was just like a dump there, /  

ba          A.65 utt1:  I # bet it was. # /  

sd          B.66 utt1:  # {C and so } finally, # {D you know, }  I called  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C and } [ the-, + they ] said, {D you know, } it was behind there  /
sd          B.66 utt3: {C and } I started taking my things behind there. /  

b          A.67 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {C So } we do that [ with, + ]  because we have milk cartons, {D you know, } constantly,   

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.70 utt1:  with two little kids,   

b          A.71 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.72 utt1:  and the paper,  /
sd          B.72 utt2: {C but } it just builds up, /  

b          A.73 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

sd          B.74 utt1:  # it would be # so nice if they had it,  {D you know } at your home,   

b          A.75 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+           B.76 utt1:  where you could just turn it in so [ they, + they ]  final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area <lipsmack>,   

b          A.77 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.78 utt1:  in one neighborhood, /  

b          A.79 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.80 utt1:  {C and } they have pickup there,  /
sd          B.80 utt2: it's,  {F uh, } I think once or twice a week. /  

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.82 utt1:  {C And } the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out  /
sd          B.82 utt2: {C so } they had not much participation,  /
sd          B.82 utt3: {C and } they were going to cancel it, /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.84 utt1:  {C but } then finally people started getting the message. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.85 utt2:  It's just a matter of education, I think. /  

aa          B.86 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.86 utt2: {C and } I think that, {D you know, } if they can get enough going,   

b          A.87 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.88 utt1:  they'll continue it, {D you know, } throughout the rest of  the city  /
%          B.88 utt2: {C but } it's not, - /
sv          B.88 utt3: I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this, /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.90 utt1:  {C and } it's not going to be, /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Yeah, /  

sv          B.92 utt1:  I don't think <laughter>. /  

aa          A.93 utt1:  yeah,  /
aa          A.93 utt2: that's right. /  

b          B.94 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          A.95 utt1:  I think basically it's a good idea, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.95 utt2:  I hope it works. /  

aa          B.96 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv           B.96 utt2: I do to because it's amazing, how much, {D you know, } trash,   

aa          A.97 utt1:  # Absolutely. # /  

+          B.98 utt1:  # we can generate, # /  

aa^r          A.99 utt1:  absolutely. /  

sd          B.100 utt1:  I know this year we took our Christmas tree - /
sd          B.100 utt2: they had a place,   

b          A.101 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.102 utt1:  in the park where you could go have your tree shredded  /
sd           B.102 utt2: {C and } they gave you a little, {F um, } seedling to plant,   

b          A.103 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.104 utt1:  {D you know } <laughter>, /  

b          A.105 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.106 utt1:  you could take [ the, + the ]  mulch home with you, {D you know, } and take buckets of that home, /  

b          A.107 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.108 utt1:  {C so } that was really good idea, /  

b          A.109 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.110 utt1:  I thought. /  

aa          A.111 utt1:  Absolutely.  /
sd          A.111 utt2: {C And } there's just, {D you know, }  the two of us my wife and I  /
sd          A.111 utt3: {C and } it's amazing how much stuff [ j-, + just ]  the two of us generate, /  

b          B.112 utt1:  Yeah  /
x          B.112 utt2: <noise>.   

sd           A.113 utt1:  {D you know, } I can imagine a family of, {D you know, }  four or five. /  

aa          B.114 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah  /
%          B.114 utt2: it's really, - /
sv          B.114 utt3: it adds up so fast. /  

aa          A.115 utt1:  It really does. /  

b          B.116 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.117 utt1:  As far as new stuff to recycle, {D you know, }  [ I don't really, + I don't really ] know,  /
sd          A.117 utt2: I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth. /  

b          B.118 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.118 utt2:  {D Well, } <lipsmack> they're working on diapers,    

aa          A.119 utt1:  That's right,  /
%          A.119 utt2: I was, -/  

+          B.120 utt1:  which would be great, /  

b          A.121 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.122 utt1:  I've read so many different things about  diapers  /
sd          B.122 utt2: {C and } now their saying that [ e-, + ]  originally they thought the disposables were just awful, /  

b          A.123 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           B.124 utt1:  {C but } now their saying that they're, [ ther-, + ] really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the  water to wash them,    

aa          A.125 utt1:  That's right. /  

+          B.126 utt1:  and, {D you know, } all different kinds of things too,  /
sd          B.126 utt2:  {C so } <lipsmack> [ th-, + the ] diaper service,  trucks - /
sd          B.126 utt3: apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver,   

b          A.127 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.128 utt1:  and drop those off <laughter>. /  

b          A.129 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.130 utt1:  {C So } I don't know what's the, {D you know, }  right thing to do  /
sd          B.130 utt2: {C but } I really would hope that they would come up.  /
sd          B.130 utt3:   I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable <noise>, /  

b          A.131 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.132 utt1:  {C but } the landfill have to do something  special, {D you know, } for those, /  

b          A.133 utt1:  I see. /  

sd          B.134 utt1:  {C but } that just generates a tremendous of #  volume <noise> of trash too,  /

b          B.136 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.137 utt1:  {C but } I'm sure it creates a large amount of, {D you know, }

aa          A.143 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          B.144 utt1:   because you hate to contribute to the problem, /  

aa          A.145 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

sv          B.146 utt1:  {C but } on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either <laughter>. /  

aa          A.147 utt1:  That's right,  /
