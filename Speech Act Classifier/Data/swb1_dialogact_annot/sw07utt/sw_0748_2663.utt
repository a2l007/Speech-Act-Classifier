sd          A.9 utt7: {C and } they said in  general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  They are much more educated than the average corporate president,  /

sd(^q)       A.11 utt3: {C So, } I thought {D well, } maybe. /

sv          A.13 utt9: {C and } Schwartzkopf, {F uh, } {D you know, }  might make a good, {F uh, } politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, {D you know. } /

sv          B.14 utt2: we know he's a good organizer.  /
sd(^q)       B.14 utt3: The question is, {D you know, } can he be the  man who's ultimately responsible.  /
sd(^q)       B.14 utt4:  {D You know, } like what he said  is, {D you know, } a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about, {D you know, }  people asking why are you doing this, why are you doing that.  /
sd(^q)       B.14 utt5:  He says, I'm following the orders of my president.  /
^q          B.14 utt6: I'm not the one who writes the orders.  /

sv          A.15 utt3: everyone has a boss, of course. /  

sd          B.16 utt1:  {D You know, } Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd(^q)       B.18 utt1:  {C And so } he went to the President and said, {D okay, } here's how I want to do it. /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C But } he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait. /

sd^t          A.23 utt1:  I just thought of that one [ when, + when ]  they brought up about politics.  /
sv          A.23 utt2:  That was, {F uh, } pretty easy -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah. /  

ad^t          A.25 utt1:  -- you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican,  /
ad^t          A.25 utt2:  you can pick anything you want,  /
ad          A.25 utt3: go ahead. /  

sd           B.26 utt1:  {D Well, } the thing that I'm <children> wondering about is how we get a new congress.  /

qh          B.26 utt3: how do we get them <<pause>> to not get reelected over and over again. /  

sd           A.27 utt1:  {D Well, } I have an easy answer for that,  {F oh, }  {A I wish they would do it, } is that limit it, {D you know, } to eight or ten years max. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /

aa          B.32 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.32 utt2:  That may be our only answer,  /
sd          B.32 utt3: {C but } I don't really like  it.  /
sd           B.32 utt4:  I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve. /  

ar          A.33 utt1:  {F Oh, } {D you know, } you're not. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat, - /
sv          B.34 utt2:  I think if the President can prove that he's popular, {D you know, }  that he can do the job --   

b          A.35 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  -- then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want.  /
sv          B.36 utt2: I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.  /
sv          B.36 utt3:  {E I mean, } how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year, did they get [ after they  were elected, + [ just, + {D you know, } just ] after ]  they were elected two years ago. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  Basically the people, - /
sv(^q)       B.38 utt2: as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, {D Yeah, }  {D yeah, }   you're my friend,  /
^q          B.38 utt3: you're my friend,  /
sv          B.38 utt4: {C and } two years later he remembers that.  /
sv          B.38 utt5:  {C And } what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Yeah,  /
h          A.39 utt2: I don't know,  /
sd          A.39 utt3: <child_crying> I do like the limitation of the President,  /
sv          A.39 utt4: {C and } I think there is a needed change.  /
sv          A.39 utt5:   I think the same thing should happen for Congress.  /
%          A.39 utt6: [ I, + I'd  ] lik-, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.39 utt7:  that would be my answer of an --   

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.40 utt2: well. -/  

+          A.41 utt1:  -- easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.  /
sv          A.41 utt2: My God, it's ridiculous, {D you know. } /  

sv          B.42 utt1:  [ That's, + that's ] <child_crying> the easy way.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:   I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and  the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground <child_crying>. /  

%          A.43 utt1:  We had. -/  

sv          B.44 utt1:  That's what the financing rules and the, {F uh, } the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff. -/  

sd^t          A.45 utt1:  [ I think voting [ is, + is ] a prob-, + I think ]  I had one of the subject about voting, <child>  and, {F uh, } voting apathy, or  something like that,  /
sv          A.45 utt2: {C and } I think that, {F uh, } the voting rules need to be  changed where you have a little more time.  /
sd          A.45 utt3:  <child squealing>  I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning  til seven o'clock at night, {D you know. } /

b          B.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.49 utt1:  -- then give them a couple of days. /  

sv          B.50 utt1:  {D Well, } I think a lot more people could  vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about. /
