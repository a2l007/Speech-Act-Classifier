REMARKS:        Speaker A seemed to be uninterested or uninformed about the 
topic.  Speaker A frequently talked too fast or the phone line dropped out.  
Both speakers frequently talked at the same time and trailed off at the end 
of a thought.  Sometimes Speaker B talks when Speaker A is trying talk and 
what he is saying can't be determined in the combined tape.
