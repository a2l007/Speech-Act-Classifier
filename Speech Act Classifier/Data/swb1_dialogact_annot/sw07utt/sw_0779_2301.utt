qy          A.1 utt1:  {D So, } do you have any credit cards? /  

ny          @B.2 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          @B.2 utt2: I do.  /
sd          @B.2 utt3:  [ I keep, + {F uh, } I have ]  an American Express, and a Visa card that I keep, {D you know, } kind of for emergency  purposes,  /
sd          @B.2 utt4: {C and } [ I have, + {D you know, } I use ] a gasoline credit card which I, {D you know, } pay off --   

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.4 utt1:  -- [ every, + every ] month. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C But } [ I've, + I've ] gotten rid of all of the  credit cards, {D you know, } that I possibly could,  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } my balances are practically zero  on the ones that I have.  /
sd          B.6 utt3: Especially since, {D you know, } it's no longer after  this year,  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C or } after tax year nineteen ninety, there's no deductions for, {D you know, }  credit card interest that you pay. /  

b          A.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.8 utt1:  {C So } it's a, {D you know, } {D gosh, } - /
sd          B.8 utt2:  credit cards run, {A what, } anywhere from, up to eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.10 utt1:  It's just a bad deal.  /
sv          B.10 utt2:  Course, there are  emergencies, {D you know, } that you, {D you know, } probably need to have a card. /  

aa          A.11 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.11 utt2: I have one card. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sv          B.12 utt2: [ that's, + that's ] probably enough. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {C And } I try not to use it,  /
sd          A.13 utt2: {C but } --   

aa          B.14 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

+          A.15 utt1:  -- right now, it's maxed out <laughter>. /  

sv          B.16 utt1:  [ It's, + it's ] very easy [ to, + {D you know, } to ]  do that or, {D you know, } to abuse it,  /
sv          B.16 utt2: it really is. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          B.18 utt1:  It's so easy to pull out the plastic,  /
sd          B.18 utt2: {C but } we're  trying our best [ not to, + not to ] add any, {D you know, } credit card debt to our structure here. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:  {F Um, } I have, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.19 utt3: the thing that  bothers me worse than the credit cards, I think, is, {F uh, }  you mentioned the gasoline credit card. /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  I don't have that,  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C but } I've got, {D you know, }  one of [ [ the tex-, + the, ] + the ] instant teller cards --   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  -- that you can use for point of sale purchases. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C And } we use that usually to buy gasoline,  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  {C and } [ it's just + --   

b          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  -- it's ] really amazing how quickly that goes. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sv          B.28 utt2:  I'm sure you're right.  /
sd          B.28 utt3: [ [  I don't, + I don't, ] + I don't ] participate in that,  /
sd          B.28 utt4: {C  but, } {D you know, } a lot of folks do. /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: at least with the, {F uh, } <throat_clearing>  gasoline company credit cards you have, {D you know, } up to thirty,  twenty-five, thirty days, {D you know, } interest free for it. /  

b          A.31 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.32 utt1:  {C But, } {D you know, } the instant thing  [ [ may be, + may, ] + may be ]  the way of the future [ to, + {D you know, } to ] replace checks and every other thing. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: that's what [ they've, + they've ] talked about it. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  Course it eliminates any waiting period. /  

aa          B.36 utt1:  It certainly does. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  God help those people who have to float  checks occasionally --   

aa          B.38 utt1:  Absolutely. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- because you won't be able to with that. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  That's right.  /
qy          B.40 utt2:  Do you get any sort of discount  when you use a card like  that? /  

nn          A.41 utt1:  No. /  

bk          B.42 utt1:  I see. /  

%          A.43 utt1:  {F Oh, } it was, {D well, } - /
sd          A.43 utt2:  they consider it to be the same as cash --   

bk          B.44 utt1:  I see,  /
bk^r          B.44 utt2: I see. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- {D well, } cause it actually is. /  

aa          B.46 utt1:  It certainly is,  /
aa          B.46 utt2: yeah. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          A.47 utt2:  It's better than cash <laughter>. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  They don't even have to deposit it,  /
sd          A.49 utt2:  it just goes straight in there. /  

aa          B.50 utt1:  That's right.  /
bf          B.50 utt2: No returned checks or anything. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:  Right. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah.  /
o          B.52 utt2:  No,  /
sd          B.52 utt3: [ I, + I ]  understand it's becoming, {D you know, } the popular thing to do.  /
sd          B.52 utt4: We're not participating in that particular program  at the moment,  /
sd          B.52 utt5: {C and } I don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh  /
x          A.53 utt2: <dishes>.   

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } I have in times past gotten  into a bit of trouble with credit cards./
sv          B.54 utt2: It's just, {D you know, } too easy to do. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C but } I'm so glad he told me  [ [ that  when, + that they, ] + they got ] to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them. /  

aa          B.56 utt1:  That's right. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  They paid them off,  /
sd          A.57 utt2: {C and then } they stuck them in  a thing of water and froze them. /  

x          B.58 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.59 utt1:  She said at least <laughter> before she could use them  she'd have to thaw them out.  /
sv          A.59 utt2:  {E I mean, } that's funny. /  
sv          B.60 utt1:  {D Well, } that's a novel idea.  /
%          B.60 utt2:  Yeah,  /
qh          B.60 utt3: that would cause  you think a little while, wouldn't it. /  

x          A.61 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv          B.62 utt1:  That may not be a bad idea. /  

x          A.63 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.64 utt1:  <Laughter> <dishes>.  {C But } I'm kind of getting a  little more leery of credit cards, {D you know, } as time goes by.  /
sd          B.64 utt2:   Unless you just absolutely have to. - /
sd          B.64 utt3:  {D Now, } there are times when you'd --   

b          A.65 utt1:  Yeah. /
