qo          B.1 utt1:  {D So, } {F uh, } what do you think? <Laughter>. /  

sv          A.2 utt1:  I think we're overtaxed to the hilt. /  

b          B.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.4 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.4 utt2: {E I mean, } [ we're, + we're ]  taxed on taxes  /
sd          A.4 utt3: {C and, } {F um, } {F uh, } most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax  for those who don't have it that is.  /
sd          A.4 utt4: {E I mean } we don't have one yet,  /
sd          A.4 utt5:  {C but } eventually they may try to push it through. /  

b          B.5 utt1:  {F Oh } really.  /
bf          B.5 utt2:  {C So } they have n-, - /
sd          B.5 utt3:   I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas. /  

sd          A.6 utt1:  [ No, +  no ] state income tax. /  

sd          B.7 utt1:  {F Oh, } that's great, because they don't have it in  Florida.  /
sd          B.7 utt2: In New York they have it. /  

b          A.8 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.9 utt1:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } like I say,  I'm in New York  /
sd          B.9 utt2: {C and } we have a state tax as well.  /
sd          B.9 utt3: {C So } that just cuts even more. /  

aa          A.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.10 utt2: I think what needs to be done is they  need to control their spending habits. /  

aa          B.11 utt1:  Right,  /
sv          B.11 utt2: [ I, + I ] think that  I, - /
sd          B.11 utt3: {E I mean, }  I wouldn't be so  upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that [ they don't, + they don't ]  go to any place.  /
sv          B.11 utt4: {D You know, } [ y-, + you ]  don't see it going to any place where it belongs. /  

b          A.12 utt1:  Right. /  

o@            B.13 utt1:  I think [ [ [ if it were to be, + {F uh, } if it were to be, ] +  {F um, } if it were to be, ] + <whispering>  {A [ hold, + hold ]  on a second please, someone just walked in the ro-, } *[[seems to me that the "hold on" should be a separate slash unit (marked 'ad'), and shouldn't continue into B.15]]  

aa          A.14 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+@          B.15 utt1:  <Rattling>  [ If, + if ] it were to be ] spent in the  right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it,  /  *[[see B.13 note]]
sv          B.15 utt2: {C but } given [ that it, + that it's ]  not spent properly, I think it's a major problem. /  

sv          A.16 utt1:  {D Well } we're really overburdened from  federal, state and local,   

b          B.17 utt1:  # Uh-huh  /

+          A.18 utt1:  # that it # takes such a size out of your  paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck. /  

sv          B.19 utt1:  {D Well } that's certainly true.  /
sd           B.19 utt2:  {D Well } what is it  they were just talking about, {F um, } sort of [ middle income, {D you know, } + [ how, + how, ]  middle income ] people, - /
sv          B.19 utt3: what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, {D you know, }  they wind up having kids as a deduction  /
sv          B.19 utt4: [ {C and } after, + ]  {C but } the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it  costs to raise a kid for the year or something. /  

b          A.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          B.21 utt1:  I think tha-, - /

sv          B.21 utt3: [ I think tha-, + I think that ] most of the politicians  understand this.  /
sv          B.21 utt4:  [ They just don't, + they're just not ] very good at doing  what they're supposed to be doing. /  

sv          A.22 utt1:  {D Well } they're kind of put into a trap of  being out there to please the special interest groups as well. /  

b          B.23 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.24 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } I think the only way that  can be changed for us to get [ a, + a ] better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms. /  

b          B.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.26 utt1:  {C And } by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody. /  

aa          B.27 utt1:  I agree,  /
aa^r          B.27 utt2: I agree. /  

sd          A.28 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } I don't know how we're going to  do that right away though,  /
sv          A.28 utt2: {C but, } [ what, + what ] in general though that  taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, {F uh, } a bite out of our savings. /  

aa          B.29 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.29 utt2: exactly,  /
sd          B.29 utt3: [ {C and then, } + {C and then, } ]  {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm ] just not sure [ if I see, + {D you know, } if I see ] it going, {A like I say } to the  right places.  /
sv          B.29 utt4: {E I mean, } [ it'd be, +  it'd be ] one thing if it were taking a bite out of  your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older. /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.31 utt1:  {D You know, } {C but } I'm not  convinced, [ [ that's, + [ a-, + ] tha-, ] + that ] Social Security is doing as well as it should  [ [ [ [ [ [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] +  {C and, } {F uh, } ] +  {C and, } ] + {C and } ] that,  {D you know, } those people who need it for  welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety  percent of them who don't need it.  But {E I mean } the real people who really  need it, {D you know, } should be getting it  /
sv          B.31 utt2: {C but } instead I think it's going to the wrong places. /  

sv          A.32 utt1:  {C And } I believe the Social Security tax is a  great  ((   ))  scheme. /  

qy          B.33 utt1:  You think so? /

sd          A.36 utt2: [ tha-, + that's ] illegal, {D see. }  /
sv          A.36 utt3:   If, {F uh, } most company, {F uh, } C E O -s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail. /

sv          A.44 utt1:  A lot of people have become too  complacent {C and } believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely  helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on,

sd          B.47 utt5: {C and } I wonder if it'll ever be a change process. /  

b          A.48 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.49 utt1:  [ I sort of, + I sort of ] get discouraged when  I think about all the things that I think are wrong <breathing> <laughter>.  /

sv          A.52 utt1:  {D Well } there's no quick solution, or  no sure fire easy answer.  /
sv          A.52 utt2: It's just going to take, {F uh, } {F uh, } really, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  a combination effort, {A I think, } of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer,
