o          A.1 utt1:  <Child> All right. /  

sd          B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } we lived, - /
sd          B.2 utt2:  I grew up in San Antonio,  /
sd          B.2 utt3: {C and } I was used to the heat,  /
sd          B.2 utt4: {C and } I was used to what couldn't grow <laughter>  down there,  /
sd          B.2 utt5: {C and } we had a small, {F um, } farm house out in Castroville which is  just, {F uh, } to the west of San Antonio -- /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  
sd          B.4 utt1: -- {C and } we <<children in background>> did a lot of gardening out there,  and, {F uh, } mostly in raised beds so  we could keep the, {F uh, } soil nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil, very hard [ to, + to ] grow, very hard to cultivate,  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C and } when  we came up, here, {F uh, } to California, {F uh, } we're in the Monterrey area,  /
sd          B.4 utt3: {C and } it's very, {F uh, } nice sandy soil, rich soil,  /
sd          B.4 utt4: {C and } the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow --   

ba          A.5 utt1:  How fine. /  

+          B.6 utt1:  -- so we've been out here, {D well, } really in the  house since December,  /
sd          B.6 utt2: {C and } we've been {F uh, } planting flowers that we could never plant,   

x          A.7 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.8 utt1:  in San Antonio because the heat would just dry  them up after, {D you know, } about three <child> good weeks of nice weather  before the heat started -- /  

b          A.9 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.10 utt1:  -- {C and } here they are supposed to last year around --   

ba          A.11 utt1:  {F Oh } boy. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- so we have some really pretty flowers growing,  /
sd          B.12 utt2:  {C and, } {F uh, } we're at the edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch <child>. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.14 utt1:  <Laughter> Just about anything you would want  in Texas as a gardener is here just around us. /  

x          A.15 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.16 utt1:  We got here at the end of about a four year drought.  /
sd          B.16 utt2:   We've had a whole lot of rain.  /
sd          B.16 utt3: {F Uh, } it's been raining pretty much  continually now, {F uh, } off and on, maybe one day of break, for about a month.  /
%          B.16 utt4: {C So, } -/  

bh          A.17 utt1:  {F Oh } really. /  

ny          B.18 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.18 utt2: we're getting replenished,  /
sd          B.18 utt3: {C and so }  there is, - /
sd          B.18 utt4: when I first came here everything was yellow,  /
sd          B.18 utt5: the grass was dead everywhere.  /
sd          B.18 utt6:   {C And } now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous, lush and green and beautiful, /
sd          B.18 utt7:  {C and } I hope that it holds out here after the summer. /  

ba          A.19 utt1:  Wow. /  

sd          B.20 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh, } that has been the major change  that we have noticed in gardening,  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C and } that's about the extent of what we've done,  just a little bit on the patio, and waiting for the rain to subside so we can <laughter>  mow.  /
sd          B.20 utt3:  [ We, after about a month, + we ] finally got to mow this weekend. /  

x          A.21 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.22 utt1:  {C But, } {F um, } we're just so happy to see green.  /
sd          B.22 utt2:   It's just so nice.  /
sd          B.22 utt3:  We haven't <child> really done too much else other than that. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  {F Um. }  {D Well } we just moved to our first home,  /
sd          A.23 utt2:  {C and } we had lived in a condominium before.  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C So } we didn't have any lawn and  garden type duties.  /
sd          A.23 utt4:  {C So }  we're just learning the ropes here  /
%          A.23 utt5: {C and, } -/  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C But } when we moved in, {F um, } - /
sd          A.25 utt2:  our backyard has so many [ bi-, + ] tall trees in it that [ there jus-, + there wasn't ] even a blade of grass in the backyard. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C So } we're, {D you know, } [ going, + talking ]  to some of our friends that are landscapers and things, and learning about different kinds of  grass.  /
sd          A.27 utt2:  We trying to go, grow grass,  /
sd          A.27 utt3: {C and } it just seems  so funny to me that, when I grew up in Missouri, - /
sd          A.27 utt4: {C and } you didn't have to worry about growing grass  there.  /
sd          A.27 utt5:  It just happened automatically. /  

qy          B.28 utt1:  {C So } do you have to get a shade tolerant grass?  /
qy          B.28 utt2:   Is that what you're, -/  

ny          A.29 utt1:  Yes.  /
sd^e          A.29 utt2: We are.  /
sd          A.29 utt3: [ We tried, + we planted ]  <child> some fescue last, {F um, } fall -- /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  -- {C and } it's really, really pretty,  /
sd@          A.31 utt2:  and, {F um, } <child> green,  / *[[ I think this should be part of the previous slash unit--what follows the conjunction is NOT a clause]]
sd          A.31 utt3: it stayed [ pretty, + pretty ] green throughout the winter,  /
sd          A.31 utt4:  {C and } it's pretty goo-, - /
sd          A.31 utt5: it's not as thick and as nice,  /
sd          A.31 utt6: it doesn't look like  it can withstand too much, {D you know. } /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Oh.  /
qy          B.32 utt2:  Does that last through the summer, too? /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  It's supposed to die off {D like } in August,  /
sd          A.33 utt2: {C and then }  you replant it in September  /
sd          A.33 utt3: {C and, }   

b          B.34 utt1:  Oh. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  {C So, } {C but } we don't, - /
sd          A.35 utt2:  the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't, - /
sd          A.35 utt3: like I say, there really wasn't  even one blade of grass in the backyard. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd(^q)       A.37 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } {C so } mostly, {D you know, }  we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers,   

x          B.38 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          A.39 utt1:  and flower beds or even gardens,  that, we're just saying, let's get some grass <laughter>. /  

bf          B.40 utt1:  Just get grass to grow. /  

^q          A.41 utt1:  Let's get grass so that the kids can play in   the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much.  {D You know. } /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  {D Well, } when we <child> had our house, {F um, }  out in Castroville, the problem with ours is that the, {F uh, }  plots there are a third of an acre </child>.    

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  
+           B.44 utt1:  And <child> trying to keep grass alive during  a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive <laughter>. /  

ba          A.45 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sd          B.46 utt1:  To water it  /
sd          B.46 utt2: [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] eventually,  {D well, } especially  when it was so bad last year, {D well, } I guess it was the year  before now, {F uh, } it was so hot that year,  /
sd          B.46 utt3: that was the year that I think it started out a hundred  in February. /  

ba          A.47 utt1:  {F Oh } no. /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  {F Um, } we were just watering all the time.  /
sd(^q)       B.48 utt2:  Finally what we did was we said, we're going to have to let the back yard die. /  

x          A.49 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

^q          B.50 utt1:  It's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because,   

^2          A.51 utt1:  On its own, -/  

+          B.52 utt1:  we can't really afford the front yard. /  

b          A.53 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  {C And so } when we left, {D you know, }  the back yard had some, {F um, } - /
sd          B.54 utt2: I think it was <child> Saint Augustine that we had.  /
sd          B.54 utt3:   It had held onto a small portion,  /
sd          B.54 utt4: {C but } primarily once the weeds <child> start in the back we were  just, {D you know, } resigned to, {D well, }   the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under --   

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- and put everything back on top of it again.  /
h          B.56 utt2:   {C But, } I don't know.  /
sd          B.56 utt3: That's the bad thing there, is, that we spent so much money,  /
sd          B.56 utt4:  {C or } you would spend so  much money trying to keep a large lawn alive.  /
sd          B.56 utt5:   That was the only thing I didn't like about lawns,  /
sd(^q)       B.56 utt6: {C and } we were sitting there  wondering, there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to  spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out. /  

b          A.57 utt1:  <Laughter> Yes. /  

%          B.58 utt1:  {C So. } -/  

sd          A.59 utt1:  It's pretty remarkable because growing up  we've always had a beautiful, lush green lawn, /
sd          A.59 utt2: {C and } we never, - /
sd          A.59 utt3:  there was no such thing as watering your lawns --   

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.61 utt1:  -- in Missouri.  /
sd          A.61 utt2: It just happened. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } {C so } it's been real fun here  to see, - /
sd          A.63 utt2: there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies,  /
sd          A.63 utt3:  {C and } a <child> lot of people, {F um, } - /
sd          A.63 utt4:  we live in north of Dallas. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

%          A.65 utt1:  {C And, } {F um, } -/  

bf          B.66 utt1:  Arlington area. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  Plano. /  

bk          B.68 utt1:  Okay,  /
b^m          B.68 utt2: Plano.  /
b          B.68 utt3:  Uh-huh. /  

b          A.69 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sd          A.69 utt2: up north <child>.  /
sd           A.69 utt3:  {C And so } there's a lot of  market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in  the Dallas area --   

b          B.70 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.71 utt1:  -- and big market [ for, + for ] [ yards, + yard ] work. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          B.72 utt2: I imagine <child>.  /
sd          B.72 utt3: {C So, } {D well } [ everybody, +   it seems like everyone ] is so  particular, especially in the Dallas area. /  

b          A.73 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.74 utt1:  [  There, + there's ] so much money  /
sd          B.74 utt2:  {C and } everyone can afford, - /
sd          B.74 utt3: they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn.  /
sd          B.74 utt4:  {C And, } another thing  I've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes - /
sd          B.74 utt5: the area is so small --   

b          A.75 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.76 utt1:  -- that they take great pride in being able to  use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice. /  

aa          A.77 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv          A.77 utt2: they do.  /
sd          A.77 utt3: I noticed that they're really  putting in small back yards, because [ they have these, + ] most of the houses have the alleys --   

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.79 utt1:  -- that run behind,  /
sd          A.79 utt2: {C and, so } that really cuts  into your backyard space,  /
sd          A.79 utt3: [ {C and. } {C But } we don't do our work here out of  enjoyment so much as <talking> <<man's voice in background>> - /
sd          A.79 utt4:  right now, [ we're just, + [ this is, + ] we just ]  moved in in September,  /
sd          A.79 utt5: {C so } we're just still at the point where  we're talking about <child> the necessity. /  

aa          B.80 utt1:  Right,  /
sd          B.80 utt2: I know.   /
sv          B.80 utt3: {F Oh, } it's awful the first house.  /
sd          B.80 utt4:  Our house in Castroville was the first one, too.  /
sd          B.80 utt5: {C And } we had no idea the  expense that lawns and  gardening <laughter> would run into --   

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  -- and the time that it took,  especially when you start mowing,  /
sd          B.82 utt2: {C and then } when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking,  /
sd          B.82 utt3:  {C and then } when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the  water. /
sd          B.82 utt4:  {C And } the one thing that I did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems, the sprinkler systems,  [ just, + ] that was the way to go --   

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.84 utt1:  -- if you could do it.  /
sv          B.84 utt2:   People that were building the new homes that put those in, [ that was, + that was ]  the only way to go because it was just so  convenient.  /
sd          B.84 utt3:  They would just turn it on  /
sd          B.84 utt4: {C and } the  timer would run  /
sd          B.84 utt5: {C and } it would water their lawn  /
sd          B.84 utt6: {C and } they didn't have to worry  about it at all. /  

b          A.85 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          B.86 utt1:  {C And } that was so nice.  /
sd          B.86 utt2: {C But, } we didn't  have that luxury,  /
sd          B.86 utt3: {C so } we were dragging [ th-, + the ] sprinkler around everywhere. /  

x          A.87 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.88 utt1:  {C And so, } I hope you can find, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.88 utt2: I don't know  what type of grass grows in the real shady areas.  /
sd          B.88 utt3:  I remember the guy that was on the radio, {F um, } <child>  /
sd          B.88 utt4: they had a gardener,  /
%          B.88 utt5: {C and } he, - /
h          B.88 utt6: I don't know,  /
sd          B.88 utt7: [ I had this one, + {D well } I've still got ] the book.  /
sd          B.88 utt8:  [ It's, + {F um, } I think it's ]  just called TEXAS GARDENING,  /
sd          B.88 utt9: {C and } it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas  versus the really sunny areas. /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Hm.  /
%          A.89 utt2: We, -/  

sd          B.90 utt1:  {C But } there is a grass that you can use that is  shade tolerant,  /
sd          B.90 utt2: {C but } I don't remember what it is.  /
sd          B.90 utt3: {C But } it's got {D like } a boot,  on the front of the book. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  It's just a real fancy decorated boot.  /
sd          B.92 utt2:  It's {D like } TEXAS GARDENING.  /
