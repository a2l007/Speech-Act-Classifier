b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd           A.33 utt1:  It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it. /

%          B.34 utt2:  {D Well, } that is, - /

sd           B.44 utt2:  {C But }  you will probably find after your children get bigger, {F uh, } like when they want things like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store,  you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few  dollars. /  

aa          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /

h          A.71 utt2:  I do not know <laughter>. /  
 
sd           B.72 utt1:  {D Well, } at first, when you first have a baby, [ you, + ] {F uh, } seems to take every moment of your time.  Partly because you are not  used to, {D you know, } juggling your time around like that.  /
