qy          B.2 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>  Do you have, {F uh, } some strong feelings  one way or the other [ about, + about ] the care of the elderly? /  

ny          A.3 utt1:  {D Well, } yes,  /
sd^e          A.3 utt2: I do.  /
sd          A.3 utt3: {F Uh, } this is [ a, + a ]  question that hit pretty close to home.  /
sd          A.3 utt4: I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago.  /
sd          A.3 utt5:   [ He was, + his health was ] failing -- /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } he was adamant about two things.  /
sd          A.5 utt2:   One was that I take care of my mother,  /
sd          A.5 utt3: and two, that he not be put into a home. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {C And } we talked, {F uh, } about some length,  /
sd          A.7 utt2:  {C and } I respected his wishes.  /
sd          A.7 utt3: He, {F uh, } stayed at home as long as he could,  /
sd          A.7 utt4: {C and then, } {F uh, }  he died in a hospital.  /
sd          A.7 utt5:  {C But, } {F um, } I think that, my position [ wa-, + is ]  that, {F uh, } you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care  [ [ of the, + of the, ] {F uh, } of their ] clients -- /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Yes. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F um, } because I've heard about the many  abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.10 utt2: yeah. /  

qo          A.11 utt1:  How about you? /  

sd          B.12 utt1:  {D Well, } <throat_clearing> my graduate work is in  speech pathology,  /
sd          B.12 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } {C so, } {C so, } {F uh, } I've thought about this more than  once, {F uh, } {D you know, } dealing with - /
sd          B.12 utt3:  <throat_clearing> {F uh, } {D you know, }  I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, {F uh, } population, [ in +  in ] twenty years it's going to be, {D you know, } phenomenal. /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qy^g          A.13 utt2: [ almost thirty, + all over thirty ] percent, isn't it. /  

ny          B.14 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ny^r          B.14 utt2: yeah.  /
sd          B.14 utt3:  {F Uh, } <throat_clearing>  {C and, } {F um, } {C but } I have been amazed  /
sd          B.14 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] in talking with, {F uh, } some of my fellow students,   it looks as though, {F um, } nursing homes are not going to be the only option any  more  /
sd          B.14 utt5: {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> in twenty years.  {F Uh, } where a lot  of students are hoping, {F uh, } to work as an in the home type, {F uh, } {F uh, }  approach, [ [ where, + where ] the, + {F uh, } where there's, ] {D you know, } the speech therapist, or  whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to, {F uh, } work out of a  family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow [ the, + the ]  loved one to stay, {D you know, } at home --   

b          A.15 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.16 utt1:  -- with the family members.  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ]  difficult for many families, especially in the case [ of, + {F uh, } of ]  Alzheimer's [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } some of the more degenerative diseases to, {F uh, } {D say, } {F uh, } {F uh, }  [ leave them, + to have them ] at home, because then the family becomes completely, {F uh } -- -/  

sv          A.17 utt1:  They're captive. /  

aa          B.18 utt1:  -- exactly.  /
b          B.18 utt2: Yeah,  /
qr          B.18 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ did, + did ] you experience that [ with your, + with your ] father or not? /  

sd          A.19 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ we  had a, + at one stage we had ]  care somewhat [ like, + like ] what you're talking about.  /
sd          A.19 utt2:   We had the Visiting Nurses program -- /  

b          B.20 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.21 utt1:  -- {C and } they sent somebody in,  /
sd           A.21 utt2: {C and } [ it, + it ]  was [ a, +  a ] nominal charge that [ this, + ] {F uh, } it started out that the lady would come in  I think three times a week and  eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.23 utt1:  They would try to get him to exercise.  /
sd          A.23 utt2:   They would try to, {F uh, } {D you know, } - /
sd          A.23 utt3:  they would check him over [ to, + to, ] {D you know, } the basic checks.  /
sd          A.23 utt4:   Try to get him to talk and be motivated -- /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } that's what we went through.  /
sd         A.25 utt2:  {F Uh, } up to a point things seemed to be working,  /
sd          A.25 utt3: {C and then, } {F uh, }  I think, [ he, + he ] became discouraged -- /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  -- {C and } they did not know how to take care of that,  /
sv          A.27 utt2:  {C and then, } {F um, } at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Oh. /  

aa          A.29 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } {C but, } yes,  /
sd          A.29 utt2:  I agree there's a lot of options.  /
sv          A.29 utt3: There could be a lot of options. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.31 utt1:  I think it's time that, {F uh, }  we decide to do something about it. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          A.33 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

aa          B.34 utt1:  Definitely.  /
sd^t          B.34 utt2: {D You know, } one of the other subjects  on the switchboard, and  this is one that I've been thinking applies here, {F uh, }  <throat_clearing> [ where, + where, ] {F uh, } young, young kids, {F uh, }  graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work.  /
sv          B.34 utt3:   This would be an excellent example of [ some where, + {F uh, } some place ]  where, {F um, } the community could be more involved, {D you know, } more than just leaving it only to professionals.  /
sv          B.34 utt4:   There is a lot [ the community, + the community ] can do to, {F uh, }  [ enhance the, + [ or, + or ] assist ] the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need. /  

sv          B.36 utt1:  Possibly before.  /
sd          B.36 utt2:  I don't know now. /  

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          A.37 utt2: the church or synagogue, whatever --   

b         B.38 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.39 utt1:  -- because typically these were close knit groups  at one time,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: {C but } in today's large metropolitan areas, or [ even in most, +  [ even, + even ] the rural areas ] now, people are not quite as close as they once were. /  

aa          B.40 utt1:  Huh-uh. /  

sv          A.41 utt1:  {F Uh, } the mobility factor, the factor  that, {F uh, } {F oh, } we're living longer and  people are less trusting, all these things tend to  destroy this type of system.  /
sd          A.41 utt2: {C But } I agree with you,  /
sv          A.41 utt3: there might be some  possibilities there. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of  young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do. /  

aa          B.44 utt1:  I agree.  /
sv          B.44 utt2: [ That's a, + that's a ] good point. /  

sv          A.45 utt1:  I think they would have to have some training. /
