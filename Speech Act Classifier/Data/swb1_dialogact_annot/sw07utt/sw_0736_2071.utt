sd         B.2 utt1:  {D Well, } as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that  the other day,  /
sd          B.2 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I really don't know the answer, <laughter>,  /
sd          B.2 utt3:  {F uh, } I would sort of like to, {F uh, } think about something in the way of, {F uh, } {F uh, } sort of a sporty car but  [ not any, + not, {D you know, } a ]  luxury type sporty one. /  

b          A.3 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  But, {F um, } something that still has a lots of amenities and, {D you know, } gadgets and things. /  

qy^d          A.5 utt1:  {F Oh, } you do want a lot of that stuff? /  

ny          B.6 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ny^r          B.6 utt2: {D well, } yeah  /
sd^e          B.6 utt3: [ I like, + I like ]  some of those things.  /
sd          B.6 utt4:  They come in really handy <<clicking sounds in background>>. /  

qw          A.7 utt1:  What kind of, {F uh, } things are you going to consider,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {D you know, } [ what, + ] {F uh, } you said something [ about the, + about the, ] - /
t1          A.7 utt3:   {D well, } what do you call them,  /
sd          A.7 utt4: you said amenities,   

b^m          B.8 utt1:  Amenities. /  

+          A.9 utt1:  that they have,  /
qw            A.9 utt2: {C but } what about, {F um, }  their reputation of the company or the price. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv           B.10 utt2:  {D well, } of course, I guess, {F uh, } price is always the big consideration,  /
%          B.10 utt3: {C but, } -/  

sd          A.11 utt1:  It is for me,  /
sv          A.11 utt2: other people,   

b          B.12 utt1:  yeah. /  

+          A.13 utt1:  don't seem to have the same problem <laughter>. /  

sd           B.14 utt1:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ]  a big one in my book, /  

b          A.15 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd           B.16 utt1:  {C but, } {F uh, } {F um, } I have preferences  [ for, + {F uh, } for ] some, {F uh, } makers over others, {F um, }  /
sd          B.16 utt2: {C and } I would sort of like to buy American, /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd         B.18 utt1:  {C but, } {D you know, } I'm not so totally hung up on that, that <<clicking sounds>> I wouldn't buy something else,  /
qo          B.18 utt2: how about you? /  

sd           A.19 utt1:  {D Well, } {F um, } the last car  (( we )) bought was  American [ because  of, + because of ] that reason,  /
sd          A.19 utt2: {C but } (( have ))  not been entirely  happy with, {F uh, } several things about the car, - /
sd          A.19 utt3: it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be. /  

bh          B.20 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

sd      A.21 utt1:  {C Because } several things,  minor things sort of, - /
sd        A.21 utt2: {C but } still they cost us money,  {F um, } that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car [ that, + that ] was that new,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  {D you know, }  /
sd          A.23 utt2: we bought the car new  /
%          A.23 utt3:  {C and } after, - /
sd           A.23 utt4: {F um, } {D well, } {D well, } {D well } under two years we had to replace the clutch. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd(^q)     A.25 utt1:  {C And, } they just said, {D well, } {D you know, } clutches are  (( disposable )) ,  /
sd(^q)     A.25 utt2: {C and } I said, since when? /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  Brake pads are  (( disposable )) ,   

b          B.28 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.29 utt1:  {D you know, }  /
sd          A.29 utt2: we know that,  /
sd         A.29 utt3: {C but } I never thought a clutch was disposable./  

aa          B.30 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.30 utt2: I wouldn't have thought so either. /  

aa          A.31 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd            A.31 utt2: {C so } [ that was, + that was ]  kind of a shock <laughter>. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Oh.  /
b          B.32 utt2:  Yeah,  /
sv            B.32 utt3: [ I, + I ] guess there's a lot  [ to, + to ] think about when you're trying to make that decision. /  

aa          A.33 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv           A.33 utt2: {D you know, } [ the less {D actually, } + the less ]  you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, - /
sd         A.33 utt3: they're called luxury cars even  though they're much more expensive [ like, + like, ] {F uh, } {F uh, }  a Mercedes Benz,  /
sd            A.33 utt4: they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong  would definitely not be considered disposable. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Right. /  

sv            A.35 utt1:  You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes,   

aa          B.36 utt1:  No  /
%          B.36 utt2: {C but } then, -/  

+          A.37 utt1:  especially not after two years. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  No,  /
sd          B.38 utt2: {C but } on the other hand, I guess, too, {F uh, }  whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune. /  

bh          A.39 utt1:  Really?  /
h          A.39 utt2:  {F Oh } I don't know. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd           B.40 utt2: I've, {F uh, } worked with a couple of people who have owned, {F uh, } various years, {F uh, }   

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  Mercedes  /
sd           B.42 utt2: {C and, } even though they do a lot of the work themself [ then + ] just buying the parts  and everything [ is, + is ]  pretty expensive.  /
sd         B.42 utt3: {C But } for them [ it's, + it's ] sort of a hobby, too,   

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.44 utt1:  to own them  ((   )) . /  

qw          A.45 utt1:  What kind of, - /
qw          A.45 utt2:  what brand of car are you thinking about buying  /
qw      A.45 utt3: {C or }  (( {D like } )) what things are you looking at? /  

sd           B.46 utt1:  {D Well, } I haven't [ re-, +  really ]  gotten that far with it,  {F um, }  /
sd          B.46 utt2: I've always sort of liked General Motors,   

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.48 utt1:  a little bit better than some of the others  /
h        B.48 utt2:  {C but, } {F uh, } {F oh, } I guess, I really don't know. /  

%          A.49 utt1:  How come  ((   )) - /
sd          A.49 utt2:  I've been kind of, {F um, } - /
sd          A.49 utt3: I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials, /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd         A.51 utt1:  {C and } I know that a lot of people  [ I've, + I've ] known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them,  [ that + ] hardly had any problems at all. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.52 utt2: that, - /
%          B.52 utt3: I think that's, -/  

sv          A.53 utt1:  I think they have a really good, {F uh, } quality./  

aa          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd       B.54 utt2:  My, {F uh, } daughter has owned two different ones,/
sd          B.54 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we've had some work done on them  /
sd          B.54 utt4: {C but } it's not  too bad,  /
%          B.54 utt5: {C and } the reason, - /
sd         B.54 utt6: one of the reasons we, {F um, } bought the first one was  because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and  years and years  /
sd          B.54 utt7: {C and } he lived way out in the country  /
sd          B.54 utt8: {C so } he put a lot of miles on it, /  

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.56 utt1:  {C and, } you knew  it [ had, + had ]  been through a whole lot, /  

b          A.57 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.58 utt1:  {C and } yet, {D you know, } [ it, + it ]  held up pretty doggone good,  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {C so, }    

b          A.59 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  I thought they would <clicking>, -/  

sv          A.61 utt1:  They seem to be really durable. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          A.63 utt1:  {D So, } I don't know,  /
sd          A.63 utt2: [ I'm, + I'm ] not ready to buy a new car yet,  /
sd            A.63 utt3: {C but } I don't know,  [ if, + if ] the next time I'm going to try  [ to, + to ] stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more,  what I would consider to be a long-term investment <laughter>. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          B.64 utt2:  {D Well, } - /
sv         B.64 utt3: {C and } I guess, {D you know, }  you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, {D you know, } - /
%          B.64 utt4: you ... -/  

sd        A.65 utt1:  {F Oh, } it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,/
