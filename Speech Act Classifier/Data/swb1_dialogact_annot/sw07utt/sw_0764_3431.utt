b          B.24 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  {C Plus, } {F uh, } they had bunk beds,  /

sd          A.33 utt1:  We used a flat, latex paint -- /  

bk          B.34 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  -- {C and } in the bedroom, as I understand,  that's, {F uh, } one of the better type of paints to have --   

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  -- because it's not so reflective [ and, + and ]  glassy colored,  /
sd          A.37 utt2: {C and } it, {F uh, } turned out real, real well. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  Seems like, {F uh, } [ I've, + we've ] done some  remodeling of some, {F uh, } rental houses that we have -- /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.40 utt1:  -- {C and } it appears as though that, {F uh, } {F oh, }  in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, {F uh, }  they used a lot of, {F uh, } semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints -- /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.42 utt1:  -- {C and } that was a little difficult to  cover with today's paints,

+          B.44 utt1:  it seemed like.  /
sd          B.44 utt2: We had an occasion, {F uh, }  where we had to do some sealing --   

b          A.45 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.46 utt1:  -- [ of, {F uh, } the se-, + of  [ the, + this ] ]  type of paint before we could paint it. /  

bf          A.47 utt1:  {F Oh, } you had to prime it [ and + --

aa          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Huh. /  

qy          B.52 utt1:  You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?  /
qy          B.52 utt2:  You use a particular brand or anything? /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  {D Well, } I like to use [ this, + this ]  Sears, {F uh, } the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee. /  

qy          B.54 utt1:  Weather beater type stuff? /  

ny          A.55 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  {C And } the reason being is once I painted,  I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later -- /  

ba          B.58 utt1:  Understand. /  

%          A.59 utt1:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } - /
sd         A.59 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } we're  quite satisfied with that -- /

sd          A.61 utt1:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] occasionally you can  watch for it and get it on sale,  /
sd          A.61 utt2: {C and } we [ do, +  do ] that.  /
sd          A.61 utt3:  In fact, I was just reading an article, - /
sd          A.61 utt4:  you mentioned painting your bathroom. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  I read an article recently that, {F uh, } you have to  be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does  tend [ to, + to ] peel or come off because of the [ moisture, + high moisture ]  content in your [ bath, + bathroom. ] /  

aa          B.64 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.64 utt2: it's a lot like, {F uh, } wall paper.  /
aa          B.64 utt3:   That's true. /  

qy          A.65 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } did you have any problems  with that  /
%          A.65 utt2: {C or, } -/  

sd          B.66 utt1:  {D Well, } the particular bathroom that we  did is a half bath,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: {C so } we didn't have a problem with that. /  

ba          A.67 utt1:  {F Oh, } good. /  

sd          B.68 utt1:  {F Uh, } [ I have had, + I've, {F uh, } have ]  never experienced that type of a problem --

+          B.70 utt1:  -- {F uh, } with a latex paint. /  

ba          A.71 utt1:  {F Oh, } good.  /
sd          A.71 utt2:  [ Nei-, + neither ] have I <laughter>. /  

sv          B.72 utt1:  {C So, } [ you shouldn't have a, + you shouldn't have a ]  problem with it. /  

ba          A.73 utt1:  {F Oh, } good. /  

sv          B.74 utt1:  [ They're, + they're ] pretty well refined today --   

b          A.75 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.76 utt1:  -- a lot of the paints,  /
sv          B.76 utt2: {C and }  Sears is one of the better ones. /  

b          A.77 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.78 utt1:  I've used, {F uh, } many a gallon of them, myself. /  

qy          A.79 utt1:  [ Do you, + {F uh, } have you ] ever used an oil base paint? /  

na          B.80 utt1:  {F Uh, } used oil base paints for trim --   

b          A.81 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.82 utt1:  -- {D you know, } {D like } around doors [ and, + and ]  on doors, things like that. /  

qw          A.83 utt1:  [ Wh-, + why ] do you use that?  /
sd          A.83 utt2:  [ I'm, + I'm ]  kind of [ learning at this, + new at this, ]  /
qr          A.83 utt3: {C but. }   

sd          B.84 utt1:  {F Uh, } primarily because [ it, + it ]  seems to be a little more, {F uh, } {D well, } let's say -- -/  

+          A.85 utt1:  It adheres better, or lasts longer? /  

nd          B.86 utt1:  -- {D well, } not so much that.  /
sd          B.86 utt2:   It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings --   

bk          A.87 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

+          B.88 utt1:  -- as opposed to, {F uh, } a latex type paint. /  

b          A.89 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.90 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ [ it just, + {D you know, } it, ] + it ]  gives you [ a, + a ] variance even though it's the same color. /  

b          A.91 utt1:  Right.  /
ba          A.91 utt2:  {D Well, } that's good,  /
ba^r          A.91 utt3: that's good. /  

sd          B.92 utt1:  {C So } it's worked out pretty well for us. /  

qy          A.93 utt1:  {F Uh, } have you ever done any painting outside? /  

na          B.94 utt1:  {F Uh, } quite a bit,  /
sd          B.94 utt2: painted a couple of houses.  /
sd          B.94 utt3:  {F Uh, } recently this summer we painted a, {F uh, } out building, which is a shed that  we have on the, -/
