b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+           B.10 utt1:  -- {C and } that's one of the big  things that we always look at, {D you know. }  [ When we, + when I ] think about [ t-, + ] changing jobs  is, {D you know, } {D you know, } what kind of health care they have  /
sd           B.10 utt2: {C and } does the company pay for it.    {D You know, } all or  partially  /
sd          B.10 utt3: {C or } how does that work. /  

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           B.12 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } also, {F uh, } vacation time too [ is a, + is a ] big # one for me. #

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  {F Uh, } # cause I've # --

b          A.21 utt1:  # Right. # /  

+           B.22 utt1:  -- [ some that, + ] sometimes that's  coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,  /
sv          B.22 utt2: {C so } that's not so bad, {D you know. } /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv           B.24 utt1:  {D You know, } it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think. /  

b          A.25 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv           B.26 utt1:  {F Uh, } I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.  /

sv           A.31 utt2:  {F Uh, } [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] another good thing  is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices <laughter> on who to go with. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {C And } that really helped us out a great deal./

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {F Uh, } {C cause } that makes a big difference./

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           B.40 utt1:  {C And } she works, {F uh, } as a assistant manager in a fabric store. /  

b          A.41 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd         B.42 utt1:  {C And so } she works a lot of evenings and weekends/

b          A.45 utt1:  Right. /  

sd           B.46 utt1:  {C And } I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too. /  

b          A.47 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           B.48 utt1:  {E I mean } usually, {D you know, } you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, <clicking> up for school  /
