=============================================================================
  

o          A.1 utt1:  All righty.  /
sd^t          A.1 utt2: {F Uh, } I guess our topic today  is air pollution.  /
sd^t          A.1 utt3: {C And } we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute  most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us. /  

aa          @B.2 utt1:  Right. /  

qy          A.3 utt1:  {F Um, } does your work entitle, {F uh, }  anything of environmental along these lines? /  

sd          B.4 utt1:  [ Me, + I'm ] in the legal department  /
sd          B.4 utt2: {C and, } {F um, }  we do have, {F uh, } a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.6 utt1:  {C And } I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.  /
sd          B.6 utt2:   I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that  T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground, {D you know, }  we're coming up with [ a, + {F uh, } a ] new solution.  /
sd          B.6 utt3:  We have been finding a lot of  toxic places to dump  /
sd          B.6 utt4: {C and } we just transport to these places.   /
sd          B.6 utt5: {C But } after awhile it always  seems that [ the, + {F um, } {F oh, } the ] site starts to leak  /
sd          B.6 utt6: {C and then } you have to clean  it up and such.  /
sd          B.6 utt7:  {C But } the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman,  /
sd          B.6 utt8: {C and } we're  going have that, {D you know, } incineration place up there and,    

b          A.7 utt1:  Right. /  

+          B.8 utt1:  dump everything there.  /
sd          B.8 utt2:  {C And } supposedly that  facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be [ in, + in, ] {D you know, }  [ a + ] confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.  /
sd          B.8 utt3:   And that we won't be polluting the air.  /
sd          B.8 utt4:  I'm sure we have to have, {F uh, }  permits, {D you know, }  for that place.  And that there's, {D you know, }  limits as to what we can, {F uh, } let, {D you know, } go into the air. /  

b          A.9 utt1:  Yeah.  /
%          A.9 utt2:  It's, {F uh, } hav-, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D well, } - /
sd          A.9 utt3:  [ I work in  ((   )) , + I work in ] environmentals, {F uh, } projects right now. /  

bk          B.10 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C And so } the Sherman deal [ is, + ] {F um, } {F uh, } <laughter>  lost a lot of hair over that project. /  

b          B.12 utt1:  Oh <laughter>. /  

sd          A.13 utt1:  {F Uh, } what we run into, {F um, } is we have the  Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, {F uh, } jurisdictions under  which we have to, {F uh, } {F uh, } reply to. /  

b          B.14 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.15 utt1:  {C And } a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real  clear,  so we have our manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B,  {A which is located in Austin, } in writing  /
o          A.15 utt2: {C and, } hey,  /
ad          A.15 utt3: look what we've done here at T I. /  

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.17 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } we are presently, {F uh, }  in receipt of a site permit, which will allow us to, {F um, } <lipsmack> {F uh, } - /
sd          A.17 utt2: this is our side [ a-, +   

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  allow ] to have certain emissions up to a  certain tonnage.  /
sd          A.19 utt2: It's [ [ in, +   

b          B.20 utt1:  Okay. /  

+          A.21 utt1:  in, ] + in ] tons per year.  {F Um, }  /
sd          A.21 utt2: {C and so, } [ [ w-, + w-, ] + {D you know, } what ]  we do to make contributions so that, basically,  we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } scrub out  the, N O X and, {F uh, } V O C's [ and, + and ] ammonia compounds, {F uh, } like all the acids,  to a certain level.  /
sd          A.21 utt3: We,   

b          B.22 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.23 utt1:  are very, {F um, } aware of the  opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.   /
sd          A.23 utt2: {C So } if you don't see anything  coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.  /
sd          A.23 utt3: {C And so } what we go  through is, {F uh, } if you see it smoking there's a problem.  /
sd          A.23 utt4: {C And } having worked with  some of the legal folks very closely, {F uh, } it becomes a real issue,  especially, when it's smoking  /
sd          A.23 utt5: {C and } you have to get it fixed el pronto. /  

%          B.24 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  As you know, [ they, + they're ]  allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime they want, drive through, and see, and inspect. /  

%          B.26 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C So } it's a full time, {F uh, }   everybody has their home phone number type of job. {F Um, } /  

qy          B.28 utt1:  Now is that place built  /
qrr          B.28 utt2: {C or } you're still on the makings of it? /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  The Sherman facility,  we are still  in the, closer too,  but still have a little bit of, {F um, } finalization to do. - /
%          A.29 utt2: Right.  /
sd          A.29 utt3:   It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, {F um, }   

b          B.30 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.31 utt1:  open arms, as well as the public.  /
sd          A.31 utt2:   We had open forum  /
sd          A.31 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } {F uh, } Tom Jones, our [ environmental, +  corporate environmental ] guys handle the project. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } its [ real, + {F uh, } going real ]  well.  /
sd          A.33 utt2: I think it's [ matter, + just a matter ] of [ fund, +   

b          B.34 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  funds ] right now as I understand it.  {F Uh, }  /
sd          A.35 utt2:  {C but } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] something else.  /
%          A.35 utt3:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.35 utt4:  [ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're ]  in the same issue.  /
sd          A.35 utt5: We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.  /
sd          A.35 utt6:  {F Uh, }  {C because } [ the, + the ] system is setup where it won't have any emissions. /
sd          A.35 utt7: You're correct.  /
sd          A.35 utt8:  It will have something coming out of the stackhouse [ it was, +   

b          B.36 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.37 utt1:  it was ] human nature.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:  {C But } it won't have  [ can  any, +  {F uh, } any ] bad stuff.  /
sd          A.37 utt3: {C So, }  {F uh, } I think T I, [ we spend, + ] of all the major  semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost,  foremost, {F uh, } {F uh, } first thing we always look at.   /
sd          A.37 utt4: And we probably put more money  into the systems {C and } engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.  /
sd          A.37 utt5:  We eat and sleep the stuff, everything we do over here. /  

x          B.38 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C and, } {F uh, } it's an interesting job.  /
%          A.39 utt2: {C But } {F um, } -/  

sd          B.40 utt1:  {D Well, } I know from some of the sites  that we've had, {F uh, } quite a list of cites that have gone bad  /
sd          B.40 utt2: {C and } you have to clean up.  /
sd          B.40 utt3:   {C And, } you know the law now is the super fund  /
sd          B.40 utt4: {C and } anybody who's contributed  toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, {D you know, } {F uh, }  damaged the ground or not.  /
sd          B.40 utt5: {F Uh, } everybody has to contribute  /
sd          B.40 utt6: {C and } it's been a lot of big  bucks when we've [ gotten, + {F uh, } gotten ] pulled into these super fund  deals to clean it up and, {D you know, } mega bucks to, {F uh, }  {D you know } take everything out and redo it and, {D you know, }  fill in some other area  /
sd          B.40 utt7: {C and, } {F um, } certainly,  it would to have a better solution, {D like } the Sherman facility  than, {F um, } just letting it go in the ground.  /
sd          B.40 utt8: {C Because } eventually, {D you know, } [ it, + it ]  seems that no matter what they do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind  of cement lined, {F uh, } dump area.  /
sd          B.40 utt9: It still only in time starts to leak out. /  

am          A.41 utt1:  Possibly. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  [ There, + there ]  was one site that they cleaned up  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C and then } the new place leaked again.  <laughter>  ((   )) . /  

aa          A.45 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          A.45 utt2:  I'm familiar with that one. /  

x          B.46 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.47 utt1:  [  We have, + we have ]  stuff that's very interesting, {F uh, }  /
sd          A.47 utt2: we have hoods,  /
sd          A.47 utt3: we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment  where, {F um, } they have, {F um, } that we sample -- /  

sd          B.48 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  -- {C and } it may have over, {F uh, }   a certain emission levels,  /
sd          A.49 utt2: this is on the (( solid side )) ,  /
sd          A.49 utt3: {C and so } we take it  /
sd          A.49 utt4:  {C and, } {F uh, } we can't  (( deep well ))  inject something like that because it's a solid.  /
sd          A.49 utt5: {C And }  we mix it with concrete --   

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  -- and {D actually, } {F um, } potash, per se, and  concrete and then actually put it in the ground.   But [ not so, + not ]  in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab. /  

%          B.52 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  It was totally legal.  /
sd          A.53 utt2:  {C But } the cost of doing  this is astronomical,   

%          B.54 utt1:  {F Um, } /  

+          A.55 utt1:  they actually show you what duckwork and things.  /
sd          A.55 utt2:  {C And so } we were, {F uh, }  very, very, {F uh, } cognizance of, and aware of all  these types of, {F uh, } expenditures because it could get very expensive.  /
sd          A.55 utt3:  {C But } I think [ we, + {F uh, }  {D you know, } we ]  do all kinds of things to make [ the, + the ]  world a better place to live, {D you know, }  /
sd          A.55 utt4: I think some of the folks that aren't  aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.  /
sd          A.55 utt5:   I really would.  /
sd          A.55 utt6:  {F Um, } <lipsmack> I've enjoyed speaking with you, /

sd          A.57 utt3: I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the  corporate, or in the north building <laughter>. /
