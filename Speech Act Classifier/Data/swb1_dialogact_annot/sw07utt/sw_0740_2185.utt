sd          A.1 utt1:  {D Well, } I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done. /  

b          B.2 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.3 utt1:  {C And } the last time that, {F um, } we tackled it, I did the kitchen. /
sd          A.3 utt2: {C And } I had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark, - /
sd          A.3 utt3:  it was called a sassafras,  /
sd          A.3 utt4: it was kind of an orangish brown. /  

b          B.4 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.5 utt1:  It was not real pretty. /  

b          B.6 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {D Anyway, }  {C so } the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color. /  

b          B.8 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b          B.8 utt2: I see. /  

sd          A.9 utt1:  <Laughter> {C So } I tried to cover it with white,  /
sd          A.9 utt2:  {C and } it was quite [ a, + a ] feat getting that dark a color covered, and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets,  /
sd          A.9 utt3: {C and } [ know + ] if I look underneath my cabinets, I'm not satisfied with the jobs [  I, + I ] did on it because there're splotches. /  

b          B.10 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  {C But, } I'm glad it's done, because it's brighter. /  

aa          B.12 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.12 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          B.12 utt3: that's for sure. /  

x          A.13 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

%          B.14 utt1:  {D Well, } we, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.14 utt2: I just got married about six  months ago,  /
sd          B.14 utt3: {C and } we bought a house at the same time.  /
%          B.14 utt4:  {C So } we're, - /
sd          B.14 utt5:  I'm sitting here in my forty year old house,  /
sd          B.14 utt6: {C and } we're about halfway through the painting  process <laughter>. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } lord. /  

%          B.16 utt1: {D So, } {F uh, } the only, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.16 utt2:  I guess [ the, + the ] big discussion, just kind of what you were mentioning, has been the color.  /
sd          B.16 utt3:   We ended up with [ our, + our ] living and  dining room are now, {F uh, } kind of [ a, + a ]  light peach color with, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.16 utt4: {C and } it's got all the old, original hardwood trim and stuff,  /
sd          B.16 utt5: {C so } we've  got the trim in [ kind of, + {F uh, } kind of ] an off-white.  /
sd          B.16 utt6:  {C And } this is really  the first, {F uh, } interior painting project that I've attacked.  <laughter>  /
sd          B.16 utt7: {C And, }  [ [ it's, +  it's  ] been, + {F uh, } it's been ] something else, to say the least.  /
sd          B.16 utt8: [  We, + we ] had the same type of situation.  /
sd          B.16 utt9: {F Uh, } the walls were, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
sd          B.16 utt10:  {D well, } they weren't, - /
sd          B.16 utt11: the color difference wasn't so bad,  /
sd          B.16 utt12: {C but, } {F uh, } there was  semigloss underneath -- /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.18 utt1:  -- {C and } we put a flat over the top,  /
sd         B.18 utt2: {C and } everywhere  you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see <laughter>.  /
sd          B.18 utt3:   It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint. /  

b          A.19 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sd           B.20 utt1:  <Laughter> Every time the sun would come up in the  morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can.  /
sd          B.20 utt2: {C But, } {F uh, } we've learned.  /
sd          B.20 utt3: [ [ [  We, + we, ] + {F uh, } we ] worked, + we've worked ] our way back into the  hallway,  /
sd          B.20 utt4: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we're in the middle of the bathroom now.  /
sd          B.20 utt5: {C But, } {F uh, } [  it's, + it's ]  been quite an adventure.  /
sd          B.20 utt6: <<pause>> [ The other, + the other ] thing that  makes it, {F uh, } a little more difficult, we've got all hardwood floors,  /
sd          B.20 utt7: {C and, } {F uh, } [ we, + we've ]  learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors  [ since the, + since the ] first <laughter> time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a  [ tooth, + toothbrush ] and what not cleaning up. /  

qw          A.21 utt1:  {C So } what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried? /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {D Well, } [ it's, + it's ] not too bad.  /
%          B.22 utt2:   It, it, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.22 utt3: the floors are finished with a polyurethane, /  

b          A.23 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd*         B.24 utt1:  {C and } it's really not to bad to get off,  / *[[typo to -> too]]
%          B.24 utt2: it, - /
%          B.24 utt3: it, - /
sd          B.24 utt4:  we're just using latex,  /
sd^r          B.24 utt5: {C and } it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even.  /
sd          B.24 utt6: [ [  It, + it, ] + it, ] {F uh, } comes off with {D like } a mild abrasive pad, like a scotch-brite pad or something like that [ and wa-, + and soap ] and water.   /
sd          B.24 utt7: {C So, } we got pretty lucky on that. /  

qy^d          A.25 utt1:  {C And } it's not scratching your floor,   

nn          B.26 utt1:  No,  /
ng          B.26 utt2: not really. /  

+          A.27 utt1:  because it's so thick.   /
ba          A.27 utt2: {F Oh, } that's pretty good. /  

%          B.28 utt1:  {C But. } -/  

sd          A.29 utt1:  We painted every room in this house, some of them {D like } two, three times.  /
sd          A.29 utt2: We have two children. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Okay,  /
b          B.30 utt2: yeah. /  

sd         A.31 utt1:  {C And, } they just, - /
sd          A.31 utt2: they ruin, <laughter>, -/  

x          B.32 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.33 utt1:  it's just terrible what they do. /  

b          B.34 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.35 utt1:  {C And then } I have been coloring my hair,  /
sd          A.35 utt2: {C and }  I'm real haphazard when I do it.  /
sd          A.35 utt3: {C So } I've got dye on my bathroom door. /  

ba          B.36 utt1:  {F Oh, } gosh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {C And } I haven't figured out how to get that off.  /
sd          A.37 utt2:   I guess I'll have to take that door down and really get it good. /  

aa          B.38 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa^r          B.38 utt2: yeah,  /
aa          B.38 utt3: probably so. /  

sd          A.39 utt1:  {C And then } we have a two story. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  We did the outside of it one summer. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.43 utt1:  That was horrendous.  /
sd         A.43 utt2:  {E I mean, } [ I, + I ]  couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder.  /
sd          A.43 utt3:   I could get up on the roof and do that. /  

b          B.44 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  <Breathing>  {C But, }   

b          B.46 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          B.46 utt2: I, {F uh, } -/  

+          A.47 utt1:  I dread that the next time. /  

aa          B.48 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          B.48 utt2: [ we, + {F uh, } our ] house was painted as part of the purchase contract,  /
sd          B.48 utt3: {C so } we didn't have to mess with that this time.  /
sd          B.48 utt4: {C But } [ [ I've, + I, ] + I ] grew up on a farm,  /
sd          B.48 utt5: {C so }  [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] messed with outdoor painting  a little bit, {F uh, }  /
sd          B.48 utt6: {C but } most of that, it was done with a sprayer and, {F uh, } up in the bucket of a  loader tractor, or  something like that,  /
sd          B.48 utt7: {C so, } it took a lot of the hassle out.  /
%          B.48 utt8:  {C And then } --   

b          A.49 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.50 utt1:  -- they're, - /
sd          B.50 utt2: [ we're not, + {D you know, } you're not ]  nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery, or something like that as you would be  with your own house. /  

aa          A.51 utt1:  No,  /
sv          A.51 utt2: I wouldn't think so <laughter>. /

sd          A.55 utt1:  {F Oh, } we got to do that this summer.  /

b          B.56 utt1:  Yeah  /
x          B.56 utt2: <laughter>.   

sd          A.57 utt1:  It's like, they're dark. /  

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah. /

sd          B.62 utt12: I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all [ in a, + in a ] washtub or something somewhere  because [ I'm alwa-, + I'm always ] afraid that the next coat is not going to match. /  

b          A.63 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          B.64 utt1:  {C But, } {F uh. }  It's gone pretty well.  /
%          B.64 utt2:   It just, - /
sd          B.64 utt3: [ [ it, + it, ] takes, + it takes ] some time.  /
sd          B.64 utt4: My problem is, while  I, - /
sd          B.64 utt5: I'm  not overly proud of it,  /
sd          B.64 utt6: {C but } I'm a self-proclaimed, [ proclaimed + ] perfectionist,  /
sd          B.64 utt7: {C and }  [ it, + it ] takes me a long time to do trim and things like that.  /
sd          B.64 utt8: {C And } [ I'll find, + I'll find ]  something as I'm going along, something not related,  /
sd           B.64 utt9: [ like, + like, ] {F uh, }  I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because, [ they, + they ]  really didn't match.  /
%          B.64 utt10: They were, - /
sd          B.64 utt11:  a few of them were broken and things like that.  /
sd          B.64 utt12:  {C So, }  I always pick up these little extra tasks as I'm doing this, /
sd          B.64 utt13:  [ {C and, } + <laughter> {C and } ] the painting actually takes probably, {F uh, } a fourth of the time,  /
sd          B.64 utt14:  {C and } I'm always doing all this other stuff,  /
sd          B.64 utt15: {C and } my wife's hollering at me and  wondering what else I've come home with from work this time [ to, + to ]  put in, a ceiling fan or something strange like that.  /
%          B.64 utt16: {C So } {F uh, }  [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] always, - /
sd          B.64 utt17: [ [ it, + it, ] + it ]  gets you to look at everything real hard when [ yo-, + you ]  start putting a coat of paint on everything,  /
sd           B.64 utt18: you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere. /  

sd            A.65 utt1:  {F Oh, } {C but } I still feel good, the minute I put that paint on, <laughter> even if it does got a dent in it -- /

sd          B.74 utt5: part of the excitement [ was, +  was ]  getting a good deal on an older house that just, [ it + ]  really hadn't been taken care of very well.  /
