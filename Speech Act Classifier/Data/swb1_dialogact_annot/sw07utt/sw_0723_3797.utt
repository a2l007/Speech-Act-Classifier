sd^t          B.1 utt1:  I guess we're ready to talk. /  

fp          A.2 utt1:  How you doing, Howard?  /
sd^t           A.2 utt2: This is [ a, +  a ] subject that I'm not real well versed on,  /
%          A.2 utt3: {C but. } -/  

ad          B.3 utt1:  {D Well, } let's talk about air pollution. /  

aa          A.4 utt1:  Okay. /  

qw         B.5 utt1:  What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?  /
qw          B.5 utt2:   {C Or } where are you from? /  

o          @A.6 utt1:  No. /  

qy^d          B.7 utt1:  Maybe you're not in Dallas. /  

o          A.8 utt1:  Okay,  /
sd          A.8 utt2: I'm from the, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.8 utt3: I'm from Dallas.  /
sd          A.8 utt4:   I'm in Richardson. /  

bk          B.9 utt1:  Okay.  {F Uh, } /  

qo           A.10 utt1:  What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area? /  

sd          B.11 utt1:  {D Well, } I have some small experience in this area.  /
sd            B.11 utt2:   The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown --   

b          A.12 utt1:  Right. /  

+           B.13 utt1:  -- a lot of that is, {F uh, } tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates.  /
sd           B.13 utt2:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ the, + ]  one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.  /
sd           B.13 utt3:  That's because of all the equipment that's being operated.  But at the same time, {F uh, }  because [ we don't have, + we don't ] burn a lot of coal and solid materials we,   

x          A.14 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

+          B.15 utt1:  don't get a lot of particulates.  /
sd         B.15 utt2:   Now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas. /  

b          A.16 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          B.17 utt1:  {F Uh, } power plants since, -/  

x          A.18 utt1:  <Throat_clearing>.   

sd           B.19 utt1:  many of our local power plants, {F uh, } are natural gas most of the time, {F uh, } the things that come off of those plants are carbon  dioxide, and N O X.  /
sd          B.19 utt2: There's no particulates in natural gas, of course.  /
sd           B.19 utt3: {C And }  we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products.  /
sd          B.19 utt4:   We're burning fuel oil and a few other things,  /
sd           B.19 utt5: {C but } gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, {F uh, } I guess you could say we're  picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur.  /
sd           B.19 utt6:  That's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter --   

bh          A.20 utt1:  {F Oh, } really? /  

+          B.21 utt1:  -- the sulphur, yes.  /
sd           B.21 utt2: {C And } that's, {F uh, } course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor --   

b          A.22 utt1:  Sure. /  

+          B.23 utt1:  -- and that goes back in with your sulphur  /
sd        B.23 utt2: {C and }  under the right condition you get H two S. /
%          B.23 utt3:  {C But, } anyway, {F uh, } -/  

sv           A.24 utt1:  {D Well, } [ you are, + you are ]  well versed on the subject, I tell you. /  

bd          B.25 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't know. /  

sd          A.26 utt1:  This is not one of my better ones.  /
sd            A.26 utt2: [ I guess, + <throat_clearing> I guess ] I notice it the most just, {F uh, } in driving around  Dallas with all [ the, + <inhaling> the ] highway equipment that's working [ on  the +  --   

b          B.27 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.28 utt1:  -- on, ] six thirty-five and seventy-five,  just the cars in general.  /
sd          A.28 utt2:  That's where I see most of it. /  

%          B.29 utt1:  Ro-, - /
sd           B.29 utt2: {F uh, } Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is. /  

b          A.30 utt1:  Right. /  

sd           B.31 utt1:  {C And } when they run rich [ they, + they ] spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,  /
sd          B.31 utt2: {C and } that's another part of the problem.  /
sd          B.31 utt3:  The gas is not being burned completely.  /
sd           B.31 utt4: {C But, } {F uh, } hopefully, if we ever get our road  system fixed up, this will get a lot better. /  

sd           A.32 utt1:  {F Oh, } I don't know, I've lived here since seventy-four,  Howard,  /
sd           A.32 utt2: {C and, } [ I d-, + ] [ I think, + I think ] they been working on the highways  around here since I've been here, /  

x          B.33 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sv            A.34 utt1:  {C and } [ I think, + I think ] they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone. /  

sd           B.35 utt1:  {D Well, } I guess, [ I, + ] not trying to top  you, but I grew up in Dallas county and  I can remember when they built the north part of North  Central which was built after the south part of --   

b          A.36 utt1:  Right <laughter>. /  

+          B.37 utt1:  -- Central  /
sd           B.37 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, {F uh, } I don't know, little bit north of [ mark-, + ] Mockingbird on up [ in, + ] over those hills  /
sd(^q)       B.37 utt3: {C and } I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road. /  

x          A.38 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd           B.39 utt1:  Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and [ are, + ] off ramps,  /
fe          B.39 utt2: {C but, } gosh,  /
sv          B.39 utt3: seems like, {F uh, } those ramps might kill us yet.  /
%          B.39 utt4:   I, - /
sd          B.39 utt5: hopefully the new ones will be a lot better. /  

ba          A.40 utt1:  I understand.  /
sd          A.40 utt2:  I sure hope so, I tell you.  /
sd           A.40 utt3:  {D You know, } you get out on the, {F uh, } interstate highways versus, - /
sd          A.40 utt4: I travel quite a bit  /
sd           A.40 utt5:  {C and } traveling from, {D like, } Dallas to Austin to San Antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles [ in the, + in the ]  stalled traffic and the busy highways, [ [ you, + you, ] + you're ] at your best  /
sd           A.40 utt6: {C and, }  I guess when you're out on the interstate, <inhaling> heading north or south and you're just  cruising right along and there's no build up of cars  /
%          A.40 utt7: {C and, } -/  

b          B.41 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qy           B.41 utt2: Ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, I guess towards Waxahachie, Hillsborough on down to Austin,   

x           A.42 utt1:  <Noise>.   

+           B.43 utt1:  you hit a point down there about, I think where they call Bear Creek exit --   

ny          A.44 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          B.45 utt1:  -- on just this side of the county line <static>.  /
sd           B.45 utt2:  Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.  /
qy          B.45 utt3:  Have you noticed that? /  

ng          A.46 utt1:  I tell you what, [ I, + I ] don't think I really have,  /
sd^e          A.46 utt2: {C but } I'm going that way Tuesday  /
co          A.46 utt3: {C and } I'm going to make it a point to. /  

sd           B.47 utt1:  {D Well, } sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing -- /  

b          A.48 utt1:  Sure. /  

sd          B.49 utt1:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } I also travel a little bit  /
sd            B.49 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier.  /
sd          B.49 utt3: It may be all in my mind. /  

aa          A.50 utt1:  {F Oh, } I know. /  

x          B.51 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          A.52 utt1:  I know going to, {F uh, } {F uh, } - /
