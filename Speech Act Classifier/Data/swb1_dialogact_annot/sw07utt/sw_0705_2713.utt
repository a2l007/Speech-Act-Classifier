sd           B.38 utt4: {C And } it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not  because a lot of times  (( these ))  computer things will just make up numbers  at random and just call them. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd           B.40 utt1:  {C And so } it [ really, + really ] doesn't make much  difference as to whether or not, {D you know, } you have a unlisted number or not.  /

b          A.41 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /  

+           B.42 utt1:  # {D you # know, } then you'll start getting a bunch of  stuff in.  [ And a bunch of stuff + and a bunch of stuff ] because they sell their  customer list,  /

sd          A.49 utt2: {C and }  you hear the other person too,  /
sd          A.49 utt3: {C so } it's kind of a double annoyance.  /
sd           A.49 utt4: He actually, {F uh, } ruins  my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway.    

b          B.50 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
b^r          B.50 utt2: uh-huh. /  

+           A.51 utt1:  {F Uh, } that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about  ready to say something, {F uh, } if he's  (( even thought of )) that that's a  real uncourteous thing, [ an, + an ] invasion of everyone else's time [ and, + and ] concentration to just be loud.  /

sd           B.64 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } they finally, {F uh, } stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,
