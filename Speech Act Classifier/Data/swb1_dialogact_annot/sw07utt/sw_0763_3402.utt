o          A.1 utt1:  All right.  /
sd^t          A.1 utt2: I guess tonight's subject is to  discuss current events and how we keep up on current events, and if we're --   

aa          B.2 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.3 utt1:  -- satisfied [ with, + with ] the, {F uh } --

+          @A.5 utt1:  -- coverage that we receive. /  

aa          B.6 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.7 utt1:  {F Um, } thinking about it,  some of the ways I try and keep up on current events is, {F uh, } I enjoy reading the newspaper,  but, {F uh, } quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper,  /
sd          A.7 utt2: {C and so, } {F uh, } I  enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also, {F uh, } some of the news periodicals, {F uh, } weekly magazines,  /
sd          A.7 utt3: {C and, } {F uh, } at work I also have, {F uh, } management  summary reports that, {F uh, } give basically a lot of the current events.  /
qo          A.7 utt4:  {F Uh, } how about yourself? /  

sd          B.8 utt1:  {D Well, } I'm like you.  /
sd          B.8 utt2: [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I like ]  to read the paper  /
sd          B.8 utt3: {C but } I basically don't do it every day, /  

x          A.9 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.10 utt1:  {C and } [ I, + {F um, } I ] usually watch, {F uh, }  either GOOD MORNING, AMERICA or the TODAY SHOW, every morning --   

b          A.11 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.12 utt1:  -- while I'm, {D you know, } - /
sd          B.12 utt2: whatever I'm doing,  I watch that.  /
sd          B.12 utt3: I usually watch the news, either at, {D you know, }  early evening or at ten o'clock -- /  

b          A.13 utt1:  Right,  /
b^r          A.13 utt2: right. /  

sd         B.14 utt1:  -- {C so } I get it from T V a lot.  /
sd          B.14 utt2:  [ I get TIME MA-, + I read TIME MAGAZINE ] <lipsmack>.  /
sd          B.14 utt3: {F Um, } that's one I read pretty regularly. /  

ba          A.15 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah.  /
bk          A.15 utt2:  # Okay. # /

bf          A.17 utt1:  You think that that's, {F uh, } pretty  adequate coverage  /
%          A.17 utt2: {C and } you get. -/  

+          B.18 utt1:  The thing about it, {D you know, }  now that I've [ fo-, + found, ] is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, {A I don't know, }  attempted thoroughness --   

b          A.19 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.20 utt1:  -- of coverage, by the time you get  the TIME [ MAG-, + MAGAZINE, ]   

x          A.21 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+          B.22 utt1:  there's nothing in it you don't know. /  

qy^g          A.23 utt1:  It's historic events, huh. /  

na          B.24 utt1:  Right.  /
sv          B.24 utt2:  Then you can just sort of have pictures  to go along with it or  something, because {D really, } I've thought lately,  there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE. /  

bk          A.25 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sv          B.26 utt1:  {D You know, } [ it's, + it's, ]  basically you've heard everything -- /  

aa          A.27 utt1:  Yes. /  

sv          B.28 utt1:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } [ you might, + you might ]  get a little more thorough, {F uh, } account of something,  /
h          B.28 utt2: {C but } really, {F um, } I don't know.  /
sd          B.28 utt3:  {C So } I get most of mine from television -- /  

b          A.29 utt1:  Yeah. /  

h          B.30 utt1:  -- I would say. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {F Um, } I found out too, that, {F uh, } quite often  if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, {F uh, }  understanding [ or, + or ] [ get, + ] want to know more about  it, that [ the, + the ] newspaper or, {F uh, } [ I read + ] NEWSWEEK, can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V,  /
sd          A.31 utt2:  {C but, } {F uh, } {F um, } I found out that also [ on, + on ] T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N  /
sd          A.31 utt3: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] like  you said, [ the, + the ] news shows [ that are, + that are ] happening, - /
sv          A.31 utt4: {C and } you can read some  more about it if you want to.  /
sd          A.31 utt5: {F Um, } I found out, though that, - /
sv          A.31 utt6: {C or } I feel that a lot  of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative.  /
sv          A.31 utt7: There's an awful lot of negative  news [ or bad news, + [ or, + or ] bad news. ]  /
sv          A.31 utt8:  {C And } it'd be refreshing once in  a while to hear some good news. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Right -- /  

%          A.33 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh. } -/  

sv          B.34 utt1:  -- {C and } [ I, + I ] think there's an attempt to do that.  /
sv          B.34 utt2:   {D You know, } I think people, - /
sv          B.34 utt3:  there's a mild attempt for that,  /
sv          B.34 utt4: {C but } I think [ basically, +  we basically ] associate news with bad news --   

aa          A.35 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv          A.35 utt2: we do. /  

+          B.36 utt1:  -- [  or, + or ] catastrophes or problems or crises, [ or, + ]  {F uh, } {D you know. }  /
sv          B.36 utt2:  I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.  /
sv          B.36 utt3:  It's more negative, like you said. /  

aa          A.37 utt1:  True,  /
aa^r          A.37 utt2: true. /  

sv          B.38 utt1:  {C But, } [ I think people try to, +  [ on, + on ] T V I think, they try to ] throw in good stuff,  /
sv          B.38 utt2: {C but } [ it doesn't, + {F uh, } it doesn't ] sway the vote. /  

b          A.39 utt1:  Uh-huh.  /
sd         A.39 utt2:  I've heard an [ interes-, + interesting ]  comment also that, {F uh, } with budget cuts and, {F uh, } expenses the way they are  that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a  in-depth analysis or, {F uh, } investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues,  /
sv          A.39 utt3:  {C but } that takes time,  /
sv          A.39 utt4: that takes an awful lot of money and commitment,  /
sv          A.39 utt5: [ {C and, } + {C and ]  } quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing -- /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv         A.41 utt1:  -- {C and } [ go after, + {D you know, } it's lot easy to go after ]  and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, {F uh, } find out news  from that as opposed to going out and finding good things,  /
h          A.41 utt2: {C so. } I don't know,  /
sv          A.41 utt3:  I guess the economy [ is, + is ] effecting also the news media -- /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  -- {C and } we have to pay that price,  /
h          A.43 utt2:  {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know,  /
h^r          A.43 utt3: I don't know.  /
sv          A.43 utt4: It's interesting,  /
sv          A.43 utt5: {C and } I think that nowadays with  communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening [ as, + as ]  they occur --   

b          B.44 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.45 utt1:  -- all over the world, like the, -/  

sv          B.46 utt1:  {D You know, } the war last winter was  certainly a good example of that --   

aa          A.47 utt1:  Exactly.  /
%          A.47 utt2:  # We saw, # -/  

+          B.48 utt1:  -- # because we saw # every single thing, practically. /  

aa          A.49 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {D you know, } twenty years ago, thirty years ago,  we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege [ or, + or ] luxury [ to, + to ]  view that.  /
%          A.49 utt3: {C So. } -/  

sd          B.50 utt1:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } I remember, {D well, }  just the things that are covered. /
sd          B.50 utt2:  I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake,   

x          A.51 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

+         B.52 utt1:  and just seeing that happen --/  

ba         A.53 utt1:  {F Oh, } yes. /  

sd          B.54 utt1:  -- {E I mean, } {D you know, } that was just  so phenomenal to see this stadium shake --   

b          A.55 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          B.56 utt1:  -- [ and the, + and the ] announcers, {D you know } grabbing, /  

x          A.57 utt1:  <Laughter>.   

sd          B.58 utt1:  {E I mean, } it's like, that was just something --   

ba          A.59 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.60 utt1:  -- because that was {D like } live and real --
