sv          A.11 utt3:   {D You know, } {D like } it's easier for you to go to and run a program,   

b          B.12 utt1:  Uh-huh. /

sv          A.17 utt1:  Then, [ as the, + {D you know, } as you ]  go up higher, {D like } in your senior level, you're doing projects which [ are, + are ] so big,  /
sv          A.17 utt2:  {C and } you have to have so many people sharing the same data,   

b          B.18 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  that you can't use personal computers,  so you have to use, {D you know, } a main frame. /  

aa          B.20 utt1:  Right,  /
aa^r          B.20 utt2: right.  /

bk          A.21 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

sd          B.22 utt1:  {C And, } [ that, + that's ] been my situation,  is that, {F uh, } that way I can get in, access our, {F uh, } computers that I have up  here and, {D you know, } do work from home. /  

qy          A.23 utt1:  {C But } does it have, {F uh, } {D like, } a disk drive? /

bk          A.25 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: {C because, } {F uh, } the ones that  we use, [ yo-, + ] {D you know, } are like UNIX base systems. /  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.26 utt2: Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.27 utt1:  {C And, so } they don't have a disk drive. /  

b          B.28 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.29 utt1:  {D You know, } {C so } you can't, - /
sd         A.29 utt2: the only way that  you can do it is through a modem. /  

b          B.30 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.31 utt1:  {C And, } [ you, + {D you know, } you ] just do it that way. /  

b          B.32 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  {C But, } [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ]  the only way that you can get [ to, + through to ] the system,  /

aa          B.34 utt1:  Right.  /

o          B.34 utt3: no  /
sd          B.34 utt4: [ [ I, + {F um, } I, ] + I ]  have both, because [ that, + that's ] what I use all the time is UNIX Systems.  {F Um, } versus the DOS.  /
sd          B.34 utt5:   {C But } then I teach DOS classes, {F uh, } at night. /  

bk          A.35 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: part time.  /
%          B.36 utt3: {C So, } -/  

bf          A.37 utt1:  {C And then } you also have to do all your  grading on the P  C. /  

sd          B.38 utt1:  {D Well, } [ that, + that's ]  the really neat thing, I teach in the continuing education classes, so [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't ]  have to have [ grad-, + any grades, ] no grade books, so that's great <laughter>. /  

bk          A.39 utt1:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

o          B.40 utt1:  {C But, } no,  /
sd          B.40 utt2: I find that I use [ the, + the ]  personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect,   

b          A.41 utt1:  Okay. /  

+          B.42 utt1:  and also for my spread sheets. /  

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Um, } {C so } I think it's extremely helpful and  very useful. /  

sd          A.45 utt1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } for us [ it's, + {F uh, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } it's ] like for doing {D like, } {D you know, }  {D like } resumes,   

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.47 utt1:  and, presentations. /  

b          B.48 utt1:  {F Um, } {F um. } Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.49 utt1:  We use {D like } for example, a Mackintosh,  which is a lot easier for graphics,   

b          B.50 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.51 utt1:  [ than the P-, + than ] {D you know, }  the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that. /  

b          B.52 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.53 utt1:  [ Due, + due ] to the fact that,  {D well, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] haven't tested [ the, + the ] P S two yet. /  

b          B.54 utt1:  {F Um, } {F um. } Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.55 utt1:  {C but } I don't know if the software is as  easily, {D you know, } like you can manage it a lot easier [ than, + than ] the old one. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  The old one you had to go pick a line,  use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where,   

b          B.58 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.59 utt1:  you know, with the mouse you do it, {D you know, } {D like, } a hundred times  faster. /  

aa          B.60 utt1:  That's true.  /
aa^r          B.60 utt2: That's true. /  

sd          A.61 utt1:  {C And, } {F uh, } you also get, {D you know, } - /
sd          A.61 utt2:  when you see it on the Mackintosh with, {D you know, } the one I have, - /
sd          A.61 utt3:  that doesn't have any color,  /
sd          A.61 utt4: you can look at it  /
sd          A.61 utt5: {C and } that's the way it's going to print out. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.63 utt1:  {C And, } especially if you have a laser printer,  it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen. /  

b          B.64 utt1:  {F Oh, } Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.65 utt1:  {C And, so, } [ with, + {D you know, } with ]  the I B M what would happen is, {F uh, } since the software that I had was, it was basically, {D you know, }  you only see part of the page. /  

b          B.66 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.67 utt1:  {C And, so, } the whole page [ you, + you ]  never can actually see it, /  

b          B.68 utt1:  Oh. /  

sd          A.69 utt1:  you just draw it  /
sd          A.69 utt2: {C and } they have to zoom  out and zoom in  /
sd          A.69 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } it's like, every time that you have to do  something [ is, + ] it's really a pain. /  

ba          B.70 utt1:  What a hassle,  /
b          B.70 utt2: yeah,  /
b^r          B.70 utt3: yeah. /  

sd          A.71 utt1:  {C And, } also, {D  you know, } it's like  [ for, + for ] presentations,  /
sd          A.71 utt2: it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily  represented [ on a, + on a ] P C. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd^r          A.73 utt1:  it can be easily represented [ on a, + on a ] P C.  /
sd          A.73 utt2:   {D You know, } {D like } years back when you didn't have that you would have to map  out [ all this, + all these ] numbers. /  

b          B.74 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.75 utt1:  and get a graph which you weren't sure if it  was okay or not, {D you know. } /  

b          B.76 utt1:  Right.  /
b          B.76 utt2: Yeah. /  

sd          A.77 utt1:  {C But, } [ with a, + with a ]  new system I can calculate everything so fast,   

b          B.78 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.79 utt1:  {D you know, } like for spread sheets. /

b^r          B.80 utt2:  Right. /  

sv          A.81 utt1:  You can see what the trend is over the years. /  

b          B.82 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sd          B.82 utt2:  {C And, } I love all the windows that  they have out now too, /  

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah,  /
%          A.83 utt2: [ [ that, +   

sv          B.84 utt1:  they have really simplified things. /  

+          A.85 utt1:  that ] - /
sd          A.85 utt2: [ [ [ I, + I ] had a, + I had a ]  program due  /

b^r          B.86 utt2: Right. /  

+          A.87 utt1:  so if there was ever a mistake,  I could easily check, {D you know, }  /
sd(^q)       A.87 utt2: I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error. /  

b          B.88 utt1:  Right. /  

sd(^q)       A.89 utt1:  Instead of saying, where did I make the error? /  

b          B.90 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.91 utt1:  {D You know, } go back and forth  /

sd          A.91 utt3:  the old ones you had to go out of your program,  [ load up, + {F um, } {F uh, } {D well } load up ] the program again,   

b          B.92 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.93 utt1:  in this case.  /

x          B.94 utt1:  <Laughter>.

b          B.98 utt1:  Yes. /  

+          A.99 utt1:  and then go back and see if that worked or not. /  

b          B.100 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sd          A.101 utt1:  {C But } with windows you can have the  program  /

sd          A.103 utt2:  you take a look at the output at the same time,  /
sd          A.103 utt3: {C and } you can see [ that, + ]  where it messed up, because, {D you know } it's like in the old computers, the ones that, {F uh, }  we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout,
