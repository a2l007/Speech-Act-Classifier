sd          B.22 utt4: {C and } I haven't found anything yet that  keeps me there on a constant basis.  /

aa          A.23 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.23 utt2: I have the same situation.  /
sd          A.23 utt3:  I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT, /  

b          B.24 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sd          A.25 utt1:  # {C and } # they'd just stack up.  /
sd          A.25 utt2:  I wouldn't find time to read them.  /
sv          A.25 utt3:  You have to have time to sit down and concentrate [ on, + on ]  the stories  /

b          B.26 utt1:  # Uh-huh. # /

sv          A.27 utt2: {C and } you wind up throwing  them out without reading them. /  

aa          B.28 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.28 utt2: that's true. /  

sv          A.29 utt1:  {C Because } it's too much trouble to try and  catch up,  /
sv          A.29 utt2: {C so } --     

aa          B.30 utt1:  That's true, /  

+          A.31 utt1:  -- have to depend, - /
sv          A.31 utt2: I guess we're becoming more  of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, {F uh, } my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section. /  

ba          B.32 utt1:  {F Uh, } oh no <<said laughingly>>. /  

sd          A.33 utt1:  There's is all, {F uh, } strictly television news. /  

sd          B.34 utt1:  A little bit that worries me, because I feel like  the news is so biased. /  

aa          A.35 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

sd          B.36 utt1:  {C And } yes,  /
sd          B.36 utt2: they report facts,  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {C and } yes  /
sd          B.36 utt4:  you can get an idea of what's going on,  /
sd          B.36 utt5: {C but, } {D you know, } it's, an, - /
sd          B.36 utt6: {C and } I wish they would  just report the incident and  then leave the commentaries out.  /
sd(^q)       B.36 utt7:  {C But } so many times you  get, {D well, } {F uh, } this is my opinion of what he meant by that, /  

b          A.37 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sd(^q)       B.38 utt1:  # {C and } # I'm like, who are you to judge.  {D You know, } /  

aa          A.39 utt1:  # Right,  /
sv          A.39 utt2: it's the same #   

^q          B.40 utt1:  # just report the facts.  # /  

+          A.41 utt1:  thing  with, the news magazines, like TIME  [ and, + and ] the other magazines. /  

b          B.42 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.43 utt1:  It's hard [ [ to celebr-, + {F uh, } to celebrate, ] + to separate ]  the news from the comment, because,   

b          B.44 utt1:  # <Clanging>  Yes.  # /  

+          A.45 utt1:  # in the # way it's presented their opinions is  print, or presented as being the news. /  

b          B.46 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.47 utt1:  {C And so } then you have to try and sort out what  really is the news. /  

sv          B.48 utt1:  {C And } I feel like they sensationalize things  that shouldn't be sensationalized.  /
sv          B.48 utt2: I feel like they focus too much on  things that, {A I don't know, } {D you know, } - /
sv          B.48 utt3: so  much during the Gulf War, they would ask questions that, {F uh, } you wouldn't want broadcast.  /
sd(^q)       B.48 utt4:  It's  like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is. /  

aa          A.49 utt1:  # That's right.  # /  

sd          B.50 utt1:  # {C But } they # keep asking these questions  /
sv          B.50 utt2:  {C and } I thought it was really, {D well } {A I don't know, } asinine actually. /  

b          A.51 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          B.52 utt1:  Stupid. /  

sv          A.53 utt1:  {D Well } so many of them also come through  /
sv          A.53 utt2:  {C and } they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time.   Whether it be the homeless or, {F uh, } cancer or whatever  /
sv          A.53 utt3: {C and then } they devote, {F uh, }  an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind. /  

aa          B.54 utt1:  Uh-huh,  /
aa          B.54 utt2: yes. /  

sv          A.55 utt1:  # {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } #   

aa          B.56 utt1:  # I agree.  # /  

+          A.57 utt1:  particularly the local television.  {F Uh, }  I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit  /
sv          A.57 utt2: {C and } they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and  leave out something.  /
sd          A.57 utt3:  I'm not saying that's not important, /  

b          B.58 utt1:  # Yeah. # /  

sv          A.59 utt1:  # {C but } # they leave out a real news issue to  devote to one of their local pet projects. /  

aa          B.60 utt1:  Yeah,  /
aa          B.60 utt2: that's true,  /
aa^r          B.60 utt3: that's true,  /

%          A.61 utt2: <laughter>  s-, -/  

sd          B.62 utt1:  {C So } [ I guess, + I guess ] when I get to  listen to the news, [ it's, + it's ] probably television or radio.  /
sd          B.62 utt2:  I see very little paper  /
sd          B.62 utt3: {C but, } [ I, + I ]  don't get to see that as much as I want  /

aa          A.63 utt1:  <Laughter> [ That's, + {D yeah, }  that ]  makes sense.  /
%          A.63 utt2: We, {F uh, } again, - /
