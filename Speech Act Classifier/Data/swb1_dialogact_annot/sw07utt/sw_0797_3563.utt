ny          B.5 utt1:  Yes. /  

aa          A.6 utt1:  All right,  /
sd^t          A.6 utt2: basketball. /  

b          @B.7 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.8 utt1:  I guess I'm probably a lot like you.  /
sd          A.8 utt2:  I'm a Dallas Maverick fan. /  

sd          B.9 utt1:  {D Well, } I certainly am too.  /
ad          B.9 utt2:   Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year. /  

sd          A.10 utt1:  {D Well, } unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal  out of them.  /
sv          A.10 utt2:  They just have too many problems, too many ailments,  too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.  /
sv          A.10 utt3: {D You know, } when Roy Tarpley  just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.  /
sd          A.10 utt4: I feel --   

%          B.11 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

+          A.12 utt1:  -- like everyone else,  /
sd          A.12 utt2: I feel sorry for Donald Carter and  the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.  /
sv          A.12 utt3: It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be [ a final, + a final ] team playing for all of it. /  

aa          B.13 utt1:  Yes, sir. /  

sd          A.14 utt1:  National championship or the world championship, and  something like this happens. /  

b          B.15 utt1:  Oh.  /
qy          B.15 utt2:  {D Well, } do you think it's time that we go for  new, {F uh, } coaches?  /
qy          B.15 utt3:  Is that part of our problem? /  

ny          A.16 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv^e          A.16 utt2: I think at this time, we're just in [ a, + a ]  rebuilding type of phase, {D you know. }  /
sv          A.16 utt3:  I think that probably be evident  with [ the more and more, + the more and more ] young guys they draft.  /
%          A.16 utt4:  {C But, } -/  

sv          B.17 utt1:  {D Well, } it just, it's so discouraging that  they can't really, - /
sv          B.17 utt2: {E I mean, } they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.  /
sd          B.17 utt3: [ I, + I'm ] awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on [ and, + and ] do.  /
qw          B.17 utt4:  Roy, who's your next best team,  /
qw          B.17 utt5: {C or } who do you like after the Mavericks? /  

fe          A.18 utt1:  {F Oh, } gosh,  /
sd          A.18 utt2:  I'm so much a [ Maverick, + Maverick ] fan I don't know.  /
sd          A.18 utt3: Probably the Boston Celtics.  /
sd          A.18 utt4:  I've just always like the Boston Celtics.  /
sv          A.18 utt5: [ They have a, + they have a ] similar situation in that a lot of  old guys on the team,  /
sv          A.18 utt6: {C and, } {C but } they're still playing good ball. /  

%          B.19 utt1:  {D Well. } -/  

sd          A.20 utt1:  {C But } [ I'm, + I've ]  always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,  /
sd          A.20 utt2: {C but, } {D you know, } I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,  /
sd          A.20 utt3: {C so } being a  transplanted Texan [ in, + in ] the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks. /  

sv          B.21 utt1:  We certainly need to support them,  /
^g          B.21 utt2: do we not. /  

ny          A.22 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          A.22 utt2: we do.  {D You know. } /  

qy          B.23 utt1:  Do you go to the game? /  

ny          A.24 utt1:  Yes,  /
sd^e          A.24 utt2: I go to a few games.  /
sd          A.24 utt3:  I haven't been to many.  /
sd          A.24 utt4:  I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.  /
sd          A.24 utt5:  I was a season ticket holder of the  Cowboys for years,  /
sd          A.24 utt6: {C and } when my kids got to a certain age and  went off to school and college and  doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself <laughter>. /  

aa          B.25 utt1:  Yes,  /
sv          B.25 utt2: it does <laughter>.  /
sv          B.25 utt3:  I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there. /  

aa          A.26 utt1:  {F Oh, } you bet. /  

sv          B.27 utt1:  {C But, } {F um, } [ maybe next, + maybe they ]  can do some.  /
h          B.27 utt2:  I don't know,  /
qw          B.27 utt3: who do they need to trade? /  

no          A.28 utt1:  {D Well, } I don't know.  /
sv          A.28 utt2: It seems like  Rolando Blackman [ and, + and ] Harper sort of carry the team,  /
%          A.28 utt3: they just, - /
h          A.28 utt4:  I don't know,  /
sv          A.28 utt5: I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,  /
sv          A.28 utt6:  {C but, } {C and } that can really help the team,  /
sv          A.28 utt7: {C but } they do that,  /
sv          A.28 utt8:  they trade the nucleus of their power right now. /  

aa          B.29 utt1:  Yes, sir,  /
sd          B.29 utt2: it seems that way to me.  /
sd          B.29 utt3:  [ I, + course I ] don't know any of the newer ones that they have  /
sd          B.29 utt4: {C and } I'm not well versed on their  capabilities,  /
sv          B.29 utt5: {C but } we really need to do something. /  

sd          A.30 utt1:  {D Well, } {D you know, } I feel like, {F uh, } the best they   can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.  /
sd          A.30 utt2: I like  their coach.  /
sd          A.30 utt3: I really like ((   ))  a lot, - /
sv          A.30 utt4: {C and } [ I just, + I think ]  he deserves a good break.  /
sv          A.30 utt5: I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he  can do for the club.  /
sv          A.30 utt6:  [ I think + Donald Carter, the owner,   I think ]  with all he's invested, he deserves a --   

%          B.31 utt1:  I really. -/  

+          A.32 utt1:  -- a healthy team for one year and a good break also. /  

ba          B.33 utt1:  Yes, sir. /  

sv          A.34 utt1:  This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset  everyone, I think.   Fans, owners, management, everyone. /  

sv          B.35 utt1:  {C And } they have just done as much as they  can for that man,  /
sd          B.35 utt2: {C and } he apparently can't straighten his act out,  /
sv          B.35 utt3: {C so } we need [ to, + to ]  build on something more positive than that. /  

aa          A.36 utt1:  You bet.  /
sv          A.36 utt2: I think they're fools if they ever  bring him back <laughter>. /  

aa          B.37 utt1:  {F Oh, } I do, too.  /
sd          B.37 utt2:  I certainly would agree to that. /  

sd          A.38 utt1:  Hate to put it that way.  /
sd          A.38 utt2:   I just would not believe him any more. /  

%          B.39 utt1:  {D Well, } it, {F um, } - /
sv          B.39 utt2: {E I mean, } you can't give, <laughter>  anyone too many chances -- /  

aa          A.40 utt1:  No. /  

sv          B.41 utt1:  -- {C and } I think he has gone over the limit. /  

sd(^q)       A.42 utt1:  There's an old saying  [ you can, + you can ]  lead a horse to water  /
^q          A.42 utt2: {C but } you can't make him drink.  /
%          A.42 utt3:  {C So, } -/  

aa          B.43 utt1:  That's right. /  

sv          A.44 utt1:  {C And } I think Tarpley's just a sad case. /  

%          B.45 utt1:  {D Well. } -/  

sv          A.46 utt1:  {C But } to be making [ a, + a ]  million dollars a year, that's pretty sad. /  

aa          B.47 utt1:  It is tragic.   /
%          B.47 utt2: I don't, {F um, } - /
sv          B.47 utt3: {E I mean, } we're  going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our  athletes, I think. /  

aa          A.48 utt1:  {F Oh, } I think you're right.  /
sv          A.48 utt2:  Everything has been put out of perspective now.  /
sd          A.48 utt3: {D You know, } you take [ a, + a ] young kid Roy  Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league,  /
sd          A.48 utt4: {C and } now he's probably an  old age of, {F uh, } twenty-five or six --   

ba          B.49 utt1:  Yes, sir. /  

+          A.50 utt1:  -- and making all that money,  /
sv          A.50 utt2: {D well, } [ [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] quite a, + that's a ] little more of a challenge for a young man than [ they, + they ]  need at that point in their life, I think. /  

aa          B.51 utt1:  I think you're right.  /
sd          B.51 utt2:  I believe that one,  /
%          B.51 utt3: {C so. } -/
