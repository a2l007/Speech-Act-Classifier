sv          B.65 utt3:  {E I mean, }  generally in the Midwest it seems to be [ less, + much less. ]  /
sv          B.65 utt4: {E I mean, } maybe it's because of the winters.    

aa          A.66 utt1:   Probably. /  

+          B.67 utt1: {F Uh, } or maybe just because, {D you know, } [ there's, + there's ] a lot more flat lands, {D you know, } out in the West. /  

b          A.68 utt1:   Yeah. /

sd          B.81 utt3: {C And so } I thought I'd try it, too. /  

qy          A.82 utt1: Have [ you ever had a, + {F uh, } {A it's kind of slightly off the subject, but } you ever had [ a, + {F uh, } a ] ] blood workup done recently or since you've been biking,

%          B.85 utt1:   {F Um. } /  

sd          A.86 utt1: -- {C and, } {D you know, } [ it, + {F uh, } <breathing> it ] kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, {F uh, } {F uh, } low cardiovascular fitness, and also, {F uh, } {D you know, } the cholesterol. /  

b          B.87 utt1:   Uh-huh. /
