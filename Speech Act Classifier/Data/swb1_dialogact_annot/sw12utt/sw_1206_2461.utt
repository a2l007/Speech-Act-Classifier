ba          @B.4 utt1: Fantastic.  /
sd          @B.4 utt2: {D Well } one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, {F uh, } about the, {F uh, } funding of, [ the, + the ] school system right now. /  

b          A.5 utt1:  Yeah. /  

sv          B.6 utt1:  Evidently, {F uh, } [ that's, + that's ] a big problem. /  

b          A.7 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.7 utt2: it's amazing, {F uh, }  /

sd          A.9 utt3: {C 'cause } I did some teaching part-time  /
sd          A.9 utt4: {C and } I really enjoyed that  /

sd          A.9 utt6: it just, {D you know, } all the problems. /  

b          B.10 utt1: {F Oh, } Lord, {E I mean, } yeah,  /

sd          A.11 utt2: they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,  /
sv          A.11 utt3: I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready. /  

%          B.12 utt1:  Do, - /
b          B.12 utt2: right. /  

sv          A.13 utt1: [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid. /  

aa          B.14 utt1:  Exactly,  /
%          B.14 utt2: {C and, } -/

aa          B.16 utt1: <Laughter> That's right,  /
sv          B.16 utt2: {C and then } they, {F uh, } poof it off, {D you know, } do like Tarpley. /  

b          A.17 utt1:  Yeah. /  

%          B.18 utt1: {C But, } {F uh, } I (( )) - /
sv          B.18 utt2: what gets me is I can't believe that [ Congress, + {F uh, } {E or, } our state legislature ] can't come up with, {F uh, } some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.  /
%          B.18 utt3: {D You know, } it's, {F uh, } - /
sd          B.18 utt4: I just don't understand that. /  

b          A.19 utt1: Yeah,  /
%          A.19 utt2: it's, {F uh. } - /
qy          A.19 utt3: {D Now } do you have little kids, or what? /  

nn          B.20 utt1: No, {F uh, }  /
sd^e          B.20 utt2: sure don't,  /
sd          B.20 utt3: my wife and I've just been married about two years  /
sd          B.20 utt4: {C but } I have a sister that's a, {F uh, } school teacher,  /
%          B.20 utt5: {C and, } {F uh. } -/  

b          A.21 utt1: Yeah,  /
b^r          A.21 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.21 utt3: my wife and I have [ a, + a ] three year old, almost four and [ a, + a ] two year old. /  

b          B.22 utt1:  Okay. /  

sd          A.23 utt1: {C So } we're looking at [ the, + the ] older one going to school next year. [ [ Not, + not, ] + {D well } not ] this coming fall but the year after that. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Okay,  /
bf          B.24 utt2: {C so } it's getting close. /  

aa          A.25 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.25 utt2: he's going to be going to kindergarten,  /
%          A.25 utt3: {C so. } -/  

b          B.26 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.27 utt1: {C So, } {D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] thinking about that.  /
qh          A.27 utt2: What's that going to be like.  /
qh          A.27 utt3: Are they going to be taught nothing,  /
qh          A.27 utt4: {C or } they going be taught something,  /
sd          A.27 utt5: [ we're going to, + we're going to ] be involved in our child's education.  /
sd          A.27 utt6: We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course,   

b          B.28 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.29 utt1: because, {F uh, } I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, {F uh, }  /
sv          A.29 utt2: [ {C but. } +   

aa          B.30 utt1:  Exactly. /  

+          A.31 utt1: {C But } ] if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere.    

aa          B.32 utt1:  Right,  /
aa          B.32 utt2: that's true. /  

+          A.33 utt1: {D You know, }  /
sv          A.33 utt2: {C and } we're going to try to teach him good values, because, {D you know, } [ [ we-, + when, ] + when ] they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, {D well } hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important.  Not if you can read or write, [ or do, + or [ un-, + understand ] ] some science.    

aa          B.34 utt1:  Exactly. /  

+          A.35 utt1: {D You know, } - /
o          A.35 utt2: {E I mean } give me a break,  /
sv          A.35 utt3: [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] bogus. /  

aa          B.36 utt1: Right,  /
aa^r          B.36 utt2: right.  /
sd          B.36 utt3: {D Well } {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } one thing my wife and I've talked about, [ i-, +  are, ] {F uh, } private schools.    

b          A.37 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.38 utt1: {D You know } whether, {F uh, } {F uh, } we would want to invest [ in, + in ] private schools as they're [ g-, + growing ] up, because, {D you know, } just in the Dallas area, {F um, } we're not real comfortable [ with the, + with the ] public schools. /  

sd          A.39 utt1: {C And } Dallas, {F uh, } school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Right. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  I couldn't believe that. /  

b^r          B.42 utt1:  Right.  /
sd          B.42 utt2:  {D You know, } <breathing> [ one, + that's one  ] reason we bought a house here in Plano.  /
sd          B.42 utt3: We were hoping, {D you know, } {D well }  the school districts going to be good, {D you know, } for resale value, and,   

b          A.43 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          B.44 utt1: so on and so forth,  /
sd          B.44 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } I can definitely, {F uh, } see on down the road, {D you know, } where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. /  

b          A.45 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd          A.45 utt2: [ we talked, + you talked  ] [ about + before, about  ] the school funding.  /
sv          A.45 utt3:  I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way  /
sv          A.45 utt4: {C but } I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.  /
sv          A.45 utt5:  That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, [ and + ] people are going to throw a fit. /  

%          B.46 utt1: That's, - /
b          B.46 utt2: yeah,  /
%          B.46 utt3: {C and, } {D you know, } that's, - /
sv          B.46 utt4: taxes right now are political suicide.    

b          A.47 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.48 utt1: {D You know, }  /
sv          B.48 utt2: {C and } I don't think any politician's going to do that,  /
%          B.48 utt3: {C so. } -/  

b          A.49 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.49 utt2: {C and } the only thing, [ they, + they ] would think of would be tuition, {D you know, }  /
sv          A.49 utt3: if it works at colleges it will work down below. /  

b          B.50 utt1:  Right. /  

sv          A.51 utt1: {C And, } {D you know, } [ that's going to, + that's going to ] affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do.  /
sv          A.51 utt2: {C But, } it will be hard for those that people, that [ have, + have ] in school because they have to pay out even more. /  

aa          B.52 utt1: Exactly.  /
sv          B.52 utt2: {C And, } {D you know, } it's going to really hurt [ the, + the ] middle class, {F uh, } people, I think.   

b          A.53 utt1:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

+          B.54 utt1: Because, {F uh, } they're the ones that will probably have [ to, + to ] carry the brunt of the load. /  

aa          A.55 utt1:  That's right. /  

%         B.56 utt1:  {D So, } {F uh, } -/  

sv          A.57 utt1: {C And } most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns [ and, + and ] knives and everything, - /
fe          A.57 utt2: {E I mean, } good grief  what's (( )) . -/  

b          B.58 utt1: Yeah  /
sd          B.58 utt2: {D now, } [ that's, + that's ] just unbelievable to me, {D you know. } /  

sd          A.59 utt1: I can't believe that.  /
sd          A.59 utt2: {E I mean } when I was in junior high and high school that never happened.  /
sd          A.59 utt3: You never heard about that. /  

b          B.60 utt1:  {D Well } yeah,  /
sd          B.60 utt2: [ we didn't, + we didn't ] even think about it, {D you know } <laughter>. /  

b          A.61 utt1: No.  /
qh          A.61 utt2: {C And } now, {D you know, } what do we have now.  /
sd          A.61 utt3: {D You know, } got kids that, (( )) either got [ a, + {D you know, } a ] Magnum gun school, - /
fe          A.61 utt4: {D like } good grief. /  

b          B.62 utt1:  [ R-, + right.  ] /  

sv          A.63 utt1: {E I mean, } [ I'd, + I'd ] be afraid to [ be in school, + {E I mean } b-, teaching, ] or even being a student  /
ad          A.63 utt2: {C and } think [ what, + what's ] it going to be like for [ [ my, + my youngest, ] + [ an + ] my oldest ] son, when he goes to school.  /
qh          A.63 utt3: What's going to happen?  /
sd          A.63 utt4: {E I mean } [ I, + I'm ] afraid for him to go. /  

aa          B.64 utt1:  Exactly,  /
aa          B.64 utt2: right. /  

sv          A.65 utt1:  {C But } there  (( again )) , you can't hold them back. /  

%          B.66 utt1: Another reason, yo-, - /
sv          B.66 utt2: {C and } you want to encourage them, {D you know, } [ to, + to ] be active and everything in school,  /
sv          B.66 utt3: {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, [ it is, + {F uh, } it's ] a tough environment to be growing up in. /  

aa          A.67 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          A.67 utt2: and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,  /
%          A.67 utt3: {C and } that was, - /
sd          A.67 utt4: {D well }  [ I was, + I graduated ] high school in nineteen seventy-nine,  /
%          A.67 utt5: {C so. } -/  

b          B.68 utt1:  Okay. /  

qy^d          A.69 utt1:  That was what, twelve years ago, I guess. /  

na          B.70 utt1:  Right. /  

sv         A.71 utt1: {C So, } {D you know, } it's lot different now.   /
qh          A.71 utt2: {C And } what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, {F uh, } oldest son is in high school. /  

aa          B.72 utt1:  That's right,  /

h          B.74 utt2: {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know,  /
sv          B.74 utt3: [ I, + I ] guess what you have to do is just, {F uh, } keep [ in, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } encouraging them [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } try to be open with them, so that [ y-, + you ] can deal with the problems as they come up. /

+          A.79 utt1: even when they're a teenager and they, {D you know } are kind of standoffish,  /
