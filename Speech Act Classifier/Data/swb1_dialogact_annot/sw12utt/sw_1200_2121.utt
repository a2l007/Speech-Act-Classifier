o          A.1 utt1: Okay, {F uh, }  /
qw          A.1 utt2: could you tell me what you think contributes most to, {F uh, } air pollution? /  

^h          B.2 utt1: {D Well, } it's hard to say.  /
sv          B.2 utt2: {E I mean, } while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, {F uh, } pollute a lot, {F uh, } if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, {F uh, } it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.  /
qo          B.2 utt3: What do you think? /  

sd          A.3 utt1: {F Um, } {D well, } you talked about, {F uh, } volcanos.  /
sd          A.3 utt2: I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, [ and, + and ] what the amount of material that they do, {F uh, } put into the atmosphere.  /
sv          A.3 utt3: I think probably the greatest cause is, {F uh, } vehicles,   

b          B.4 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.5 utt1:  especially around cities.  /

b          B.10 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.11 utt1:  It's mainly farms and, {F uh, } no heavy industry.  /

+          A.15 utt1: where T I's plant is,  /
sd          A.15 utt2: {C but } there isn't a lot of heavy industry.  /
sd          A.15 utt3: There's the freeways  /
sd          A.15 utt4: {C and } we get an occasional, - /
sd          A.15 utt5: it depends which way the winds blowing from Boston, cause we're {D like } forty miles south of Boston,  /
sd          A.15 utt6: {C so } we'll pick up that.  /
sd          A.15 utt7: {C And, } {F uh, } I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.15 utt8: we live about twenty miles away from the state airport  /
sd          A.15 utt9: {C and } I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,  /

b          B.16 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sv          A.17 utt1: {C And, } it seems like, {F uh, } we're catching all that residue.  /
sd          A.17 utt2: I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping.  /
sd          A.17 utt3: {C But, } other than that, {D you know, } we don't have [ the, + {A unless we're catching it from the midwest, } the ] emissions.   

b          B.18 utt1:  Yeah. /  

+          A.19 utt1:  {D You know } from the power plants.  {F Um. } /

sd          A.23 utt3: {C but } I'm not sure about the rest of the country. /  

b          B.24 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sv          B.24 utt2: I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.  /
sv          B.24 utt3: {F Um, } it's interesting  /
sd          B.24 utt4: {C because } in order to, {F uh, } keep with the E P A standards [ which, + which  ] tend to be visible, {F uh, } what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night.  /
sd          B.24 utt5: {F Uh, } {C so } people get up, -/  

b          A.25 utt1:  Okay,  /

ny          B.26 utt1:  Yeah,  /
sd^e          B.26 utt2: people get up in the morning in that neighborhood  /
sd          B.26 utt3: {C and } they've got this black ash on their cars,

b          B.30 utt1: Yeah,  /
sv          B.30 utt2: {E I mean, } I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/  

b          A.31 utt1: Yeah.  /
sv          A.31 utt2: [ There, + there ] must be, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ some of the, + some of the, ] {F uh, } larger plants [ up, + {F uh, } up ] around one hundred twenty-eight. /

sd          A.33 utt1: {F Um, } we've got reports that, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.33 utt2: during the night seems like they'd blow off [ their, + their ] stacks from, {F uh, }   

b          B.34 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.35 utt1:  the warehouses, for powerhouses, /  

b          B.36 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.37 utt1:  {C and, } they do that at night too, because,   

b          B.38 utt1:  Right. /  

+          A.39 utt1: employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, {D you know, } spots all over them. /  

b          B.40 utt1:  Yeah,  /
b^r          B.40 utt2: yeah. /  

sd          A.41 utt1:  {C So, } you're right,  /
sv          A.41 utt2: they could do something [ [ a-. + about,  ] + about  ] that, I guess. /  

aa          B.42 utt1:  Yeah.  /
sv          B.42 utt2:  That seems a little ridiculous. /  

qo          A.43 utt1:  How are [ your, + {F uh, } your  ] lakes,  /
%          A.43 utt2: {C and, } {F uh, } -/  

sd          B.44 utt1:  {F Oh } they've been getting cleaner. /

na          B.46 utt1: Sure.  /
%          B.46 utt2: {C But, } {F um, } yeah,  /
sd          B.46 utt3: I'm not sure how much the water pollution [ is, + is ] directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain,  /
%          B.46 utt4: yeah, /  

b^m          A.47 utt1:  Acid rain,  /
b          A.47 utt2: yeah,  /
sd          A.47 utt3: [ that's, + that's  ] what I was, {F uh, } -/  

sd          B.48 utt1: {E I mean } the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, {F uh, } overstated.  That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.  /
%          B.48 utt2: {F Um, } ye-, - /
h          B.48 utt3: I'm not an expert. /

aa          A.49 utt2: no.  /
qy          A.49 utt3: Didn't they just have an article, {F oh, } on, {F uh, } - /
sd          A.49 utt4: they were dumping lime. /  

b             B.50 utt1:  {F Um.} /

sd          A.51 utt1:  [ Up, + upstate  ] New York somewhere,   

sd          B.52 utt1:  I haven't read that. /  

+          A.53 utt1:  over huge areas, /  

b          B.54 utt1:  {F Oh } yeah. /  

sd          A.55 utt1: {C and } they thought that was more beneficial because, {D you know } [ [ it, + it, ] + some of it ] does soak in  /
sd          A.55 utt2: {C and } some of it runs off right away [ into the, + in to the ] streams and rivers  /
sd          A.55 utt3: {C and } some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback. /  

b          B.56 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

sd          A.57 utt1:  I can't remember where - /
sd          A.57 utt2: [ I, +  I  ] read that recently somewhere,  /

b          B.58 utt1:  Yeah,  /
ba          B.58 utt2: that's interesti-, /  

sv          A.59 utt1: {C But } [ I, + I ] thought it was up there.  /
sv          A.59 utt2: {C So, } that's interesting because New Hampshire,   

b          B.60 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  

+          A.61 utt1: and parts of Vermont, {F um, } they showed pictures [ of, + of ] extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain. /  

%          B.62 utt1:  {F Um. } /  

qy          A.63 utt1:  {F Um, } you kind of think it's something else then? /  

nd          B.64 utt1:  {D Well, } that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.  /

"          A.65 utt2: they just said they thought it was, -/  

na          B.66 utt1: They didn't say what,  /
sd          B.66 utt2: they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected.  {F Um, } that it may be other natural things at work.  {F Um, } /

aa          B.68 utt1:  Yeah,  /

h          B.70 utt1: {C But, } {F um, } I don't know,  /
qw          B.70 utt2: {E I mean, } what do you think we can, {F uh, } I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, {F uh, } air pollution? <<pause>>. /  

sv          A.71 utt1:  {F Uh, } we can demand, {F uh, } more efficient automobiles for one thing.  /
sv          A.71 utt2:  I still think [ that's, + that's,  ] {F uh, } one of our major causes of pollutants. /  

b          B.72 utt1:  Uh-huh. /  
sv            A.73 utt1: {F Uh, } how we go about that, [ it's + {F uh, } {F uh, } it's ] a little bit difficult. /

sv          B.74 utt1:  I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers [ for, +

+          A.81 utt1:  {F Uh, } if you can get those types of groups. /  

qy          B.82 utt1: Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.  /
sd          B.82 utt2: {E I mean, } I remember reading an article that said {D like, } it's, {F uh, } the older polluters,  /
sd          B.82 utt3: [ the, + the ] twelve and fifteen year old cars, {D you know, } contribute {D like } ninety percent,   

b          A.83 utt1:  Yeah, /  

+          B.84 utt1: of the automobile pollution  /

sv          A.85 utt2: they're better,  /
qh          A.85 utt3: {C but } how about all the trucks and buses that are out there.  /
qw          A.85 utt4: {F Uh, } when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, {F uh, } -/  

b          B.86 utt1:  Yeah,  /
qy          B.86 utt2: {C but } doesn't that just mean they're out of tune. /  

no          A.87 utt1: {F Uh, } I'm not really sure.  /

b          A.95 utt1:  {F Um, } yeah,  /
sv          A.95 utt2: {C but } only because we got used to, {F uh, } single person, single car,
